Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from the trial court\u2019s order designating her a\n\nvexatious litigant and denying her statement of inability to pay costs. The appellee who\n\nfiled the motion is Nicholas Denbrock, the father of Andrews\u2019s daughter. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arises from a modification suit Andrews filed pro se on December 18,\n\n2024\u2014just three weeks after the trial court rendered a final order in another modification\n\nsuit on November 26, 2024.2 Over the next two months, Andrews filed sixteen additional\n\nmotions and pleadings. These included multiple emergency motions, amended petitions,\n\nmotions to reconsider, motions to stay, and notices claiming constitutional violations.\n\nAndrews also requested electronic access to the child, moved to declare Denbrock a\n\nvexatious litigant, filed special appearances challenging jurisdiction, and demanded\n\n\u201cimmediate return of child.\u201d\n\nAndrews filed a declaration of inability to pay costs, claiming $0 monthly income,\n\n$8,165 in monthly expenses, $1,800 in assets, and $118,500 in debt.\n\nDenbrock moved to declare Andrews a vexatious litigant based on her numerous\n\nfilings. At the hearing, the trial court asked Andrews to provide documentation supporting\n\nher inability to pay. Andrews initially claimed she received no notice, then stated the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over her. When pressed again, Andrews objected and continued\n\nasserting the court lacked personal jurisdiction.\n\nThe trial court found that Andrews refused to present proof of her financial records\n\nand ordered her to pay court costs. The court granted Denbrock\u2019s vexatious litigant\n\nmotion and required Andrews to post a security bond or face dismissal with prejudice of\n\nher pending motions. The order prohibits Andrews from filing new pleadings for\n\n2 Andrews\u2019s appeal from that decision is In the Interest of E.K.D., No. 07-24-00342-CV, also\nresolved this day.\n\faffirmative relief as a pro se litigant without first obtaining permission from the local\n\nadministrative judge. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.102(a). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI. Jurisdiction\n\nDenbrock contends this Court lacks jurisdiction because the vexatious litigant\n\norder is not final. However, the Third Court of Appeals has held that interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom prefiling orders designating a person as a vexatious litigant are permissible.\n\nSerafine v. Crump, 665 S.W.3d 93, 102 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2023), rev\u2019d on other grounds,\n\n691 S.W.3d 917 (Tex. 2024). Principles of horizontal stare decisis require this Court to\n\nfollow the authority of the Third Court as if we were sitting as that court. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 41.3; Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645 S.W.3d 251, 258 (Tex. 2022). We therefore exercise\n\njurisdiction over Andrews\u2019s appeal.\n\nII. Vexatious Litigant Designation\n\nChapter 11 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code establishes procedures\n\nfor designating vexatious litigants. A court may designate a plaintiff as vexatious if the\n\nplaintiff has either: (1) commenced, prosecuted, or maintained five litigations as a pro se\n\nlitigant in seven years with additional necessary findings; or (2) after a litigation has been\n\nfinally determined against the plaintiff, repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate the\n\nsame issues against the same defendant. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.054(1),\n\n(2).\n\f We review the court\u2019s vexatious litigant determination for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSerafine, 665 S.W.3d at 105. Constitutional claims are reviewed de novo. Fontenot v.\n\nFontenot, 667 S.W.3d 894, 911 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2023, no pet.).\n\nA. Fundamental Parental Rights\n\nAndrews argues the vexatious litigant designation violates her fundamental\n\nparental rights by preventing her from filing motions to protect her child. We addressed\n\nthis argument in Byars v. Evans, concluding that requiring a parent to seek permission\n\nfrom the local administrative judge before filing affirmative pleadings does not violate due\n\nprocess because it is not an absolute denial of parental rights. No. 07-14-00064-CV,\n\n2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 201, at *12\u201314 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Jan. 8, 2016, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). Although the Third Court has not precisely addressed this issue, it has generally\n\nrecognized that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate due process. Caldwell v.\n\nZimmerman, No. 03-18-00168-CV, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Mar. 27, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nAndrews argues that because attorneys have absolute immunity for actions\n\nundertaken while representing clients, parents appearing pro se should have similar\n\nimmunity when acting in their child\u2019s best interest. This argument fails for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the prefiling order does not prohibit Andrews from filing\u2014it requires her to obtain\n\npermission from the local administrative judge before filing new pleadings for affirmative\n\nrelief. Second, Andrews misunderstands attorney immunity. Attorney immunity protects\n\nagainst civil liability to third parties, not against court authority over attorneys. Bethel v.\n\nQuilling, Selander, Lownds, Winslett & Moser, P.C., 595 S.W.3d 651, 657 (Tex. 2020)\n\f(\u201cWe have long recognized . . . that attorney immunity is not boundless.\u201d). Courts retain\n\nfull authority to sanction, hold in contempt, or discipline attorneys for inappropriate\n\nconduct. Brewer v. Lennox Hearth Products, LLC, 601 S.W.3d 704, 718 (Tex. 2020) (\u201cA\n\ncourt\u2019s inherent authority includes the power to discipline an attorney\u2019s behavior.\u201d)\n\n(cleaned up).\n\nAndrews\u2019s first issue is overruled.\n\nFirst Amendment Right to Petition\n\nAndrews\u2019s entire second issue is stated as: \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the\n\nright to petition courts for redress (BE & K Construction Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516\n\n(2002)).\u201d This issue is insufficiently briefed. Nevertheless, the Third Court has previously\n\nheld that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate the First Amendment right to\n\npetition. Caldwell, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136.\n\nAndrews\u2019s second issue is overruled.\n\nStatutory Requirements\n\nBy her third issue, Andrews argues she is not a \u201cplaintiff\u201d under the statute and did\n\nnot file five frivolous cases in seven years. The statute defines \u201cplaintiff\u201d as \u201can individual\n\nwho commences or maintains a litigation pro se.\u201d TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 11.001(5) (emphasis added). Andrews meets both definitions: she commenced a\n\nmodification proceeding, and she maintained litigation through repeated motions to\n\nreconsider, stay enforcement, or declare orders void.\n\f Andrews\u2019s challenge is focused on only one basis for the vexatious litigant\n\nfinding\u2014five frivolous cases in seven years; she ignores the alternative basis that she\n\nrepeatedly attempted to relitigate matters finally determined against her. See id.\n\n\u00a7 11.054(1), (2). In her reply brief, Andrews summarily argues there was no competent\n\nevidence supporting this finding. However, arguments may not be raised for the first time\n\nin a reply brief. See McFadden v. Olesky, 517 S.W.3d 287, 293 n.3 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin\n\n2017, pet. denied).\n\nAndrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nInability to Pay\n\nBy her fourth issue, Andrews argues the trial court erred by denying her statement\n\nof inability to pay costs and failing to enter findings of fact. Andrews contends her affidavit\n\nconclusively established her inability to pay and was not contradicted by other evidence.\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 permits a party to file a sworn statement of\n\ninability to afford court costs. When the statement is contested, the trial court may require\n\nthe declarant to prove inability to pay at an evidentiary hearing with at least ten days of\n\nnotice. TEX. R. CIV. P. 145. At the hearing, \u201cthe burden is on the declarant to prove the\n\ninability to afford costs.\u201d Id.\n\nThe test for indigence is whether the record shows \u201cby a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the applicant would be unable to pay the costs . . . if [s]he really wanted to\n\nand made a good-faith effort to do so.\u201d Higgins v. Randall Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Off., 257 S.W.3d\n\n684, 686 (Tex. 2008) (cleaned up). We review for an abuse of discretion. Henderson v.\n\fArabzadegan, No. 03-24-00313-CV, 2024 Tex. App. LEXIS 5919, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Aug. 16, 2024, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nThe trial court provided Andrews with notice and asked her to bring documentation\n\nsupporting her indigency affidavit. Andrews refused to provide any documentation,\n\ninstead repeatedly asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction. Andrews\u2019s affidavit also\n\ncontained contradictory information: she claimed $0 monthly income and only $1,800 in\n\nassets while reporting $8,000 in monthly expenses. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in requiring Andrews to pay court costs.\n\nAndrews also complains the trial court failed to make findings of fact mandated by\n\nRule 145. See id. R. 145(f)(2). However, the trial court issued its findings seven days\n\nafter Andrews filed her brief, and she made no request to supplement her brief. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.7.\n\nAndrews also makes a conclusory argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling violates the\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. This argument consists of a\n\nsingle quote from a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Missing from the argument is any\n\nanalysis of how the trial court\u2019s ruling, or requiring her to pay court costs, violates her\n\nrights. Accordingly, this argument is waived for inadequate briefing. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex. 2018).\n\nAndrews\u2019s fourth issue is overruled.3\n\n3 In a fifth issue, Andrews challenges what she calls the trial court\u2019s \u201cflawed rulings.\u201d Her argument\ncontains no citations to the record, applicable law, or authority. Andrews fails to identify which specific\nruling she challenges, what relief she seeks, or how any relief could be granted. This issue is waived for\ninadequate briefing. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex.\n\f CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all of Andrews\u2019s issues, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n2018) (\u201cA brief must provide citations or argument and analysis for the contentions and failure to do this\ncan result in waiver.\u201d).\n\n8"

Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from a final order in a suit affecting the parent-\n\nchild relationship regarding her child, E.K.D., with Appellee Nicholas Denbrock. Andrews\n\nraises three issues: (1) the trial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised\n\nvisitation; (2) the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption favoring a standard\n\npossession order; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in determining her net\n\nresources for child support were subject to the maximum amount. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case began with two registered foreign orders from Nevada that gave the\n\nparties \u201cjoint legal custody,\u201d a week-on/week-off possession schedule, and a mutual\n\nbehavior order. Denbrock filed suit to modify the Nevada order in Texas, requesting that\n\nhe have the exclusive right to designate the child\u2019s residence and to make all medical and\n\neducational decisions concerning the child. Andrews counterpetitioned for similar relief.\n\nThe matter was tried to the bench over four trial days across six months. The trial\n\ncourt appointed both parties as joint managing conservators but awarded Denbrock\n\nexclusive rights including the right to designate the child\u2019s residence. Andrews received\n\nonly supervised visitation and was ordered to pay $1,500 monthly in child support.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPossession and Access\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s supervised visitation order in her first two\n\nissues. We review a trial court\u2019s modification of conservatorship or possession for an\n\nabuse of discretion. In re J.A.J., 243 S.W.3d 611, 616 (Tex. 2007). \u201cThe best interest of\n\nthe child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues\n\nof conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d\n\n211, 218 (Tex. 2021) (quoting TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.002). Conservatorship suits\n\nare \u201cintensely fact driven.\u201d Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 19 (Tex. 2002). For this reason,\n\n\u201cthe trial court is in the best position to \u2018observe the demeanor and personalities of the\n\nwitnesses and can \u201cfeel\u201d the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by\n\nmerely reading the record.\u2019\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting Echols v. Olivarez,\n\f85 S.W.3d 475, 477 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2002, no pet.)). The factfinder \u201cis the sole judge\n\nof the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d Golden Eagle\n\nArchery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion by acting \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principles\u201d or arbitrarily or unreasonably. In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting\n\nWorford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam)). A trial court also\n\nabuses its discretion \u201cif it imposes restrictions that exceed those required to protect the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest.\u201d In re H.D.C., 474 S.W.3d 758, 764 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2014, no pet.); see also In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218\u201319.\n\nUnder this standard, challenges to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nare not independent grounds of error but instead are factors used to assess whether the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion. Zeifman v. Michels, 212 S.W.3d 582, 587 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin 2006, pet. denied). An appellate court considers (1) whether the trial court had\n\nsufficient information on which to exercise its discretion and (2) whether the trial court\n\nerred in its application of discretion. Id. at 588. A trial court does not abuse its discretion\n\nif there is some substantive, probative evidence to support its decision. Id. at 587.\n\nAndrews argues that under the Holley and Family Code\u2019s best-interest factors, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised visits. She also challenges the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a standard possession\n\norder. See Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976);2 TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.\n\n2 The Holley factors include: (1) the desires of the child; (2) the emotional and physical needs of\n\nthe child now and in the future; (3) the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future;\n(4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (5) the programs available to assist these\nindividuals to promote the best interest of the child; (6) the plans for the child by the individuals seeking\n\f\u00a7 153.134(a).3 Andrews contends the trial court based its ruling on a \u201cmere failure to\n\nfollow a court order\u201d rather than the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe trial court found Andrews violated court orders approximately two dozen times.\n\nSome violations were relatively minor, such as failing to provide her new address in a\n\ntimely manner. Other violations were more significant, including going out of state,\n\nrefusing to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s periods of possession, and making\n\ndemeaning remarks about Denbrock during electronic communications with the child.\n\nThe trial court also found that Andrews had refused to identify herself at a hearing and\n\nsent ex parte communications to the trial court through social media. Additionally,\n\nAndrews tried to remove the child from Denbrock\u2019s car without permission during what\n\nwas supposed to be supervised visitation. Andrews does not challenge any of these\n\nfindings, and the evidence supports them.\n\nAdditional evidence at trial included various filings by Andrews, including a \u201cWrit of\n\nDivinia,\u201d and a notice that Andrews placed the child into a trust. Andrews testified she\n\ncustody; (7) the stability of the home or proposed placement; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent which\nmay indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and (9) any excuse for the acts\nor omissions of the parent. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976).\n 3 The statutory best-interest factors include:\n\n(1) whether the physical, psychological, or emotional needs and development of the child\n will benefit from the appointment of joint managing conservators; (2) the ability of the\n parents to give first priority to the welfare of the child and reach shared decisions in the\n child\u2019s best interest; (3) whether each parent can encourage and accept a positive\n relationship between the child and the other parent; (4) whether both parents participated\n in child rearing before the filing of the suit; (5) the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019\n residences; (6) if the child is 12 years of age or older, the child\u2019s preference, if any,\n regarding the person to have the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the\n child; and (7) any other relevant factor.\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a).\n\fagrees to follow court orders \u201cwhen it\u2019s in the best interest of [the child].\u201d She indicated\n\nthat she believed the original Nevada order violated due process and was illegal, which\n\nis why she did not believe she needed to follow it.\n\nThe Holley and statutory best-interest factors are neither exhaustive nor\n\ndeterminative. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a)(7) (permitting a trial court to\n\nconsider any other relevant factors); In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 27 (Tex. 2002) (the Holley\n\nfactors are not exhaustive and some cases may not have evidence of some factors at\n\nall). Courts have considered a parent\u2019s conduct that interferes with the other parent\u2019s\n\nrelationship with their child. See Allen v. Allen, 475 S.W.3d 453, 458 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.); In re Marriage of Chandler, 914 S.W.2d 252, 255 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAmarillo 1996, no writ).\n\nThe record contains significant testimony and evidence that Andrews interfered\n\nwith Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child. The evidence reveals that Andrews:\n\n\u2022 Sometimes refused to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s\n scheduled possession periods;\n\n\u2022 Made negative comments about Denbrock to the child and called\n Denbrock and his family \u201cdemons,\u201d \u201cpsychos,\u201d and \u201cevil monkeys\u201d;\n\n\u2022 Exhibited suicidal ideation and paranoid beliefs about being followed\n and monitored;\n\n\u2022 Engaged in \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d by seeking treatment from multiple\n physicians until receiving preferred responses, often without\n consulting Denbrock;\n\n\u2022 After temporary orders gave Denbrock medical decision-making\n authority, cancelled the child\u2019s four-year check-up and dental\n appointments; and\n\f \u2022 Attempted to open Denbrock\u2019s car doors to obtain the child when no\n supervisor was present, which severely upset the child.\n\nAlthough some of the Holley and statutory best-interest factors could have\n\nsupported a different outcome, that does not mean that the trial court\u2019s order constitutes\n\nan abuse of discretion. The trial court considered Andrews\u2019s extensive history of\n\ninterfering with Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child, as well as his efforts to obtain\n\nproper healthcare for the child, and Andrews\u2019s position regarding following court orders\n\nthat she deems not to be in the child\u2019s best interest. On this record, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by limiting Andrews\u2019s periods of possession and\n\naccess and requiring them to be supervised. Andrews\u2019s first and second issues are\n\noverruled.\n\nChild Support\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that her net monthly resources\n\nwere $9,200\u2014the statutory maximum\u2014resulting in a $1,500 monthly support obligation.\n\nChild support determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, with legal\n\nand factual sufficiency serving as relevant factors rather than independent grounds for\n\nreversal. Banakar v. Krause, 674 S.W.3d 564, 573 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2023,\n\nno pet.). Net resources include income from various sources, including trust income and\n\n\u201call other income actually received.\u201d TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 154.062(b). Trial courts may\n\ncalculate net resources based on imprecise information, particularly when a party fails to\n\nprovide required documentation. In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d 660, 666 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso\n\n2011, no pet.).\n\f Andrews challenges the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that she made\n\n$20,000 in monthly income. Andrews testified that she receives income from her father\u2019s\n\nbusiness that takes in $20,000 to $30,000 monthly, though she claimed her father pays\n\nher only $2,000 to $4,000 monthly \u201cfor the extra stuff.\u201d Notably, though, Andrews refused\n\nto provide trust documents, bank records, or other financial information despite discovery\n\nrequests and a court order compelling production.\n\nHowever, the trial court could also assess Andrews\u2019s credibility regarding her\n\nincome through the other evidence of her expenses: she reported approximately $7,000\n\nin monthly expenses for rent, car payments, and therapy alone\u2014well beyond the $2,000\n\nto $4,000 she claimed to receive. The trial court was free to disbelieve Andrews\u2019s\n\ntestimony regarding her income. See In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d at 666. Moreover, any error\n\nthat the trial court could have made would be the fault of Andrews by contumaciously\n\nrefusing to provide the necessary information to appropriately set child support, despite\n\ndiscovery requests and an order to compel. Accordingly, we conclude that there was at\n\nleast some evidence of a probative and substantive character supporting the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision and determine that the trial court made a reasonable decision based on that\n\nevidence. See Banakar, 674 S.W.3d at 573. Andrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n7"

See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\n2 TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1),(b)(2)(A), (B). Appellant pleaded true to the enhancement\n\nand habitual offender provisions. The range of punishment applicable to Appellant was enhanced to a term\nof confinement of \u201clife, or for any term of not more than 99 years or less than 25 years.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE\nANN. \u00a7 12.42(d).\n\fjury assessed a punishment of 40 years of confinement for each conviction. The trial\n\ncourt sentenced Appellant accordingly and ordered the sentences run concurrently. We\n\noverrule Appellant\u2019s two issues and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAppellant and the complainant, Marisa Espinoza, had been in an on-and-off\n\nromantic relationship since 1996. They have two children together, ages 29 and 11.\n\nEspinoza testified they had conducted a marriage ceremony but never filed official\n\npaperwork, and she would introduce Appellant as both her boyfriend or husband. At the\n\ntime of the charged offense, Appellant had been living with Espinoza for about eight\n\nmonths after being released from custody in January 2022.\n\nOn September 9, 2022, Appellant and Espinoza had been arguing all day. The\n\nargument intensified after Appellant took Espinoza\u2019s truck and was gone longer than\n\nexpected, which angered Espinoza. She began \u201cblowing up his phone\u201d;3 he would not\n\nanswer her calls. When Appellant returned, the discussion escalated, with Appellant\n\ncalling Espinoza names and then engaging in physical violence.\n\nAppellant grabbed Espinoza by her hair and pulled her inside the house. Once\n\ninside the kitchen and dining room area, Appellant struck her in the face and head area\n\nwith his hands. Espinoza testified he hit her \u201cat least three times\u201d with a closed fist.\n\nAppellant also grabbed Espinoza by the throat with his left hand, applying pressure with\n\na force that caused her to feel she \u201cwas being suffocated. Like . . . they\u2019re cutting off your\n\n3 This is a colloquial expression meaning repeatedly calling or texting someone, often in an urgent\n\nor persistent manner. See, e.g., K\u2019ron, Round of Applause, (Atlantic Records 2020). (\u201cShe blowin\u2019 up my\nphone / Won\u2019t leave me alone / She get on my nerves / Where would I be without her?\u201d).\n\fairway.\u201d Meanwhile, Appellant told Espinoza \u201che hates [her], he\u2019s going to kill [her], stuff\n\nlike that.\u201d Espinoza had difficulty breathing, was \u201cscared,\u201d and needed \u201cto get help.\u201d\n\nWhen Espinoza\u2019s brother walked into the room, Appellant released his grip.\n\nEspinoza immediately ran to the front door and called 911. Espinoza\u2019s voice was\n\nnoticeably raspy as she tried to catch her breath. Police officers responding to the scene\n\nobserved visible injuries on Espinoza\u2019s neck, photographed the injuries, and arrested\n\nAppellant for assault by strangulation.\n\nTwo days later, Appellant telephoned Espinoza from jail and told her to instruct\n\nprosecutors to drop the charges. During this call, he admitted he grabbed her by the\n\n\u201cpescuezo,\u201d the Spanish word for \u201cneck.\u201d\n\nANALYSIS\n\nFirst Issue: Double Jeopardy\n\nAppellant argues his convictions for both assault family violence by occlusion and\n\nassault family violence with a prior conviction constitute multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. He\n\nacknowledges the remedy for the alleged violation would be to \u201cretain the conviction with\n\nthe most serious punishment and vacate any remaining convictions\u201d that violate double\n\njeopardy. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent 40-year terms of imprisonment for both\n\nconvictions.\n\f(a) Preservation of Error\n\nThe State argues Appellant failed to preserve this issue. But a double-jeopardy\n\nclaim may be raised for the first time on appeal when (1) the undisputed facts show the\n\nviolation is clearly apparent on the record\u2019s face, and (2) enforcement of procedural\n\ndefault serves no legitimate state interest. Langs v. State, 183 S.W.3d 680, 687 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2006).\n\nWe hold these conditions are met. A claim is apparent on the face of the record if\n\nits resolution does not require additional proceedings to introduce more evidence. Ex\n\nparte Denton, 399 S.W.3d 540, 544 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy\n\nclaim does not require additional proceedings. Moreover, the State presents no\n\npersuasive argument why enforcing procedural default serves any legitimate state\n\ninterest under these circumstances. See Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889, 892 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d); Anderson v. State, No. 10-01-00306-CV, 2003 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 6008, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco July 2, 2003, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n(b) Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\nBrown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977); Ramos v. State, 636 S.W.3d 646, 651 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021). Multiple-punishment violations occur when the same conduct is\n\npunished under distinct statutes where the Legislature intended punishment only once.\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nHere, Appellant contends that the Legislature intended only one punishment,\n\narguing section 22.01(a) is the lesser-included offense of section 22.01(b)(2)(B)\n\f(impeding normal breathing or circulation), which is merely an enhancement of the same\n\ncriminal conduct. \u201cA multiple-punishments violation can arise either in the context of\n\nlesser-included offenses, where the same conduct is punished under a greater and a\n\nlesser-included offense, and when the same conduct is punished under two distinct\n\nstatutes where the Legislature only intended for the conduct to be punished once.\u201d\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nAccordingly, we look to the statute\u2019s text to determine legislative intent. Stevenson,\n\n499 S.W.3d at 850. It is undisputed that occlusion assault (Count I) and assault family\n\nviolence with a prior (Count II) have different elements and that the State proved these\n\nelements at trial. Occlusion assault requires the State prove that a defendant impeded\n\nthe normal breathing or blood circulation of the complainant, while this element is not\n\nrequired for assault family violence with a prior conviction.\n\nThis distinction is of critical importance. In Ortiz v. State, 623 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021), the Court of Criminal Appeals addressed whether bodily-injury assault\n\ncan be a lesser-included offense of occlusion assault and answered \u201cNo.\u201d The Court\n\nemployed an \u201callowable unit of prosecution\u201d analysis to examine what facts are required\n\nto prove each offense. Occlusion assault requires proof of a specific injury\u2014\u201cimpeding\n\nnormal breathing or circulation of the blood\u201d\u2014whereas simple assault requires proof of\n\nany \u201cbodily injury,\u201d broadly defined as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical\n\ncondition.\u201d Id. at 806\u201307. While impeding breathing constitutes bodily injury, it is a distinct\n\ntype that excludes other injuries. The Court illustrated this principle with an analogy:\n\nImpeding is exclusive of other injuries in the same way that a square is\n exclusive of other rectangles: A square is a rectangle, but other rectangles\n\f are not squares; specifying \u201csquare\u201d excludes non-square rectangles; and\n specifying \u201cimpeding\u201d excludes non-impeding injuries.\n\nFor example, if a defendant were charged with occlusion assault, and the\n evidence showed that he stomped on the complainant\u2019s foot and caused\n pain, that assault would not be included in the charged offense because a\n non-impeding injury is not required to prove occlusion assault.\n\nId. at 807. The Court explained that even a non-impeding injury inflicted on the neck\n\nwould not be proven by the same facts needed to prove occlusion assault. If pinching the\n\nneck caused pain but did not impede normal breathing or blood circulation, the assault\n\nwould not be included because the assault by pinching would require proof of a different\n\ninjury than impeding.\n\nThe facts in this appeal are very similar to those in Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Brown involved a defendant who committed both\n\nstrangulation and other assaultive acts against his intimate partner during the same\n\nepisode. The defendant was convicted of both occlusion assault of a household/family\n\nmember and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe Tenth Court of Appeals relied on Ortiz\u2019s methodology to hold that convictions\n\nfor both offenses from the same incident did not violate double jeopardy. Using unit-of-\n\nprosecution analysis, the court determined that both result-oriented offenses have distinct\n\ngravamina: impeding is the focus of occlusion assault and defines its allowable unit of\n\nprosecution while excluding other injuries, whereas bodily-injury assault lacks a statutorily\n\nspecified injury. Id. at 893. The court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in\n\noccluding the complainant\u2019s breathing or blood circulation were separate from other\n\nassaultive acts he committed against her . . . [even] [t]hough the offenses may have\n\foccurred during the same criminal episode . . . .\u201d Id. at 894. Therefore, the court reasoned\n\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. Id. at 893\u201394.\n\nAppellant argues that Brown\u2019s \u201cconclusions are incorrect and both offenses are\n\nsubject to double jeopardy protection.\u201d But as a transferee court from the Tenth Court of\n\nAppeals, we are required to follow Brown\u2019s holding, as that constitutes binding precedent\n\non that court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3; Baker v. State, No. 07-22-00286-CR, 2023 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 5857, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Aug. 7, 2023, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cTexas courts follow\n\nvertical stare decisis (lower courts must follow the precedents of all higher courts) and\n\nhorizontal stare decisis (three-judge panels must follow materially indistinguishable\n\ndecisions of earlier panels of the same court unless a higher authority has superseded\n\nthat prior decision).\u201d Earl v. State, No. 03-23-00427-CR, 2025 Tex. App. LEXIS 4527, at\n\n*9\u201310 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin June 27, 2025, no pet. h.) (citing Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645\n\nS.W.3d 251, 256 (Tex. 2022)).\n\n(c) Application to this Case\n\nThese binding decisions establish a clear rule: Espinoza\u2019s injury from occlusion\n\nassault was not merely different in degree from other assault injuries she received\u2014it\n\nwas different in kind. Ortiz, 623 S.W.3d at 809; see also McCall v. State, 635 S.W.3d 261,\n\n268 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Though Appellant\u2019s offenses occurred during\n\nthe same criminal episode, they are not the same offense for Double Jeopardy purposes\n\nbecause they involve different statutorily-specified injuries requiring proof of different\n\nfacts. Brown, 640 S.W.3d at 894.\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\fSecond Issue: Evidence of Prior Domestic Violence\n\nIn his second issue, Appellant argues the trial court erred by permitting Espinoza\n\nto testify about prior instances of domestic violence between her and Appellant.\n\nTo preserve error regarding evidence admission, a party must object each time\n\ninadmissible evidence is offered, obtain a running objection, or request a hearing outside\n\nthe jury\u2019s presence. Martinez v. State, 98 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); see\n\nalso TEX. R. EVID. 103(b). Here, Appellant voiced a relevance objection when the State\n\nbegan examining Espinoza about past domestic violence episodes, which the trial court\n\noverruled. He did not reurge that objection or request a running objection thereafter.\n\nAdditional evidence of the 2014 judgment documenting Appellant\u2019s guilty plea for assault\n\nfamily violence was admitted without objection. Espinoza also testified without objection\n\nthat she was the victim of that assault and that Appellant routinely asked her to drop\n\ncharges after other past incidents.\n\nMoreover, significant evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt was admitted beyond the prior\n\nviolence testimony. The jury also heard Appellant\u2019s recorded jail call admitting he grabbed\n\nher neck and related testimony.4 It heard Espinoza\u2019s raspy voice on her 911 call.\n\nEspinoza described how Appellant pushed her down, hit her, and grabbed her throat, and\n\nshowed the jury photographic evidence of her injuries.\n\nBecause Appellant did not continue objecting, request a running objection, or seek\n\na hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence, any error was not preserved. See, e.g., Ethington\n\n4 Without objection, Detective Erin McCullough testified that Appellant told Espinoza on the jail call:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really strangle you, I just put my hands around your neck.\u201d McCullough also testified about studies\nshowing strangulation victims are seven times more likely to be murdered by their abuser.\n\fv. State, 819 S.W.2d 854, 859\u201360 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991); Sanchez v. State, 595 S.W.3d\n\n331, 337\u201338 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, no pet.).\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled Appellant\u2019s two issues, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\nDo not publish.\n\n9"

Id. \u00b6 13. The emails\n\nshowed the \u201cnames, email addresses, and sometimes telephone numbers\u201d of the ATF agents, FBI\n\nagents, and staff involved. Id. \u00b6 15. Most of the emails also included \u201cthe underlying investigative\n\ntarget\u2019s name\u201d and discussion of the investigation. Id. \u00b6 15. And each monitoring request also\n\nincluded a \u201cstandard form\u201d regarding the individual, or \u201csubject,\u201d for whom monitoring was\n\nrequested. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. The forms enabled the requesters to input the following categories of\n\ninformation:\n\n\u2022 Submit date\n \u2022 Requester\u2019s name, contact number, and e-mail address\n \u2022 Case number\n \u2022 Subject\u2019s name, date of birth, gender, race, social security number, state\n of residence, and place of birth\n \u2022 FBI number\n \u2022 State record number\n \u2022 Monitoring time frame\n \u2022 Suspected violation(s) of the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act\n \u2022 Detailed information about why the subject is under investigation\n\f \u2022 Detailed information about the investigation. What does the requester\n know and how do they know it?\n\nId. \u00b6 15. The last two bullet points on the form calling for \u201cdetailed information\u201d allow the\n\nrequester to provide \u201cnarrative responses,\u201d and some of the responses in the produced documents\n\nincluded: \u201cinformation furnished by witnesses or confidential sources,\u201d id. \u00b6 15; information from\n\nthe agency\u2019s \u201cFirearms Tracing System\u201d database, id. \u00b6 19; and information about the \u201cspecific\n\nlaw enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the investigation. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn advance of the production, ATF marked multiple pieces of information for redaction\n\npursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Barnett Decl. \u00b6 16. Under Exemption\n\n3, it marked for redaction the \u201crecords of specific firearms traces\u201d from the Firearms Tracing\n\nSystem database. Id. \u00b6 19. Under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), it marked for redaction the\n\n\u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d of ATF agents, FBI agents, agency personnel, and the\n\nsubjects, associates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nFinally, under Exemption 7(E), it marked for redaction information revealing \u201cspecific law\n\nenforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure utilized in the previous productions, ATF marked the\n\nrecords to be included in the thirteenth production with \u201cred boxes\u201d outlining the information it\n\nintended to redact. Id. \u00b6 7. The material in each red box was overlaid with text indicating the\n\napplicable FOIA exemption. Id. The procedure to be followed required the processor to select\n\n\u201cApply\u201d to create a new, redacted document. Id. Although the separate, redacted document was\n\ncreated for the thirteenth production, the agency inadvertently emailed plaintiffs a copy of the\n\nprevious version that still showed red boxes outlining the redactions and the contents of the boxes,\n\nnot the version that actually applied the redactions. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7\u20138.\n\f On September 8, 2023, two days after the agency released the thirteenth production,\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked ATF\u2019s counsel in an email, \u201c[c]an I get a redacted version of the final\n\nProduction #13?\u201d Attachment B to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] (emphasis in original). Fifteen\n\nminutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cIt seems there was an inadvertent production. Would\n\nyou please delete any copy that you may have downloaded? ATF will send you a replacement\n\nproduction.\u201d Attachment C to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. Nine minutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel sent\n\n\u201cthe proper version of production 13,\u201d containing the permanently applied redactions. Attachment\n\nD to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3].\n\nOn September 10, ATF\u2019s counsel asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to \u201cconfirm in writing that [he]\n\ndeleted any copy of the inadvertent production,\u201d noting the \u201csignificant privacy interests in the\n\nmaterial[.]\u201d Attachment E to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. The next day, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n\nresponded tartly: \u201cI do not have time today to consider much less respond to this request to delete\n\nwhat I was sent.\u201d Attachment F to Barnett Decl. [Dkt # 32-3] at 1. ATF\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cif you\n\ndo not confirm deletion of the materials, ATF plans to move for a protective order.\u201d Id.\n\nThe next day, a different attorney emailed ATF\u2019s counsel to say that he would \u201cbe\n\nrepresenting\u201d plaintiffs with respect to the \u201cplanned motion for protective order.\u201d Attachment H\n\nto Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] at 1. At that point, plaintiffs had both the redacted version and the\n\ninadvertently unredacted version of the thirteenth production in its possession, and one could easily\n\nascertain whether anything had been omitted that did not fall within a FOIA exemption. Yet\n\ncounsel took the following position:\n\n[O]ur review of these documents demonstrates that they may, like other\n documents received in this FOIA, and perhaps to a greater extent, reveal\n unauthorized or even illegal activity by ATF and the FBI, violating statutory\n requirements and jeopardizing the constitutional rights of federal firearms\n licensees and other Americans. Thus, we are concerned that, if we agree to\n your proposal and destroy the documents in our possession, those\n\f unauthorized or even illegal activities will be covered up by ATF. We do\n not agree voluntarily to be complicit in such a coverup. You have asked for\n our position on a protective order. We oppose . . . . [T]he error here is the\n government\u2019s alone, and we will resist any effort to make it appear that we\n have done anything wrong, or that ATF is somehow the \u201cgood guy\u201d here\n by, under the guise of protecting certain private information that it\n negligently disclosed, attempting to coverup its potential violations of\n statutes and constitutional rights.\n\nId. at 2.\n\nOn September 13, ATF moved for a protective order to shield the \u201cmaterial inadvertently\n\nproduced\u201d from dissemination, disclosure, or use until the Court decided the merits of its FOIA\n\nexemptions. Def.\u2019s Expedited Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 20] at 1, 7\u20138. Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe motion. See Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 28] (\u201cPls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective\n\nOrder\u201d). The Court granted the motion, and it ordered plaintiffs to \u201ctemporarily sequester\u201d the\n\ninadvertently produced file until a decision regarding the redactions could be made on the merits.\n\nTPO at 1.1 Defendant moved for summary judgment on December 8, and the parties fully briefed\n\nthe motion. See Def.\u2019s Mot.; Pls.\u2019 Resp.; Def.\u2019s Reply.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, ATF filed a notice of supplemental authority pointing to the D.C.\n\nCircuit\u2019s decision in Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police, 126 F.4th 708\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2025), and the parties were directed to file submissions addressing its impact on the\n\ndispute. See Def.\u2019s Notice of Suppl.

Plaintiffs also moved to lift the Court\u2019s\n\nprotective order in light of the Circuit\u2019s ruling. See Pls.\u2019 Mot. That motion is also fully briefed.\n\nSee Def.\u2019s Opp.; Pls.\u2019 Reply. The Court then ordered ATF to submit the unredacted thirteenth\n\n1 The order did not limit plaintiffs\u2019 use of the version of the thirteenth production with the\nredactions properly applied.\n\fproduction to the Court for in camera review, see Minute Order (Apr. 11, 2025), and ATF\n\nsubmitted the materials under seal. See Sealed Doc. [Dkt. # 41].\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\n\nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat summary\n\njudgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue for trial.\u201d Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if a\n\nreasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it is capable\n\nof affecting the outcome of the litigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236,\n\n1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In assessing a party\u2019s motion, the court must \u201cview the facts and draw\n\nreasonable inferences \u2018in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment\n\nmotion.\u2019\u201d Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States\n\nv. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWhen a federal agency receives a request for records under the Freedom of Information\n\nAct, the statute requires it to disclose the requested information unless it falls into one of FOIA\u2019s\n\fnine exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(3)(A), (b)(1)\u2013(9). In a \u201ctypical FOIA case concerning the\n\nwithholding of requested documents,\u201d the court decides \u201cthe applicability of a claimed FOIA\n\nexemption,\u201d Al-Fayed v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 254 F.3d 300, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and if it\n\ndetermines that the information does not fall within the exemption, the requester is entitled to it.\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\n\nThis is not the typical case. During the process of responding to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request,\n\nthe agency inadvertently produced a set of documents that were marked for redaction, but not\n\nactually redacted. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 7. The agency maintains in its motion for summary judgment\n\nthat all of the information designated for redaction falls within Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and\n\n7(E), Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315, and plaintiffs do not dispute that assertion. Plaintiffs \u201ctake no position\u201d\n\non the FOIA exemptions; indeed, they announce that they \u201chave no interest in the vast majority of\n\nthe . . . information ATF disclosed.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. In other words, plaintiffs do not claim that\n\nthey are entitled to any of the information the agency meant to withhold, and having seen it, they\n\nare not suggesting that they have any reason to disseminate the bulk of it further. Nonetheless,\n\nthey object to any order extending restrictions on the use of the material on principle.\n\nThe agency asks the Court to order plaintiffs to: (1) \u201csequester the September 6, 2023,\n\ninadvertently produced FOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate,\n\ndisclose, or use for any purpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent opinion in Human Rights Defense Center v. United\n\nStates Park Police bars the Court from ordering that relief and requires it to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order. See Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem.; Pls.\u2019 Mot. They also contend that an order sequestering\n\nthe inadvertent production would constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 27\u201332.\n\f The Court finds that defendant\u2019s motion and supporting declaration and its own review of\n\nthe materials in camera confirm that all the information marked for redaction in the inadvertent\n\nproduction falls properly within a FOIA exemption. Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment in its favor will be granted on the propriety of the exemptions. This also means that the\n\nCourt\u2019s interim order restricting the use of the information that defendant meant to redact until the\n\nlegitimacy of the redactions had been determined expires under its own terms, TPO at 1,2 and that\n\nthe challenge to that order is now moot.\n\nThe Court also finds that it has equitable authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested relief to bar\n\nplaintiffs from using or disseminating the inadvertently produced information. Plaintiffs have\n\nalready agreed to destroy the majority of the information at issue, which is properly exempt under\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D). Pls.\u2019 Reply at 23. As for the rest of the information, Human Rights\n\nDefense Center v. United States Park Police is distinguishable and does not control the instant\n\nsuit, and both Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent regarding the Court\u2019s equitable authority\n\nunder FOIA support a remedy that bars the use of FOIA-exempted information.\n\nI. All of the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n exemptions claimed by the ATF.\n\nThe ATF marked several sets of information for redaction in the thirteenth production, and\n\nits motion for summary judgment argues that those redactions were proper under FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315. Plaintiffs have \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated\n\n2 Plaintiffs argued that the Court lacked authority to let the temporary protective order stand.\nSee Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem. at 2\u20135.\n\fthat they \u201cdo not challenge\u201d the \u201clegality\u201d of the redactions, Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 5\u20136,3 and indeed, their\n\nopposition does not argue against any of the exemptions that ATF claimed. Id. at 6\u201333; see id. at\n\n6 (\u201cATF spends the majority of its briefing arguing that various redactions . . . would have been\n\nappropriate under various FOIA exemptions . . . . Plaintiffs take no position with respect to these\n\narguments.\u201d).\n\nAlthough plaintiffs make no effort to challenge the agency\u2019s FOIA exemptions, \u201c[u]nder\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion for summary judgment cannot be \u2018conceded\u2019 for\n\nwant of opposition.\u201d Winston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\n\u201cThe burden is always on the movant to demonstrate why summary judgment is warranted,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[t]he nonmoving party\u2019s failure to oppose summary judgment does not shift that burden.\u201d Id.,\n\nquoting Grimes v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 83, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Therefore, the Court\n\nmust still determine whether the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n\nexemptions claimed, even though plaintiffs do not contest the exemptions.\n\nThe Court has reviewed the agency\u2019s declaration in support of its motion, as well as the\n\nunredacted version of the thirteenth production in camera, and it concludes that all of the\n\ninformation ATF marked for redaction was properly exempt under FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C),\n\n7(D), and 7(E).\n\n3 See also Joint Status Report [Dkt. # 31] at 2 (\u201cPlaintiffs do not intend to challenge the\nFOIA redactions that could have been claimed, but were not made, on Production 13.\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Resp.\nat 1 n.1 (explaining that plaintiffs \u201cstyle[d]\u201d their opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment as a \u201cResponse\u201d rather than an \u201cOpposition\u201d because \u201cthe only disputed issue between\nthe parties is Defendant\u2019s motion for a permanent protective order . . . not summary judgment\u201d);\nPls.\u2019 Resp. to Def.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Fact [Dkt. # 33-1] at 1 (\u201cPlaintiffs generally\ndo not contest ATF\u2019s Statement of Material Facts . . . .\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Suppl.

Defendant can invoke all the FOIA exemptions it wants.\u201d).\n\f A. Exemption 3\n\nExemption 3 authorizes agencies to withhold information that is \u201cspecifically exempted\n\nfrom disclosure by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The statute must either: (1) \u201crequire[] that the\n\nmatters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,\u201d or\n\n(2) \u201cestablish[] particular criteria for withholding or refer[] to particular types of matters to be\n\nwithheld.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(A)(i)\u2013(ii). And if the statute was \u201cenacted after the date of enactment\n\nof the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\u201d it must \u201cspecifically cite[] to\u201d FOIA. Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(B). To\n\njustify its withholding, the agency \u201cneed only show that the statute claimed is one of exemption as\n\ncontemplated by Exemption 3 and that the withheld material falls within the statute.\u201d Larson v.\n\nDep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\nATF invoked Exemption 3 to withhold information regarding \u201cspecific firearms traces\u201d\n\nderived from ATF\u2019s Firearms Tracing System (\u201cFTS\u201d) database, most of which appears in the\n\nNICS monitoring request forms to explain \u201cwhy [ATF\u2019s] subject [was] under investigation.\u201d\n\nBarnett Decl. \u00b6 19. The agency asserts that the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552 (2011) (\u201cthe Act of 2012\u201d), bars it\n\nfrom disclosing the contents of the Firearms Tracing System. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5.\n\nCongress restricted the ATF\u2019s ability to disclose firearms tracing information in 2003,\n\nwhen it passed the Tiahrt Amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003,\n\nPub. L. No. 108-7, 117 Stat. 11 (2003). See id. \u00a7 644 (\u201cNo funds appropriated under this\n\nAct . . . shall be available to take any action based upon any provision of [FOIA] with respect to\n\nrecords collected or maintained . . . in connection with . . . the tracing of a firearm[.]\u201d); Barnett\n\nDecl. \u00b6 18. Iterations of this restriction have appeared in most, if not all, of the consolidated\n\fappropriations acts since 2003,4 until its most recent version in the Act of 2012. The current Act\n\nrequires:\n\nThat, during the current fiscal year and in each fiscal year thereafter, no\n funds appropriated under this or any other Act may be used to disclose part\n or all of the contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by\n the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\n Explosives . . . pursuant to section 923(g) of title 18, United States Code, or\n required to be reported pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (7) of such section,\n except to: (1) a Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement agency, or a\n Federal, State, or local prosecutor; or (2) a foreign law enforcement agency\n solely in connection with or for use in a criminal investigation or\n prosecution; or (3) a Federal agency for a national security or intelligence\n purpose; . . . and no person or entity described in (1), (2) or (3) shall\n knowingly and publicly disclose such data; and all such data shall be\n immune from legal process, shall not be subject to subpoena or other\n discovery, shall be inadmissible in evidence, and shall not be used, relied\n on, or disclosed in any manner, nor shall testimony or other evidence be\n permitted based on the data, in a civil action in any State (including the\n District of Columbia) or Federal court or in an administrative proceeding\n other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n Firearms and Explosives to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of such\n title, or a review of such an action or proceeding . . . .\n\nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat.\n\n552, 609\u2013610.\n\nBased on this language, most courts in this district have held that the government may\n\nwithhold trace information from the Firearms Trace System under Exemption 3. See, e.g.,\n\nAbdeljabbar v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 74 F. Supp. 3d 158, 172\u201377\n\n4 See Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives,\n\n67 F. Supp. 3d. 290, 300\u201301 (D.D.C. 2014), the Court is persuaded by the reasoning in Abdeljabbar\n\nthat:\n\n[T]he disclosure prohibitions set forth by Congress in the 2005 and 2008\n appropriations bills are still effective prospectively and beyond those fiscal\n years as a permanent prohibition, until such time as Congress expresses the\n intent to repeal or modify them. . . . Congress\u2019s uninterrupted use of this\n language in appropriations bills after 2009 supports the conclusion that\n Congress did not intend for the judiciary to depart from this long-standing\n position.\n\n74 F. Supp. 3d at 175\u201376. For their part, plaintiffs offer no reason as to why the Court should\n\ncome to a contrary conclusion; they do not argue against the agency\u2019s application of Exemption 3\n\nat all.\n\nThe Court has observed the information at issue and confirmed that it contains the firearms\n\ntracing information that the ATF is barred from publicly releasing. Therefore, the Court finds that\n\nthe agency\u2019s invocation of Exemption 3 is proper.\n\nB. Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D)\n\nATF invoked Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D) for the bulk of the information it marked for\n\nredaction: the personal information of ATF and FBI agents, agency personnel, and the subjects,\n\nassociates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Barnett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) serve similar goals. Exemption 6 shields any \u201cpersonnel and\n\nmedical files and similar files\u201d where \u201cdisclosure . . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\finvasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). The exemption is \u201cconstrued broadly to\n\ncover essentially all information sought from Government records that \u2018appl[y] to a particular\n\nindividual,\u2019\u201d Pinson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 202 F. Supp. 3d 86, 99 (D.D.C. 2016), quoting U.S.\n\nDep\u2019t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982), including \u201cpersonal information, such\n\nas names and addresses.\u201d Prison Legal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015),\n\nquoting Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Similarly,\n\nExemption 7(C) protects from disclosure information in law enforcement records that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(c).\n\nAlthough the application of both exemptions \u201cturns on a balance of the individual\u2019s right\n\nof privacy against the basic policy of opening agency action to the light of public scrutiny,\u201d CEI\n\nWash. Bureau, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 469 F.3d 126, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2006), (citation omitted),\n\nthe D.C. Circuit has held that Exemption 7(C) \u201cestablishes a lower bar for withholding material\u201d\n\nthan Exemption 6. Am. C.L. Union v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations\n\nomitted). So \u201cwhen an agency seeks to withhold records \u2018compiled for law enforcement purposes\u2019\n\nas implicating personal privacy, only Exemption 7(C) need be considered, since \u2018all information\n\nthat would fall within the scope of Exemption 6 would also be immune from disclosure under\n\nExemption 7(C.)\u2019\u201d Battle Born Invs. Co., LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., Civ. Action No. 24-067,\n\n2024 WL 5246515, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 2024), quoting Roth v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 642 F.3d\n\n1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nATF has shown that its redactions were appropriate under Exemption 7(C). As the\n\nagency\u2019s declarant explained, ATF \u201capplied minimal redactions as necessary to prevent the\n\ndisclosure of information that might reveal the identities of third parties\u201d within the production,\n\fincluding: (1) the personally identifiable information of ATF and FBI agents, and agency staff;\n\n(2) the social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, cell phone numbers, and family\n\nrelationships of the subjects of agency investigation; and (3) the identities of cooperating sources\n\nwho provided information to the government. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 27. There is a well-recognized and\n\nsubstantial privacy interest in withholding the identities of the law enforcement officers and\n\nsupport personnel conducting investigations. See, e.g., Lesar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 636 F.2d 472,\n\n487 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The Court of Appeals has also held that Exemption 7(C) protects the privacy\n\ninterests of all persons mentioned in law enforcement records, including suspects, witnesses, and\n\ninformants, Schrecker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and that such\n\nthird-party information is \u201ccategorically exempt\u201d from disclosure in the absence of an overriding\n\npublic interest. Nation Mag., Wash. Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 894, 896 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995).\n\nFurther, the agency\u2019s claimed redactions under Exemption 7(D) were proper. Exemption\n\n7(D) protects from disclosure information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . . . [who] furnished\n\ninformation on a confidential basis.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). A source is \u201cconfidential\u201d within\n\nthe meaning of Exemption 7(D) if they \u201cprovided information under an express assurance of\n\nconfidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.\u201d\n\nWilliams v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 69 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Here, the agency\u2019s\n\ndeclaration explains that the sources it redacted had provided tips to the ATF \u201cregarding potential\n\nillegal acquisition of firearms . . . with the implied assurance of confidentiality.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6\n\n25. The sources \u201chave ongoing relationships with ATF\u201d and \u201cwould likely be subject to retaliation\n\ffor that cooperation,\u201d so it is reasonable to infer that they provided information to the agency with\n\nthe understanding that their identities would be kept confidential. Id.\n\nAgain, plaintiff does not contest any of ATF\u2019s arguments regarding the application of\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), or 7(D), and the Court\u2019s review confirms the agency\u2019s assertions. Therefore,\n\nthe Court finds that ATF properly claimed these exemptions.\n\nC. Exemption 7(E)\n\nExemption 7(E) protects from disclosure law enforcement records \u201cto the extent that the\n\nproduction of such . . . information . . . would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). Exemption 7(E) \u201csets a relatively low bar\n\nfor the agency to justify withholding.\u201d Blackwell v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 646 F.3d 37, 42\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \u201cRather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing how the law will be\n\ncircumvented,\u201d it \u201conly requires that the [agency] demonstrate logically how the release of the\n\nrequested information might create a risk of circumvention of the law.\u201d Mayer Brown LLP v.\n\nInternal Revenue Serv., 562 F.3d 1190, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\nATF\u2019s declarant stated that the information claimed under Exemption 7(E) \u201creveals\n\nspecific law enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used to \u201cidentify certain individuals as\n\ninvestigative subjects.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 31. The information appears in the sections of the NICS\n\nforms asking for \u201cwhy\u201d the subject is under investigation and \u201chow\u201d ATF knows information\n\nabout the subject. Id. The Court agrees with ATF that disclosure of how the agency finds its\n\finvestigative subjects could logically enable individuals to \u201ccircumvent\u201d those techniques, id., so\n\nit finds that the agency\u2019s claim under Exemption 7(E) is proper.5\n\nD. Segregability\n\n\u201c[N]on-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably\n\nintertwined with exempt portions.\u201d Wilderness Soc\u2019y v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 2d 1,\n\n18 (D.D.C. 2004), quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1977). ATF\u2019s declaration explains that responsive records were reviewed \u201con a line-\n\nby-line and page-by-page basis\u201d to identify reasonably segregable information, and that all\n\n\u201cmeaningful segregable information was disclosed\u201d to plaintiffs. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 32. The Court\n\nhas also reviewed the un-redacted version of the production, and it came to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, it finds that the agency\u2019s redactions satisfy the segregability requirement.\n\nII. The Court has authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested order.\n\nWhat is left to determine is what, if anything, should happen now. Because the unredacted\n\ncopy of the thirteenth production was inadvertently produced to plaintiffs, ATF asks the Court for\n\nan order directing plaintiffs and their counsel to: (1) \u201csequester the . . . inadvertently produced\n\n5 Citing Conservation Force v. Jewell, 66 F. Supp. 3d 46, 64 (D.D.C. 2014), plaintiffs assert\nthat the ATF cannot withhold information regarding its law enforcement techniques and\nprocedures under Exemption 7(E) because those \u201ctechniques and procedures . . . are unlawful and\nunconstitutional.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 26 (emphasis in original). Indeed, plaintiffs spend a large portion\nof their brief arguing that the ATF and FBI\u2019s use of the NICS is illegal. Id. at 12\u201326. But plaintiffs\nhave not brought a suit against the agencies challenging the legality of the use of NICS; they chose\nto bring a claim under the Freedom of Information Act to enforce their request for information\nabout the ATF\u2019s use of NICS. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16\u201318. FOIA is a statute concerned with the disclosure\nof information in the government\u2019s possession.\n At any rate, Conservation Force is not on point. In that case, the agency withheld\ninformation pursuant to the attorney-client privilege under Exemption 5, and the court analyzed\nwhether the crime-fraud exception to the privilege applied. 66 F. Supp. 3d at 64; see id. (\u201cPlaintiff\nhas failed to prove that any crime or fraud was committed here, let alone that the communications\nat issue were made with an intent to further the unlawful act.\u201d). This case involves withholdings\nunder Exemption 7(E), which does not recognize an exception for crime or fraud.\n\fFOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate, disclose, or use for any\n\npurpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14.\n\nPlaintiffs take issue with the remedy only as it pertains to \u201csmall portions of [the]\n\nunredacted information.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. They do not \u201chave any interest in\u201d and \u201cagree to\n\ndestroy\u201d such records related to personally identifying information of the ATF and FBI agents,\n\nagency staff, and the subjects, associates, and informants of ATF investigation. Id. at 23\u201324. But\n\nthey do challenge the issuance of an order limiting the use of the unredacted information \u201crelated\n\nto the FBI and ATF\u2019s warrantless NICS Monitoring Program.\u201d Id. at 6, 15; see id. at 16\u201321\n\n(arguing that the public has significant interest in learning about how the \u201cNICS Monitoring\n\nProgram\u201d violates statutory prohibits and constitutional rights).\n\nSince plaintiffs have already agreed to destroy the personal information that the agency\n\nredacted under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), the Court will order it to do so. As to the rest of the\n\ninformation marked for redaction under Exemptions 3 and 7(E), the Court finds that it has the\n\nauthority to issue an order barring that information from dissemination or use.\n\na. Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police does not bar the\n Court from granting relief.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police\n\n(\u201cHRDC\u201d), 126 F.4th 708 (D.C. Cir. 2025), \u201csquarely rejected the notion\u201d that district courts have\n\ninherent authority to limit the use or dissemination of inadvertently disclosed FOIA material, and\n\ntherefore, the Court cannot grant ATF\u2019s relief. Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem. at 5; Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 3\u20137.\n\nDefendant counters that HRDC does not bar the relief sought here because: (1) it is distinguishable\n\nfrom this case; and (2) the Court can rely on its \u201cequitable power\u201d under FOIA, as opposed to its\n\n\u201cinherent authority,\u201d to enforce its judgment. Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. at 4\u20135; Def.\u2019s Opp. at 2\u20133.\n\f In HRDC, the plaintiff submitted FOIA requests to the Park Police for records of certain\n\n\u201cclaims or lawsuits brought against the agency or its employees.\u201d 126 F.4th at 714. The agency\n\nPolice released the records and \u201cwithheld the names of four police officers\u201d under Exemption 6.\n\nId. But \u201cdue to errors in its redaction process,\u201d the Park Police accidentally disclosed two names\n\nof private claimants that also should have been withheld under Exemption 6. Id. at 713\u201314. The\n\ndistrict court held that the Exemption 6 withholdings were justified as to both the officers and the\n\nprivate claimants, and it \u201cinvoked its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings . . . to issue\n\na clawback order for the erroneously produced names.\u201d Id. at 712, 714\u201315.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit reversed both rulings. First, it held that the withholding of the four\n\nofficers\u2019 names was improper because the agency failed to satisfy \u201cits burden to show that\n\ndisclosure . . . would compromise a substantial privacy interest.\u201d Id. at 715. The Court observed\n\nthat the Park Police\u2019s Vaughn index and supporting declarations were \u201cwholly conclusory,\u201d lacked\n\n\u201ceven minimal substantiation of the officers\u2019 privacy interest or the potential harm from disclosing\n\ntheir names,\u201d and \u201cmerely recite[d] the elements of the analysis for whether Exemption 6\n\napplie[d].\u201d Id. at 715\u201316.\n\nThen, without commenting on whether the inadvertently produced private citizens\u2019 names\n\nfell under Exemption 6, the Court vacated the clawback order. 126 F.4th at 719\u2013720. It took issue\n\nwith the lower court\u2019s use of its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings as a\n\n\u201cmechanism\u201d for compelling the return of inadvertently produced information when FOIA itself\n\ndid not provide for that remedy. Id. at 717. It stated that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s invocation of an inherent\n\npower must\u201d be either: (1) \u201cdocumented by historical practice\u201d; or 2) \u201csupported by an irrefutable\n\nshowing that the exercise of an undoubted authority would otherwise be set to naught.\u201d Id. at 718,\n\nquoting Cobell v. Norton, 334 F.3d 1128, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\n\fomitted). The Park Police did not argue that clawback was a \u201cdocumented historical practice,\u201d so\n\nthe Court only analyzed whether it was \u201cnecessary to buttress the district court\u2019s undoubted\n\nauthority over FOIA litigation.\u201d Id. at 718 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Circuit found that the order was not necessary, rejecting the agency\u2019s argument that it\n\nwas proper given the lower court\u2019s ruling that the inadvertently produced names fell under\n\nExemption 6. Id. at 718\u201319. The Circuit explained that \u201cnecessary\u201d orders were \u201climited to those\n\nwhich . . . are necessary to the exercise of all others,\u201d and it then listed the \u201cpowers\u201d previously\n\n\u201crecognized as necessary,\u201d including: admitting members to the bar, disciplining bar members,\n\npunishing contempt of court, vacating judgments based on fraud on the court, and punishing bad-\n\nfaith or vexatious conduct. Id. at 718, citing Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43\u201345 (1991)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because, in the Circuit\u2019s view, the \u201cprimary function\u201d of the\n\nclawback order at issue was \u201cnot to support a core judicial authority, but to fill a perceived hole in\n\nthe FOIA statute by enabling the government to put the proverbial cat back in the bag,\u201d the Court\n\nheld that it was an improper use of inherent authority. Id. at 718\u201319.\n\nThe Court went on to note that the clawback remedy could not \u201cbe squared with the terms\u201d\n\nor \u201cstructure\u201d of FOIA, given that the statute does not explicitly enable an agency to seek an order\n\ncorrecting an inadvertent disclosure. 126 F.4th at 719. The Court opined that \u201cCongress\n\npresumably acted deliberately in omitting general clawback authority from FOIA,\u201d and that,\n\n\u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations,\n\nFOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance governmental transparency.\u201d Id.\n\nStill, the Court observed:\n\nImportantly, the information at issue here is not subject to any independent\n legal prohibition on disclosure such as applies to classified documents, and\n we express no opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n analysis.\n\fId.\n\nOne problem with applying HRDC to the facts of the instant case is that the Circuit\u2019s\n\nanalysis on whether the agency properly invoked Exemption 6 referred only to the \u201cofficer names\u201d\n\nredacted by the agency, id. at 715\u201317, not the private claimants\u2019 names that were inadvertently\n\nproduced. As to that information, the Circuit moved directly to the question of whether the lower\n\ncourt had the authority to issue the clawback order at all, without deciding whether Exemption 6\n\napplied to the names in the first place. Id. at 718\u201319. So, it is not clear whether the Court\u2019s\n\ndiscussion about the clawback order was meant to reach inadvertently disclosed information that\n\nis properly, or as in this case, concededly, exempt.\n\nFurthermore, a close reading of HRDC reveals several important distinctions between that\n\ncase and this one. First, HRDC involved a plaintiff that was disputing the agency\u2019s withholdings\n\nunder FOIA, so the Circuit did not deal with the circumstances here: plaintiffs who did not contest\n\nthe agency\u2019s FOIA withholdings at all, and who have \u201cno interest\u201d in the majority of the\n\ninformation at issue. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. Given HRDC\u2019s determination that the Park Police failed to\n\nsupport its withholdings, it makes sense that clawback would not be available, whether or not it\n\nwas a proper exercise of authority, because the agency was not entitled to withhold the information\n\nin the first place. That is not the case here. As the Court has detailed, everything marked for\n\nredaction by the ATF was properly exempt, and the plaintiffs have agreed to destroy most of the\n\ninadvertently produced information.\n\nSecond, the majority of the information that plaintiffs seek to retain and to be able to\n\ndisseminate falls under Exemption 3, which authorizes ATF to withhold information that is\n\n\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure\u201d by the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). HRDC specifically carved Exemption 3 out of\n\fits ruling, noting that the information at issue was \u201cnot subject to any independent legal prohibition\n\non disclosure\u201d and that it expressed \u201cno opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n\nanalysis.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719. So, by its own language, the case does not bar the Court from granting\n\nrelief as to the Exemption 3 information, and it would be consistent with FOIA and the Act of\n\n2012 to restrain plaintiffs from disseminating such material.\n\nGiven the differences between the posture of this case and what the Court addressed in\n\nHRDC, that opinion does not control the outcome here.6\n\nIII. The law supports the Court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers under FOIA to\n fashion a remedy in accordance with Exemptions 3 and 7(E).\n\nAs far as the Court is aware, no court in this district has invoked its equitable power to bar\n\na plaintiff from disseminating or using information obtained by virtue of an agency\u2019s inadvertent\n\nproduction of FOIA-exempted information. The Freedom of Information Act itself says very little\n\nabout the remedies available under the statute. Its only language regarding the court\u2019s authority is\n\nsection 552(a)(4)(B), which vests \u201cthe district court\u201d with \u201cjurisdiction to enjoin the agency from\n\n6 The Court of Appeals in HRDC opined that the district court lacked inherent authority to\nmanage the case before it because \u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine\nthe parties\u2019 rights and obligations, FOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance\ngovernmental transparency.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719 (emphasis added). In this Court\u2019s view, that\nsentence ignores the fact that in many of the FOIA cases pending in this courthouse, the plaintiff\nhad to bring a lawsuit to activate the administrative process, and that often, it takes the court\u2019s\noversight and involvement to bring it to its conclusion. Once a lawsuit has been filed, the\nrelationship between the parties is not simply governed by agency regulations; it is the district\ncourt that establishes the schedule for the review and production of records by issuing orders. That\nis litigation. And during FOIA litigation, as in other civil litigation, the court may be called upon\nto manage and resolve disputes between the parties, or to direct them to take certain action by\nissuing other orders. Indeed, the FOIA statute explicitly recognizes this fundamental distinction\nbetween FOIA compliance as an administrative matter and FOIA litigation since it provides for an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs when a plaintiff has \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d in an\naction before the Court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). For those reasons, this Court takes issue with\nthe reasoning underlying that portion of the HRDC decision. But for the purposes of its ruling\nhere, the Court is adhering to Circuit authority, and its ruling with respect to the protective order\nis not predicated on \u201cinherent authority.\u201d\n\fwithholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld\n\nfrom the complainant.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). But both the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit\n\nhave commented on the relationship between FOIA and the court\u2019s equitable powers, and the\n\nextent to which a district court can fashion equitable remedies under the statute.\n\nIn Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1 (1974), a consolidation of\n\nthree cases, the FOIA requesters were companies that had contracts with the United States that\n\nwere subject to renegotiation under the Renegotiation Act. Id. at 3. During the negotiation process,\n\nthe government took the position that the companies had \u201crealized excessive profits\u201d under their\n\ncontracts, and when it refused to provide the documents supporting that determination, each\n\ncompany sought the information through FOIA requests. Id. at 4\u20135. After the government failed\n\nto respond to the requests, the companies filed suit under FOIA to compel the release of the\n\ninformation, and to enjoin \u201cany further renegotiation proceedings\u201d until the production. Id. at 5\u20136.\n\nThe district courts enjoined the renegotiation proceedings for each company. Id. at 6\u20138.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court ultimately found \u201cit unnecessary\u201d to decide whether the\n\ndistrict court could enjoin the negotiation proceedings because the companies had failed to exhaust\n\ntheir administrative remedies under the Renegotiation Act, id. at 20, it did comment on FOIA\u2019s\n\neffect on the court\u2019s equitable power to do so. First, the Court noted FOIA\u2019s purpose of \u201copening\n\nadministrative processes to the scrutiny of the press and general public,\u201d id. at 17, and the statute\u2019s\n\nlanguage conferring \u201cjurisdiction to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin\n\nthe agency from withholding agency records . . . improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\nat 18, citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(3). It then explained that while the statute\u2019s purpose and language\n\n\u201cmight suggest\u201d that \u201ccompelled production was intended to be the exclusive enforcement\n\nmethod,\u201d there was \u201clittle to suggest\u201d that FOIA \u201climit[s] the inherent powers of an equity court.\u201d\n\fId. at 19\u201320. In particular, the Court was persuaded that enjoining the release of information was\n\nnot the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d under FOIA because of: \u201c[t]he broad language of the FOIA, with its\n\nobvious emphasis on disclosure and with its exemptions carefully delineated as exceptions\u201d; \u201cthe\n\ntruism that Congress knows how to deprive a court of broad equitable power when it chooses so\n\nto do\u201d; and \u201cthe fact that [FOIA], to a definite degree, makes the District Court the enforcement\n\narm of the statute.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has provided further analysis on the extent and nature of the court\u2019s\n\nremedial power in FOIA cases, which it summarized and applied in Citizens for Responsibility and\n\nEthics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice (\u201cCREW\u201d), 846 F.3d 1235 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2017).\n\nIn CREW, the plaintiff sued to compel the Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d)\u2019s compliance\n\nwith FOIA\u2019s \u201creading-room\u201d provision, which \u201crequires agencies to \u2018make available for public\n\ninspection . . .\u2019 certain records, including . . . \u2018statements of policy and interpretations which have\n\nbeen adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1239, quoting\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2). The plaintiff asserted that OLC opinions were subject to the reading-room\n\nprovision, and it sought an injunction directing OLC to disclose all such documents. Id. at 1239\u2013\n\n40. But in addition to that primary form of relief, the requested injunction had four additional\n\n\u201cfeatures\u201d:\n\n(1) it would apply prospectively . . . to documents not yet created; (2) it\n would impose an affirmative obligation to disclose . . . documents\n regardless of whether someone specifically requests a given document;\n (3) it would mandate that OLC make documents available to the public, as\n opposed to just [the plaintiff]; and (4) it would require OLC to make\n available to the public an index of all such documents.\n\nId. at 1240 (emphasis in original). Concerned that FOIA did not give a district court the power\n\nto order the requested relief, the plaintiff sued under section 704 of the Administrative Procedure\n\fAct, which authorizes review of agency actions \u201cfor which there is no other adequate remedy in\n\na court.\u201d Id. at 1241, quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. But the district court dismissed the case because it\n\nfound that FOIA would provide for the plaintiff\u2019s requested remedy. Id. at 1238, 1240.\n\nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit considered whether the plaintiff could obtain the relief it was\n\nseeking under FOIA. Id. at 1241\u201342. First, it drew lessons from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in\n\nRenegotiation Board:\n\nFOIA section 552(a)(4)(B) vests courts with broad equitable authority.\n True, as the Supreme Court explained in Renegotiation Board v.\n Bannercraft Clothing Co., . . . that provision \u201cexplicitly confers jurisdiction\n to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin the agency\n from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency\n records improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d . . . But as the Court\n made clear in the same decision, Congress did not intend that language \u201cto\n limit the inherent powers of an equity court\u201d in FOIA cases. . . . \u201cOnce\n invoked, the scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers is broad, for breadth\n and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\u201d . . . This is especially so\n where, as here, \u201cfederal law is at issue and \u2018the public interest is involved,\u2019\n as a federal court\u2019s \u2018equitable powers assume an even broader and more\n flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.\u2019\u201d\n\nId. at 1241\u201342 (citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Court then explained that its own \u201ccase law reflects the wide latitude courts possess to\n\nfashion remedies under FOIA, including the power to issue prospective injunctive relief.\u201d Id. at\n\n1242. It pointed to Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), where\n\nthe Court said it was confronted with the Air Force\u2019s \u201crepeated failure to disclose documents in\n\nresponse to\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s valid FOIA requests. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242, citing Payne, 837 F.2d\n\nat 487. The Air Force eventually complied with the requests during the lawsuit, but because the\n\ngovernment exhibited a pattern of \u201crepeated delays\u201d and the plaintiff had an \u201cundeniable right\u201d to\n\nthe requested information, the Court of Appeals instructed the district court to: \u201cevaluate the\n\nlikelihood that the Air Force will return to its illicit practice of delay in the absence of an\n\finjunction\u201d and to \u201cconsider the propriety of injunctive relief\u201d to prevent future delay. Payne, 837\n\nF.2d at 488, 495.\n\nCREW then pointed to Morley v. Central Intelligence Agency, 508 F.3d 1108, 1120 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2007), as an example where it \u201crecognized courts\u2019 power to order relief beyond the simple\n\nrelease of extant records.\u201d CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. In Morley, the Court determined that the\n\nagency had failed to search for responsive material in a portion of records that were likely to be\n\nresponsive. 508 F.3d at 1119\u201320. Because FOIA has a \u201cpolicy of full agency disclosure,\u201d and a\n\nrefusal to release documents for reasons unrelated to the FOIA exemptions would constitute\n\nwithholding, the Court ordered the agency to conduct a more adequate search of its records, id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted), even though FOIA does not specifically provide\n\nfor that remedy.\n\nCREW cautioned, though, that \u201c[a]lthough broad, courts\u2019 remedial authority under section\n\n552(a)(4)(B) is not boundless,\u201d 846 F.3d at 1242, and it pointed to two previously recognized\n\nlimits. First, it noted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for\n\nFreedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980), that \u201cfederal courts have no authority to order the\n\nproduction\u201d of records no longer in the agency\u2019s possession. Id. at 139.\n\nThen it described the Circuit\u2019s decision in Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. United States\n\nDepartment of the Interior, 88 F.3d 1191 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In that case, the plaintiff sought an\n\norder requiring an agency to publish its regulations in the Federal Register in accordance with\n\nsection 552(a)(1) of FOIA. Id. at 1201\u201302. Although that section requires agencies to \u201cpublish . . .\n\nsubstantive rules of general applicability,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D), the Circuit looked to the\n\nremedial provision of FOIA to determine whether the relief sought was proper, and the Court found\n\nthat it could not order publication. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303. The remedial provision\n\fauthorizes courts \u201cto enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the\n\nproduction of any agency records improperly withheld from complainant.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). The Court reasoned that the language focusing on the \u201cproduction\u201d of\n\nrecords to \u201cthe complainant\u201d was aimed at \u201crelieving the injury suffered by the individual\n\ncomplainant, not by the general public,\u201d so it could not order the publication of regulations to the\n\npublic. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303.7\n\nAfter that discussion, the Court held in CREW that the district court had authority under\n\nFOIA to grant two of the forms of relief requested by the plaintiff: a prospective injunction to\n\ndisclose OLC opinions that had not yet been created, and an affirmative duty to disclose regardless\n\nof whether the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. But, relying on\n\nKennecott, it held that FOIA did not authorize the court to order OLC to make documents available\n\nto the public at large, as opposed to just the plaintiff. Id. at 1243.\n\nConsidering that authority, the Court finds that it falls within its equitable powers under\n\nFOIA to fashion a remedy that would bar the plaintiff from publishing inadvertently disclosed\n\ninformation that falls squarely within Exemptions 3 and 7(E). The Freedom of Information Act\n\nvests the district court with \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to settle disputes brought under the statute. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). Although section 552(a)(4)(B) states that courts can \u201cenjoin\u201d an agency from\n\nwithholding records, the Supreme Court recognized in Renegotiation Board that enjoining the\n\nagency is not the \u201cexclusive\u201d power under the statute, and that the language of that provision does\n\nnot \u201climit\u201d the Court\u2019s equitable power to grant other relief. 415 U.S. at 20. While FOIA is a\n\ndisclosure statute, Congress included nine exemptions that authorize the government to withhold\n\n7 The Court acknowledged, though, that \u201cit might seem strange for Congress to command\nagencies to \u2018currently publish\u2019 . . . documents, without in the same statute providing courts with\npower to order publication.\u201d Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202.\n\finformation, to advance a number of important interests. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(1)\u2013(9). The\n\nexemption at issue here, Exemption 3, makes it clear that FOIA disclosure cannot frustrate other\n\nstatutes that mandate against dissemination. And Exemption 7(E), which is involved to a lesser\n\nextent, gives special protection to law enforcement procedures and techniques to guard against\n\nfuture circumvention of the law. These interests, which were absent in HRDC, support the\n\ninjunction. Also, since this case involves the agency\u2019s attempt to withhold information that the\n\nstatute expressly exempts from public disclosure, it does not present the problem posed in\n\nKennecott Utah Copper Corp., where the court was being asked to take action that fell well outside\n\nthe statutory scheme.\n\nTherefore, the Court will exercise its equitable jurisdiction to enter an order barring the use\n\nof inadvertently disclosed information covered by Exemption 3 and 7(E).\n\nIV. The relief does not violate plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nFinally, plaintiffs contend that a protective order forbidding the dissemination of the\n\ninadvertently released information constitutes \u201ca classic prior restraint\u201d in violation of the First\n\nAmendment. Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective Order at 19.\n\n\u201cThe term prior restraint is used to describe . . . judicial orders forbidding certain\n\ncommunications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\u201d\n\nAlexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). A \u201cclassic\u201d case of prior restraint involves a governmental actor seeking a temporary\n\nrestraining order or permanent injunction to prevent the news media from publishing specific\n\ninformation. Id. at 550; see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)\n\n(featuring the President\u2019s attempt to secure a permanent injunction preventing the publication of\n\nthe Pentagon Papers after a whistleblower covertly shared them with the news media); Near v.\n\fMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697 (1931) (featuring local government officials seeking to\n\npermanently enjoin a local newspaper\u2019s publication of periodicals critical of the government).\n\nThis case does not present an unconstitutional prior restraint. \u201cAs a general rule, citizens\n\nhave no first amendment right of access to traditionally nonpublic government information,\u201d and\n\ntherefore \u201c[a] litigant seeking release of government information under FOIA . . . relies upon a\n\nstatutory entitlement \u2013 as narrowed by statutory exceptions \u2013 and not upon his constitutional right\n\nto free expression.\u201d McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Again, plaintiffs\n\ndid not contest the ATF\u2019s claimed FOIA exemptions, and the Court has already found that the\n\ninformation was properly exempt under the statute. So, because plaintiffs do not have a right to\n\nthe material found to be exempt under Exemptions 3 and7(E) in the first place, the Court\u2019s order\n\nsequestering it is not a violation of their First Amendment rights.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court will GRANT defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment [Dkt. # 32], and it will DENY AS MOOT plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order [Dkt. # 36]. A separate order will issue.\n\nAMY BERMAN JACKSON\n United States District Judge\n\nDATE: July 23, 2025\n\n29"

Coughenour, District Judge, Presiding\n\nSubmitted June 4, 2025\n Seattle, Washington\n\nBefore: Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould, and Patrick J. Bumatay, Circuit\nJudges.\n\nOpinion by Judge Gould;\n Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge Bumatay\n\nGOULD, Circuit Judge:\n\nWashington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon (\u201cStates\u201d) and individual expectant\n\nmothers (\u201cIndividual Plaintiffs\u201d) challenge as unconstitutional Executive Order No.\n\n14160 (\u201cExecutive Order\u201d), which purports to deny citizenship to the children born\n\nin United States territory of parents temporarily or unlawfully present in the United\n\nStates. See Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, Exec. Order\n\nNo. 14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). The district court entered a universal\n\npreliminary injunction which bars implementation of the Executive Order.\n\nDefendants appeal, contending that the States lack standing to challenge the\n\nExecutive Order, that it was error to issue a preliminary injunction, and that the scope\n\n2 25-807\n\fof the injunction is overbroad.\n\nWe address whether the Executive Order is constitutional and valid. We\n\nconclude that the Executive Order is invalid because it contradicts the plain language\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s grant of citizenship to \u201call persons born in the\n\nUnited States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\n\nBecause the Individual Plaintiffs are covered by a certified class action in\n\nanother federal court, 1 we decline to exercise jurisdiction over their claims and\n\ndismiss them. But because State Plaintiffs have standing and are likely to succeed\n\nin demonstrating that the Executive Order is unconstitutional, we affirm the district\n\ncourt\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction and its determination that a universal\n\npreliminary injunction is necessary to give the States complete relief on their claims.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n A\n The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted after the Civil War, in order to reject\n\nand refute the holding of Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 403 (1857), which in\n\nsubstance held that slaves and descendants of slaves were not citizens of the United\n\nStates, and \u201cto put citizenship beyond the power of any governmental unit to\n\ndestroy.\u201d Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 263 (1967).\n \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL 1904338 (D. N.H.\nJuly 10, 2025).\n\n3 25-807\n\f When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, whether birthright citizenship\n\napplied to the children of noncitizens was still an open question. But the Supreme\n\nCourt answered that question in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649\n\n(1898). When the case was decided, Chinese nationals in the United States were not\n\npermitted to become citizens. See Chinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, \u00a7 14, 22 Stat. 58,\n\n61 (1882). Chinese laborers could not re-enter the United States if they left. See\n\nScott Act, ch. 1064, 25 Stat. 504 (1888). Chinese laborers were also required to\n\nobtain a certificate of residence, and non-laborer Chinese persons were subject to a\n\nharsh presumption that they were unlawfully present. See Geary Act, ch. 60, 27 Stat.\n\n25 (1892).\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Supreme Court considered the case of Wong Kim\n\nArk, a Chinese-American man who was denied reentry to the United States, despite\n\nbeing born in the United States. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 652\u201353. The Supreme\n\nCourt canvassed English common law, early American decisions, and citizenship\u2019s\n\nmeaning to the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s drafters and then held that the Citizenship\n\nClause stands for \u201cthe fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the dominion\n\nof the United States, notwithstanding alienage of the parents[.]\u201d Id. at 68, 692\u201393.\n\nFor that reason, although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents would have been unable to\n\nnaturalize or even return to the United States, Wong Kim Ark acquired United States\n\ncitizenship \u201cby birth within the United States.\u201d Id. at 704\u201305. Since Wong Kim Ark\n\n4 25-807\n\fwas decided in 1898, and until this challenged Executive Order, the Judiciary,\n\nCongress, and the Executive Branch have consistently and uniformly protected the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s explicit guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the\n\nimmigration status of an individual\u2019s parents.\n\nB\n On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled\n\n\u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d Exec. Order No.\n\n14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). Section 1 of the Executive Order states\n\nin relevant part,\n\nthe privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to\n persons born in the United States:\n (1) when that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United\n States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or\n (2) when that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States at the\n time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited\n to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program\n or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United\n States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth.\n\n90. Fed. Reg. at 8449.\n\nSection 2 states that it is the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d that no federal\n\ndepartment or agency shall issue documents recognizing such persons as United\n\nStates citizens or accept documents issued by state governments recognizing such\n\npersons as citizens if they are born 30 days from the date the Executive Order was\n\nissued. Id.\n\n5 25-807\n\f Section 3 directs the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security, and Commissioner of Social Security to \u201ctake all appropriate\n\nmeasures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments\n\nand agencies are consistent with this order\u201d and mandates that officials cannot \u201cact,\n\nor forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\u201d Id. at 8449\u201350.\n\nC\n The day after the President signed the Executive Order, the States filed a\n\ncomplaint and motion for a temporary restraining order. The district court granted\n\nthe temporary restraining order. Shortly thereafter, the Individual Plaintiffs filed a\n\nputative class action. The district court consolidated the cases, and the States and\n\nIndividual Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Each group of plaintiffs moved\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, the district court granted a preliminary injunction,\n\nenjoining Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Order on a\n\nuniversal basis. The district court concluded that the States had standing and that\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 standing was undisputed. On the merits, the district court\n\nconcluded that the Executive Order likely violates both the Constitution and the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA). The district court also concluded that the\n\nStates would suffer \u201cirreparable economic harm in the absence of preliminary\n\nrelief,\u201d and that the Individual Plaintiffs faced the irreparable harm of \u201cconstitutional\n\ninfringement and the specter of deportation.\u201d Finally, the district court concluded\n\n6 25-807\n\fthat the balance of the equities and public interest strongly weighed in favor of\n\nentering a preliminary injunction, because \u201cthe rule of law is secured by a strong\n\npublic interest that the laws \u2018enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by\n\nexecutive fiat.\u2019\u201d The district court granted a universal injunction after determining\n\nthat a geographically limited injunction would be ineffective to relieve the States\u2019\n\nfinancial and administrative burdens.\n\nAfter the district court granted its injunction, other courts throughout the\n\ncountry also enjoined implementation and enforcement of the Executive Order. See\n\nDoe v. Trump, No. 25-cv-10135, 25-cv-10139, 2025 WL 485070, at *14\u201316 (D.\n\nMass. Feb. 13, 2025) (universal injunction); CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00201,\n\n2025 WL 408636, at *16\u201317 (D. Md. Feb. 2, 2025) (universal injunction); N.H.\n\nIndonesian Cmty. Support v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00038, 2025 WL 457609, at *6 (D.\n\nN.H. Feb. 11, 2025) (injunction \u201cwith respect to any individual or entity . . . within\n\nthe jurisdiction of this court\u201d). The Supreme Court accepted review on the scope of\n\nthe injunction and held that the universal scope of the injunction was impermissible\n\ninsofar as it was based on individual and associational plaintiff standing, leaving\n\nopen the question whether the universal injunction may be justified in order to give\n\ncomplete relief to the appellee States. Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. ____, No.\n\n24A884, 2025 WL 1773631 (June 27, 2025). The district court of New Hampshire\n\nhas since provisionally certified a nationwide class of plaintiffs and issued a\n\n7 25-807\n\fclasswide preliminary injunction, which it stayed until July 17, 2025, pending appeal\n\nin the First Circuit. See \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL\n\n1904338 (D. N.H. July 10, 2025).\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n A district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction, including the injunction\u2019s\n\nscope, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1073\n\n(9th Cir. 2024). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it rests its decision \u2018on an\n\nerroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous factual findings.\u2019\u201d Am. Beverage\n\nAss\u2019n v. City & County of San Francisco, 916 F.3d 749, 754 (9th Cir. 2019) (en\n\nbanc). Legal conclusions are reviewed de novo while factual findings are reviewed\n\nfor clear error. K.W. ex rel. D.W. v. Armstrong, 789 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\nIII. STANDING\n\nBecause a \u201cquestion of appellate jurisdiction must always be resolved before\n\nthe merits of an appeal are examined or addressed,\u201d we first address the questions of\n\nstanding. In re Application for Exemption from Elec. Pub. Access Fees by Jennifer\n\nGollan & Shane Shifflett, 728 F.3d 1033, 1036 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). \u201c[S]tanding must be met by persons seeking appellate\n\nreview, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.\u201d\n\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks and\n\n8 25-807\n\fcitation omitted). \u201cAll that is needed to entertain an appeal\u201d on an issue, however,\n\n\u201cis one party with standing.\u201d Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. 647, 665 (2021).\n\nUnder Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff has standing if\n\nthe plaintiff can show (1) an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is concrete and particularized and\n\nactual or imminent, not hypothetical; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the\n\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely, as opposed to merely\n\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defs.\n\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). Under this general rule, standing requires\n\na showing of injury, causation, and redressability. See id.\n\nA. STATE PLAINTIFFS\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a state has standing to bring suit where the\n\nfederal government\u2019s action directly reduces the number of individuals that a state\n\nentity serves, causing a loss of revenue that the state would have otherwise received\n\nunder an existing federal contract. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 490 (2023);\n\nsee also Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 767\u201368 (2019) (finding standing\n\nwhere the inclusion of a citizenship question was likely to lead to the undercounting\n\nof the states\u2019 populations, and that this undercounting would cause states to lose out\n\non federal funds distributed on the basis of state population); City & Cnty. of San\n\nFrancisco v. United States, 981 F.3d 742, 754 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that states\n\nhad standing to challenge a DHS rule that would render immigrants likely to\n\n9 25-807\n\fparticipate in federal programs inadmissible and ineligible for permanent residence\n\nstatus, thereby decreasing enrollment in public benefits and federal payments to the\n\nstates).\n\nHere, the States contend that the Executive Order would cause them an\n\neconomic injury by defunding and requiring substantial changes to existing public\n\nprograms such as Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title\n\nIV-E foster care, and Social Security Act (SSA)\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program.\n\nThe States have presented evidence that more than 1100 infants born each month in\n\nthe Plaintiff States would be subject to the Executive Order. If those infants are\n\ndenied citizenship, they will be ineligible for federally-backed state-run programs\n\nsuch as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care. States generally do not receive\n\nfederal reimbursements based on services to individuals who do not have a lawful,\n\nqualifying immigration status. The States accordingly allege that they will lose\n\nmillions of dollars of contracted reimbursements that they would otherwise receive.\n\nAlso, federal law requires the States to determine whether each resident served\n\nby federal benefits is eligible. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406. Because current State systems rely on birth\n\ncertificates, place of birth, or Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to determine\n\neligibility, the States contend that they will need to create new systems to determine\n\ncitizenship and maintain compliance with federal law. The States also contend that\n\n10 25-807\n\fthey will lose \u201cadministrative fees\u201d that they would otherwise receive under the\n\nSSA\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program. See Biden, 600 U.S. 489\u201390. State agencies\n\ntransmit birth data to the SSA to facilitate the assignment of SSNs, in exchange for\n\n$4\u20135 per SSN from the SSA. If the SSA no longer issued SSNs to children subject\n\nto the Executive Order, the States expect losses of $7,320\u2013$38,129 per year.\n\nDefendants argue these alleged losses are \u201cincidental downstream economic\n\neffects\u201d that are too indirect to confer standing. Defendants rely on United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023), wherein the Supreme Court stated in a footnote\n\nthat when a state asserts that federal law or policy has only generated indirect effects\n\non state revenues or state spending, \u201cthe State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n\nattenuated.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. Defendants also cite Washington v. FDA, 108 F.4th\n\n1163, 1175\u201376 (9th Cir. 2024), in which we held that a state did not have standing\n\nto challenge the FDA\u2019s elimination of its in-person dispensing requirement for\n\nmifepristone, because the state\u2019s claimed increase in Medicaid costs was too\n\nindirect.\n\nWe conclude that the States have shown that the loss of reimbursements,\n\nfunding, and additional expenses incurred by the development of a new system to\n\ndetermine eligibility are concrete and imminent injuries-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction. We agree with the district court\n\nthat the automatic and direct effect of denying citizenship to children affected by the\n\n11 25-807\n\fExecutive Order renders them ineligible for federal programs and for Social Security\n\nNumbers, which results in a quantifiable loss of funding to the States. Nothing about\n\nthis pecuniary injury is speculative given that it is \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d See\n\nClapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013). These losses are not an\n\n\u201cindirect\u201d effect on state spending that relies on a chain of causation with multiple\n\nlinks, or assumptions about the effects of medication, or the unpredictable actions of\n\nthird parties. Cf. Texas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3; Washington, 108 F.4th at 1175\u201376.\n\nInstead, as in Biden v. Nebraska, the direct effect of the challenged federal action is\n\nto decrease the number of people for which the state will receive federal funding and\n\n\u201cadministrative fees.\u201d 600 U.S. at 477, 489.\n\nDefendants\u2019 contentions to the contrary are not persuasive. They suggest that\n\nany economic losses would be \u201cself-inflicted,\u201d because the State need not provide\n\nsocial services to an individual who is ineligible under the federal program unless\n\nthey so choose. However, it was not a voluntary choice by the States for the federal\n\ngovernment to stop paying for these services, or to assume the costs that follow. See\n\nDep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767 (finding that losing \u201cout on federal funds that are\n\ndistributed on the basis of state population\u201d was a \u201csufficiently concrete and\n\nimminent injury to satisfy Article III\u201d). And the Supreme Court in Biden v.\n\nNebraska found that Missouri had alleged standing, even though its financial injury\n\nstemmed from its choice to service federal loans. See 600 U.S. 489\u2013490.\n\n12 25-807\n\fDefendants also claim that the Executive Order does not require any changes to State\n\nsystems and does not \u201cimpose any penalty for failing to make them.\u201d Although the\n\nExecutive Order does not on its face impose a duty on the States to change their\n\nmethods of determining federal eligibility, the States would nonetheless be required\n\nto make these changes to comply with other federal laws. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406.\n\nDefendants also argue that, even assuming that the States satisfy Article III,\n\nrecognizing standing here would violate the prohibition on parens patriae standing.\n\nA \u201c[s]tate does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the\n\nFederal Government.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458\n\nU.S. 592, 61 n.16 (1982). To be sure, the Supreme Court has denied states\u2019 attempts\n\nto assert third-party standing as \u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on\n\nparens patriae standing.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 n.11 (2023)\n\n(stating that Texas claimed third-party standing \u201con behalf of non-Indian families.\u201d);\n\nsee also Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024).\n\nBut the States here are not asserting standing based on the rights of their\n\ncitizens; instead, they assert injuries to their own pocketbooks that will be caused by\n\nenforcement of the Executive Order. Unlike in Brackeen and Murthy, the asserted\n\npocketbook injuries are concrete, particularized, and traceable. Cf. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. at 295\u201396 (\u201c[T]hese alleged costs are not \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to the placement\n\n13 25-807\n\fpreferences, which \u2018operate independently\u2019 of the provisions Texas identifies.\u201d);\n\nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 75 (\u201cThe States have not identified any specific speakers or\n\ntopics that they have been unable to hear or follow.\u201d).\n\nFinally, Defendants contend that third-party standing limitations also bar\n\nstanding for State plaintiffs. Prudential limitations on federal court jurisdiction\n\ndictate that: (1) a party must assert his or her own legal rights and interests, not those\n\nof others; (2) the courts will not adjudicate \u201cgeneralized grievances\u201d (i.e. \u201cabstract\n\nquestions of wide public significance\u201d); and (3) a party\u2019s claims must fall within\n\n\u201cthe zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\n\nguarantee in question.\u201d See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474\u201375 (1982) (citations omitted);\n\nsee also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) (a plaintiff \u201cmust assert his own\n\nlegal rights and interests\u201d); Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (noting\n\nthat a constitutional claim should be brought by the person \u201cat whom the\n\nconstitutional protection is aimed\u201d). However, \u201c[the Supreme Court] has allowed\n\nstanding to litigate the rights of third parties when enforcement of the challenged\n\nrestriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\u2019\n\nrights.\u201d Warth, 422 U.S. at 510.\n\nWe conclude that third-party standing limitations do not bar this action. The\n\nExecutive Order operates directly as to the States by preventing the States from\n\n14 25-807\n\freceiving funding and administrative fees that they would otherwise receive. In\n\naddition, the Executive Order prohibits departments and agencies of the United\n\nStates from accepting documents issued by State governments purporting to\n\nrecognize United States citizenship for persons subject to the Executive Order. See\n\n90 Fed. Reg. 8449. As a result, if the Executive Order is upheld, States will have to\n\nmodify their methods of determining United States citizenship and eligibility for\n\nfederal programs. The enforcement of the challenged government action against the\n\nStates thus results in the violation of third parties\u2019 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at\n\n510. We conclude that the States have standing to challenge the Executive Order as\n\nviolative of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause.\n\nB. INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS\n\nWe decline to exercise our jurisdiction with respect to the Individual\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 action and dismiss their claims. At the time that this lawsuit was filed,\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs were a group of pregnant women who are noncitizens with\n\npending applications for asylum, representing a putative class of pregnant persons\n\nand future children residing in Washington State. Defendants do not dispute their\n\nstanding. Individual Plaintiffs allege that their children would be denied citizenship\n\nas a result of the Executive Order taking effect, and that that denial of citizenship\n\nwould cause loss to them of various federal benefits. We agree with the district court\n\n15 25-807\n\fthat a denial of citizenship is a concrete and imminent injury-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction.\n\nHowever, one of the Individual Plaintiffs has since given birth while the\n\nExecutive Order is enjoined, meaning that her child is now a citizen, while the other\n\nIndividual Plaintiff was due to give birth earlier this month. Because Defendants\n\nclaim that the Executive Order does not have retroactive effect, if both Individuals\n\nhave given birth before this opinion is published, there may be a question of\n\nmootness as to the Individuals\u2019 claims. Typically, if a district court certifies a class\n\nbefore the class representative\u2019s claim becomes moot, \u201cmooting the putative class\n\nrepresentative\u2019s claim will not moot the class action.\u201d Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc.,\n\n653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011). \u201cBut where, as here, the plaintiff's claim\n\nbecomes moot before the district court certifies the class, the class action normally\n\nalso becomes moot.\u201d Slayman v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., 765 F.3d 1033, 1048\n\n(9th Cir. 2014). Because the district court below did not certify the class, there\n\nremains a question as to whether Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are moot, or whether\n\nan exception to mootness applies. We decline to address that question, because we\n\ndetermine that to the extent the Individual Plaintiffs have live claims, those claims\n\nare covered by the class action certified by the district court of New Hampshire in\n\nBarbara, and dismissal of the Individual Plaintiffs is proper on those grounds. \u201cA\n\ncourt may choose not to exercise its jurisdiction when another court having\n\n16 25-807\n\fjurisdiction over the same matter has entertained it and can achieve the same result.\u201d\n\nCrawford v. Bell, 599 F.2d 890, 893 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nThe district court of New Hampshire certified a class that includes:\n\nAll current and future persons who are born on or after February 20, 2025,\n where (1) that person's mother was unlawfully present in the United States\n and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person's birth, or (2) that person's mother's\n presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's\n father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the\n time of said person's birth.\n\nBarbara, 2025 WL 1904338, at *16. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children undoubtedly are\n\nencompassed by that class definition. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries on\n\nappeal relate to the harm faced by their children: the prospect of removal and\n\nseparation from their families, the exclusion from legal immigration status if not\n\nremoved, the denial of lawful employment and educational opportunities, and the\n\ndeprivation of both constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, both the class\n\ncertified in Barbara and the Individual Plaintiffs here seek an injunction of the\n\nExecutive Order on the basis that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the INA.\n\nSee id. at *1. There is no reason to believe that these claims will not be \u201cfully and\n\nvigorously litigated\u201d by the Barbara class representatives. See Crawford, 599 F.2d\n\nat 893. Because Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children can obtain relief for those injuries\n\nthrough the class certified by the District Court of New Hampshire, and because\n\nrelief in this court may conflict with or circumscribe the flexibility of relief in that\n\n17 25-807\n\fother case, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction over the Individual Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims and proceed only with the State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\nIV. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n A party is only entitled to a preliminary injunction if the party demonstrates\n\n\u201c[1] that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; [2] that [it] is likely to suffer an\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; [3] that the balance of equities\n\ntips in [its] favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter v.\n\nNRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \u201cLikelihood of success on the merits is \u2018the most\n\nimportant\u2019 factor; if a movant fails to meet this \u2018threshold inquiry,\u2019 we need not\n\nconsider the other factors.\u201d California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 575 (2018) (quoting\n\nDisney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation\n\nomitted)). We first consider whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits\n\nof their claims. Upon determining that they are likely to succeed, we then proceed\n\nto consider the remaining prongs of the Winter test.\n\nA. MERITS\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause. They also contend that the Executive Order\n\nviolates the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. We first address whether the Executive Order\n\nviolates the Citizenship Clause.\n\n18 25-807\n\f 1. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThe text of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause explicitly reads:\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside.\u201d U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. The parties dispute the meaning of \u201csubject to the\n\njurisdiction thereof.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the phrase \u201csubject to jurisdiction thereof\u201d means\n\n\u201csubject to United States authority and laws,\u201d and exempts a small and well-defined\n\ngroup of people who are born in United States territory yet not subject to United\n\nStates authority. Because the Executive Order attempts to exempt from citizenship\n\npersons who are both born in the United States and subject to United States authority,\n\nPlaintiffs contend that it violates the Citizenship Clause.\n\nDefendants, in contending that the Executive Order is constitutional, advance\n\na novel interpretation of the phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d They first\n\ncontend that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as used in the Citizenship Clause does not refer to\n\n\u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d i.e., jurisdiction as defined by a government\u2019s authority\n\nand lawmaking power, but instead refers to \u201cpolitical jurisdiction,\u201d which they\n\ndefine as \u201ca concept rooted in allegiance and protection.\u201d By their definition, persons\n\nare only subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States if they \u201cowe primary\n\nallegiance to the United States,\u201d excluding \u201cthose persons [who] owe allegiance to\n\n19 25-807\n\fa different sovereign.\u201d They then contend that a person only owes such allegiance\n\nto the country in which the person is permanently domiciled, and the domicile of a\n\nchild follows the domicile of the parent. They assert that because individuals present\n\ntemporarily or unlawfully in the United States cannot establish permanent domicile,\n\ntheir children born on United States soil do not owe allegiance to the United States\n\nand are not subject to its political jurisdiction.\n\na. Ordinary Meaning\n\nWe conclude that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment supports the\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 interpretation. In interpreting the text of the Constitution, courts are\n\n\u201cguided by the principle that \u2018[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the\n\nvoters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished\n\nfrom technical meaning.\u2019\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 544 U.S. 570, 576 (2008)\n\n(quoting United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 731 (1931)). When the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was adopted, as it is today, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was commonly used in\n\nreference to the power of the courts, defined as \u201c[t]he legal power or authority of\n\nhearing and determining causes.\u201d Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language 732 (1865). But in reference to nations, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was also\n\ndefined as the \u201c[p]ower of governing or legislating; the right of making or enforcing\n\nlaws; the power or right of exercising authority;\u201d and the \u201climit within which power\n\nmay be exercised,\u201d or \u201cextent of power or authority.\u201d Id; see also Benjamin\n\n20 25-807\n\fVaughan Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English\n\nJurisprudence 671 (1879) (defining jurisdiction as \u201c[t]he authority of government;\n\nthe sway of a sovereign power.\u201d). This ordinary meaning of jurisdiction is consistent\n\nwith Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d as subject to the\n\nlaws and authority of the United States.\n\nDefendants point to no contrary dictionary definitions that define jurisdiction\n\nin terms of allegiance and protection. Indeed, they make no arguments about the\n\nordinary meaning of the Citizenship Clause at all. Defendants\u2019 only argument based\n\non the text of the Citizenship Clause is that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d cannot\n\nsimply refer to \u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d because that definition would render the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s requirement of jurisdiction surplusage. They claim that the\n\nUnited States has \u201cexclusive and absolute\u201d regulatory jurisdiction within its\n\nterritory, so that all children born in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction.\n\nId. They further contend that that definition does not explain why certain groups,\n\nsuch as Native Americans and children of diplomats, were excluded from\n\ncitizenship.\n\nSupreme Court precedent makes clear that reading \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof\u201d to mean \u201csubject to United States authority and laws\u201d is not redundant. In\n\nWong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court directly addressed the meaning of the phrase\n\n\u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 169 U.S. 649. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he real\n\n21 25-807\n\fobject of\u201d the dual requirements of birth in U.S. territory and being subject to United\n\nStates jurisdiction was, \u201cto exclude, by the fewest and fittest words, (besides children\n\nof members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National\n\nGovernment, unknown to the common law), the two classes of cases, \u2013 children born\n\nof alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of\n\na foreign State, both of which . . . had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental\n\nrule of citizenship by birth within the country.\u201d Id. at 682.\n\nThe Court in Wong Kim Ark held that these \u201cclasses of cases\u201d are not fully\n\nsubject to United States authority and laws, despite Defendants\u2019 contentions to the\n\ncontrary. The Court, relying on Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in Schooner\n\nExchange, said that while \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is\n\nnecessarily exclusive and absolute,\u201d there are certain cases \u201cin which every\n\nsovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive\n\nterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 683\u2013684 (quoting Schooner Exch. v. McFaddon, 11\n\nU.S. 116, 136 (1812)). When a hostile foreign power occupies United States\n\nterritory, the Court said that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of the United States over the territory\n\n[is], of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be\n\nrightfully enforced there[.]\u201d Id. at 683 (quoting United States v. Rice, 17 U.S. 246,\n\n254 (1819)) (emphasis added). With respect to the immunity of foreign ministers\n\nfrom United States jurisdiction, \u201cthe immunity itself is granted by the governing\n\n22 25-807\n\fpower of the nation to which the minister is deputed.\u201d Id. at 685 (quoting Schooner\n\nExch., 11 U.S. at 138).\n\nThe Court contrasted these two groups with private individuals, who it stated\n\ncannot be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country that they are in, because,\n\nWhen private individuals of one nation spread themselves through another as\n business or caprice may direct . . . it would be obviously inconvenient and\n dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction, and\n the government to degradation, if such individuals or merchants did not owe\n temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of\n the country.\nId. at 685\u201386 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144) (emphasis added). The\n\nCourt\u2019s primary concern, in distinguishing private individuals from the exempted\n\ngroups, was whether they were subject to the laws and enforcement power of the\n\nUnited States. Because the Court in Wong Kim Ark reasoned that the words \u201csubject\n\nto the jurisdiction thereof\u201d must be understood \u201cin the same sense in which the like\n\nwords had been used by Chief Justice Marshall in the well known case of The\n\nExchange,\u201d the Court must have understood the phrase to refer to the United States\u2019s\n\nability to fully subject an individual to its laws. See id. at 687.\n\nThe Court in Elk v. Wilkins similarly exempted members of Indian tribes from\n\ncitizenship because they were not subject to the full regulatory authority of the\n\nUnited States.2 112 U.S. 94 (1884). While the United States could deal with the\n Congress later expanded citizenship to Native American children via statute. See\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(b) (1924).\n\n23 25-807\n\fTribes \u201ceither through treaties made by the President and Senate, or through acts of\n\nCongress in the ordinary forms of legislation,\u201d the Court in Elk recognized that,\n\n\u201c[g]eneral acts of Congress did not apply to Indians, unless so expressed as to clearly\n\nmanifest an intention to include them.\u201d Id. at 100\u201301. This statement reflects the\n\nunique position of the Tribes, which have sovereignty and are not subject to the full\n\nregulatory jurisdiction of the United States. See, e.g., Haaland v. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. 255, 310\u2013313 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (explaining that the Tribes have\n\ninherent sovereignty and are free from state jurisdiction and control).\n\nAccordingly, the Court in Elk said that members of Tribes were no more\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States \u201cthan the children of subjects of any\n\nforeign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born\n\nwithin the United States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign\n\nnations.\u201d 112 U.S. at 102. Regardless, the Court in Wong Kim Ark also held clearly\n\nthat \u201c[t]he decision in Elk v. Wilkins concerned only members of the Indian tribes\n\nwithin the United States, and had no tendency to deny citizenship to children born\n\nin the United States of foreign parents of Caucasian, African, or Mongolian descent,\n\nnot-in the diplomatic service of a foreign country.\u201d 169 U.S. at 682. Because the\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that children of diplomats, children of invading\n\narmies, and children of tribal members were understood not to be fully subject to\n\n24 25-807\n\fUnited States authority and laws, interpreting jurisdiction in accordance with its\n\nordinary meaning is not redundant.\n\nb. Supreme Court Precedent\n\nThe argument that Supreme Court precedent supports Defendants\u2019 reading is\n\nsimilarly unavailing. First, Defendants\u2019 claimed distinction between political\n\njurisdiction and regulatory jurisdiction is not supported by precedent. Both the\n\nSupreme Court and our Court have used \u201cpolitical jurisdiction\u201d to refer merely to\n\nthe United States\u2019 lawmaking authority. See, e.g., Smith v. Turner, 48 U.S. 283, 422\n\n(1849) (describing taxation as part of political jurisdiction); Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry.\n\nCo. v. McGlinn, 114 U.S. 542, 546 (1885) (describing political jurisdiction as\n\ninvolved in legislative power); Lake v. Ohana Mil. Cmtys., LLC, 14 F.4th 993, 1000\u2013\n\n01 (9th Cir. 2021) (equating political jurisdiction with \u201clegislative . . . jurisdiction\u201d).\n\nSecond, the Court did not hold or even hint that there was a requirement of\n\n\u201cprimary allegiance\u201d or exclusive allegiance in either Elk or Wong Kim Ark. To the\n\ncontrary, the Wong Kim Ark Court repeatedly equated allegiance merely with\n\nobedience to the laws of the sovereign, saying that \u201c[a]llegiance is nothing more than\n\nthe tie or duty of obedience of a subject to the sovereign under whose protection he\n\nis . . . .\u201d See, e.g., id. at 659\u2013661 (quoting Inglis v. Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 28 U.S.\n\n99, 155 (1830)). Under English common law, \u201c[s]uch allegiance and protection\n\nwere mutual . . . and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized\n\n25 25-807\n\fsubjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance; but were predicable of\n\naliens in amity, so long as they were within the kingdom.\u201d Id. at 655. Rather than\n\ndescribe this allegiance as primary or exclusive, the Court characterized the\n\nallegiance owed by foreign \u201cindividuals and merchants\u201d as \u201ctemporary and local\u201d\n\nwhich was necessary to avoid \u201csubjecting the laws to continual infraction.\u201d Id. at\n\n685 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144). The context of the opinion makes\n\nclear that the Court did not view allegiance as a separate and unspoken requirement\n\nof jurisdiction. Instead, it considered allegiance to be part and parcel of what\n\nDefendants now label \u201cregulatory\u201d jurisdiction.\n\nThird, the proposed requirement of \u201cpermanent domicile\u201d in order to establish\n\npolitical jurisdiction also finds no basis in the text of the Citizenship Clause or its\n\ninterpreting precedent. The Wong Kim Ark Court uses the phrase \u201cpermanent\u201d only\n\nin connection with domicile once, stating that although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents left\n\nthe United States in 1890, they \u201cwere at the time of his birth domiciled residents of\n\nthe United States, having previously established and still enjoying a permanent\n\ndomicil[e] and residence therein at San Francisco.\u201d Id. at 652. This statement\n\nreflects the stipulated facts of the case, and the Court did not mention \u201cpermanent\u201d\n\ndomicile in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause. See id. at 652 (\u201cThe facts of\n\nthis case, as agreed by the parties are as follows . . . .\u201d).\n\n26 25-807\n\f In its analysis, the Court said, \u201c[e]very citizen or subject of another country,\n\nwhile domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.\u201d Id. at 693. But the Court\n\nimmediately continued:\n\nIt can hardly be denied that an alien is completely subject to the political\n jurisdiction of the country in which he resides\u2014seeing that, as said by Mr.\n Webster, when Secretary of State, in his Report to the President on Thrasher\u2019s\n Case in 1851, and since repeated by this court, \u201cindependently of a residence\n with intention to continue such residence; independently of any domiciliation;\n independently of the taking of any oath of allegiance or of renouncing any\n former allegiance, it is well known that, by the public law, an alien, or a\n stranger born, for so long a time as he continues within the dominions of a\n foreign government, owes obedience to the laws of that government, and may\n be punished for treason, or other crimes, as a native-born subject might be,\n unless his case is varied by some treaty stipulations.\u201d\n\nId. at 693\u201394 (quoting 6 Daniel Webster, The Works of Daniel Webster 526 (1851)\n\n(emphasis added)). It is clear from this quoted passage both that domicile did not\n\nplay a significant role Scientology of Cal. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, 611 F.2d 738, 750 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nBut in rigorously applying our standing doctrine, I conclude that State\n\nPlaintiffs have no standing at this time. Absent a party with Article III standing, it\u2019s\n\npremature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the\n\ninjunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\nI.\n\nState Plaintiffs Lack Standing\n\nThe federal government asserts that the State Plaintiffs lack standing to\n\nchallenge the Executive Order. In response, State Plaintiffs claim standing to protect\n\ntheir sovereign and pecuniary interests. Neither ground establishes standing. First,\n\nState Plaintiffs haven\u2019t identified a cognizable sovereign interest, and they can\u2019t sue\n\nthe federal government on behalf of their citizens. Second, State Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted\n\fpecuniary injuries are too speculative and contingent at this stage to constitute\n\ninjuries in fact. Third, State Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged loss of federal reimbursements for\n\npublic benefits is a self-inflicted injury that doesn\u2019t confer standing. Finally, Biden\n\nv. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477 (2023), doesn\u2019t provide standing.\n\nA.\n\nNo Sovereign or Third-Party Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs first argue standing to bring this challenge based on their\n\n\u201csovereign interests\u201d or their ability to litigate constitutional claims that implicate\n\ntheir residents\u2019 individual rights.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory of standing is easy to dismiss. They assert a\n\n\u201csovereign interest\u201d in defending against regulation of \u201cstate citizenship.\u201d Even if\n\nsuch an interest exists, State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown how the Executive Order\n\nregulates state citizenship in any way. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447,\n\n482 (1923) (observing that States\u2019 \u201csovereign rights\u201d are not implicated if the federal\n\ngovernment does not \u201crequire the states to do or to yield anything\u201d). By its express\n\nterms, the Order only implicates the meaning of United States citizenship and only\n\ndirects action by federal executive agencies. And State Plaintiffs point to no\n\nlanguage in the Order that implicitly alters state citizenship. At most, they suggest\n\nthat deeming some of their residents not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United\n\nStates might confer on those residents \u201csome degree of immunity from state laws.\u201d\n\fAbsolutely nothing in the Executive Order says that, nor has any party advanced that\n\nview. So, while creative, this alleged injury is neither concrete nor imminent. This\n\ntheory easily fails.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 next theory of standing seeks to vindicate the rights of their\n\ncitizens. Altering who is a United States citizen, they assert, might affect their\n\nresidents\u2019 ability to vote in local elections, serve on juries, hold local office, and\n\nbecome police officers. They also argue that they can challenge the Order based on\n\na \u201clong history\u201d of state and local government challenges to Executive Branch action\n\nimpacting individual rights. Try as they may to disclaim it, distilled down, these\n\narguments are no more than an assertion of third-party standing on behalf of their\n\ncitizens\u2014also known as parens patriae. And it\u2019s blackletter law that \u201c[a] State does\n\nnot have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal\n\nGovernment.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 (2023) (simplified). That\n\nmakes \u201cth[is] issue open and shut.\u201d Id.\n\nStanding doctrine \u201cstrongly disfavors so\u2011called \u2018third\u2011party standing.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliam Baude & Samuel L. Bray, Proper Parties, Proper Relief, 137 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n153, 157 (2023). Generally, a party \u201cmust assert his own legal rights and interests,\n\nand cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201d\n\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (simplified). The risks of relaxing\n\nthird-party standing are obvious: \u201cthe courts might be \u2018called upon to decide abstract\n\fquestions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions\n\nmay be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial\n\nintervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\nGiven large state populations and the broad interests they may seek to\n\nvindicate, these concerns apply with greater force when States assert third-party\n\nstanding. Just as federal courts are not \u201croving commissions assigned to pass\n\njudgment on the validity of the Nation\u2019s laws,\u201d Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas,\n\nJ., concurring) (simplified), neither are States anointed privileged litigants to\n\nchallenge disfavored federal government action. Like other parties, States must\n\nshow a cognizable harm to themselves\u2014not just their residents\u2014before invoking\n\nfederal court jurisdiction to challenge federal government policy. As the Court\n\nrecognized long ago, \u201c[w]hile the state, under some circumstances, may sue [as\n\nrepresentatives of its citizens] for the protection of its citizens . . . it is no part of its\n\nduty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal\n\ngovernment.\u201d Mellon, 262 U.S. at 485\u201386. That\u2019s because \u201cit is the United States,\n\nand not the state, which represents them as parens patriae.\u201d Id. at 486.\n\nIndeed, in our constitutional system, the People are sovereign and do not need\n\nStates to act as intermediaries. See Ann Woolhandler & Michael G. Collins, State\n\nStanding, 81 Va. L. Rev. 387, 439 (1995) (arguing that the traditional \u201cpreference\n\nfor state-versus-individual actions over government-versus-government actions\n\fenhanced the status of the individual as a rights-holder against government\u201d);\n\nKowalski, 543 U.S. at 130 (considering \u201cwhether there is a \u2018hindrance\u2019 to the\n\npossessor\u2019s ability to protect his own interests\u201d when deciding whether to allow\n\nthird-party standing). After all, the common law basis for parens patriae was the\n\nneed to protect those who could not protect themselves. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son,\n\nInc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 600 (1982) (The royal prerogative\n\nserves to protect those who \u201care legally unable, on account of mental incapacity,\n\nwhether it proceed from 1st. nonage: 2. idiocy: or 3. lunacy: to take proper care of\n\nthemselves and their property.\u201d) (quoting \ufffd J. Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown 155\n\n(1820)); 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries 47 (The King \u201cis the general guardian\n\nof all infants, idiots, and lunatics.\u201d). Because our constitutional system enables\n\nindividuals to vindicate their own rights, courts should disfavor state third-party\n\nstanding.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a long history of upholding this principle. In South\n\nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), the Court held that South Carolina\n\nlacked standing to challenge a federal statute that the State alleged violated its\n\ncitizens\u2019 due-process rights. Because the State itself had no due process rights, it\n\ncould not raise its citizens\u2019 rights \u201cagainst the Federal Government, the ultimate\n\nparens patriae of every American citizen.\u201d Id. at 324. Next, in Brackeen, 599 U.S.\n\n255, the Supreme Court held that Texas did not have standing to argue that a federal\n\fstatute violated its citizens\u2019 equal-protection rights. Again, the Court held that a\n\nState could not \u201cassert third-party standing\u201d to bring a suit when the State itself\n\n\u201cha[d] no equal protection rights of its own.\u201d Id. at 294, 295 n.11. And most\n\nrecently, in Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024), the Court held that Missouri\n\nlacked standing to bring First Amendment claims against alleged federal government\n\ncensorship of its citizens on behalf of its citizens.\n\nSo State Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of standing to protect their residents collides with\n\nthird-party standing limitations. Though they couch it otherwise, we can\u2019t ignore\n\n\u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on parens patriae standing.\u201d\n\nBrackeen, 599 U.S. at 295 n.11. At bottom, State Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are their\n\nresidents\u2019 rights and relationships with the federal government. But as the numerous\n\nsuits filed by individual plaintiffs nationwide against the Executive Order show,\n\nindividuals are themselves capable of remedying any alleged injury. Given this, we\n\nmust deny third-party standing for State Plaintiffs.\n\nB.\n\nPecuniary Injuries Too Speculative and Contingent\n\nState Plaintiffs next assert an array of pecuniary harms to their fiscs. First,\n\nthey claim that the Executive Order will reduce their share of federal reimbursements\n\nfrom Medicaid, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d), and Title IV-E\n\nfoster care services. Because only services provided to those with U.S. citizenship\n\for certain legal immigration statuses are eligible for reimbursement under these\n\nfederal programs, State Plaintiffs allege that they will not receive reimbursements\n\nfor services provided to children born to undocumented aliens or aliens with\n\ntemporary visas. Second, the States maintain that they will incur administrative\n\nexpenses to redesign their public assistance programs and retrain their staff to verify\n\ncitizenship under the Executive Order. If citizenship is no longer determined by\n\nbirth in the United States, State Plaintiffs surmise that they will need to design new\n\ncitizen-verification protocols, update their IT infrastructure, and instruct staff to\n\nensure compliance with federal assistance programs. Finally, the States contend that\n\nthey will lose processing fees from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) for\n\ntransmitting birth-record data on U.S. citizens. Currently, the SSA pays State\n\nPlaintiffs $4 to $5 in service fees for the data, which the agency uses to generate\n\nSocial Security numbers. State Plaintiffs fear they will stop receiving this funding\n\nbecause some children born in their States will no longer be citizens under the\n\nExecutive Order.\n\nBut all these projected injuries suffer the same fatal defect. Because they sit\n\ndownstream of the Executive Order\u2019s direct effects, they rely on speculation about\n\nhow the Order might be implemented and assumptions about how independent third\n\nparties might react to its implementation. But \u201c[a]ny prediction how the Executive\n\nBranch might eventually implement\u201d the Executive Order is \u201cno more than\n\fconjecture.\u201d Trump v. New York, 592 U.S. 125, 131 (2020) (simplified). And so this\n\ncase \u201cdoes not\u2014at this time\u2014present a dispute appropriately resolved through the\n\njudicial process.\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\n1.\n\nAs stated above, we must rigorously enforce our Article III jurisdictional rules\n\nwhen asked to interfere with the actions of the political branches. \u201cA foundational\n\nprinciple of Article III is that \u2018an actual controversy must exist not only at the time\n\nthe complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified). So\n\nplaintiffs must satisfy \u201c[t]wo related doctrines of justiciability\u201d\u2014standing and\n\nripeness\u2014to advance an Article III case or controversy. Id.\n\nFirst, to show standing, plaintiffs must establish an injury in fact, causation,\n\nand redressability. Speculation can\u2019t be used to satisfy these requirements. The\n\ninjury in fact must be \u201cconcrete, particularized, and imminent rather than conjectural\n\nor hypothetical.\u201d Id. (simplified). Alleged injuries must be \u201cimpending\u201d with some\n\n\u201ccertain[ty];\u201d the mere \u201cpossibl[ility]\u201d of \u201cfuture injury\u201d is \u201ctoo speculative for\n\nArticle III purposes.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (simplified). And the causation\n\nrequirement \u201crules out\u201d standing based on \u201cattenuated links,\u201d such as \u201cwhere the\n\ngovernment action is so far removed from its distant (even if predictable) ripple\n\neffects that the plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing.\u201d FDA v. All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 383 (2024). So \u201cPlaintiffs cannot rely on\n\fspeculation about \u2018the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the\n\ncourts\u2019\u201d to claim standing. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5 (simplified). The bottom\n\nline\u2014any asserted injury can\u2019t be \u201ctoo speculative or too attenuated.\u201d All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs must show the case is \u201cripe\u201d for judicial intervention. A\n\nclaim that hinges on \u201ccontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or\n\nindeed may not occur at all\u201d is \u201cnot ripe for adjudication.\u201d Texas v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (simplified). When challenging federal actions, courts\n\noften defer review until a concrete controversy crystallizes. That\u2019s because\n\n\u201c[d]etermination of the scope\u201d of a federal action \u201cin advance of its immediate\n\nadverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an\n\ninquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &\n\nWarehousemen\u2019s Union, Loc. 37 v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224 (1954). This is\n\nespecially so when a case \u201crequire[s] guesswork as to how independent\n\ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 413.\n\n2.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of pecuniary injuries are \u201criddled with\n\ncontingencies and speculation.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 131. Their theory of standing\n\nrequires us to swallow two big pills\u2014(1) state standing based on speculative\n\nassumptions about the indirect, downstream costs of federal government action; and\n\f(2) state standing based on predictions about how a federal policy might be\n\nimplemented. Together, these concerns doom jurisdiction.\n\na.\n\nTo begin, the Executive Order itself doesn\u2019t directly withhold funding to the\n\nStates or require the States to expend any funds. And we should be skeptical of state\n\nchallenges to executive action premised on indirect fiscal effects. As the Court\n\nrecently told us:\n\n[I]n our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies\n frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\n And when a State asserts . . . that a federal law has produced only those\n kinds of indirect effects, the State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n attenuated.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3.\n\nIn Texas, Texas and Louisiana advanced the same derivative-costs theory that\n\nState Plaintiffs make here. The two States challenged new Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (\u201cDHS\u201d) Guidelines prioritizing the arrest of only certain undocumented\n\naliens. See id. at 673\u201374. To establish standing, they claimed that leaving more\n\nundocumented aliens within their borders would force them to spend \u201cmore money\n\non law enforcement, incarceration, and social services.\u201d Id. at 687 (Gorsuch, J.,\n\nconcurring). Even crediting those factual assertions, the Court found the alleged\n\ninjury \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d to support state standing. See id. at 680 n.3. After all,\n\fcontingent injuries, like those based on economic harms tied to predicted population\n\nchanges, will seldom amount to a cognizable Article III injury.\n\nAs Chief Judge Sutton asked in a similar context:\n\nAre we really going to say that any federal regulation of individuals\n through a policy statement that imposes peripheral costs on a State\n creates a cognizable Article III injury for the State to vindicate in\n federal court? If so, what limits on state standing remain? Even though\n it \u201cwould make a mockery . . . of the constitutional requirement of case\n or controversy,\u201d the States\u2019 boundless theory of standing\u2014in which all\n peripheral costs imposed on States by actions of the President create a\n cognizable Article III injury\u2014would allow them to challenge a\n \u201cdisagreeable war.\u201d Alexander Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966\n Sup. Ct. Rev. 79, 89\u201390 (1966). That is a bridge much too far.\n\nArizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J.) (simplified).\n\nTo Chief Judge Sutton\u2019s concerns, I add my own. Taken to its logical\n\nendpoint, the States\u2019 theory would grant them standing to contest virtually any\n\nfederal action that might tangentially affect who lives or is born within their borders.\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to State Plaintiffs, every person who crosses their borders\n\nrepresents a monetary cost or benefit on their financial ledgers. Consider some\n\nexamples. If the President were to raise the annual refugee cap\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because the presence of more aliens might someday increase state\n\nexpenditures on schools or emergency medical care? Or if Congress were to permit\n\nnationwide over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because easier access could depress future birth rates, and thereby\n\nreduce the accompanying SSA administrative fees? Indeed, why wouldn\u2019t a State\n\fhave standing to challenge the removal of a single alien from within its borders given\n\nthe individual\u2019s potential fiscal impact on the State? The Constitution\u2019s case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement does not stretch so thin.\n\nIf bare conjecture that a federal action might marginally alter a State\u2019s\n\npopulation\u2014and thereby its finances\u2014were sufficient for standing, the injury-in-\n\nfact prerequisite would mean little. States would be empowered to litigate every\n\nnational policy dispute under the guise of protecting their treasuries. Merely by\n\nhypothesizing downstream fiscal effects, States could enjoy near-automatic access\n\nto federal court while other litigants face exacting hurdles. Such asymmetry\n\nthreatens to convert States into de facto \u201cgeneral-public-interest plaintiffs,\u201d drawing\n\nArticle III courts into political contests we were never meant to referee. Ann\n\nWoolhandler & Michael G. Collins, Reining in State Standing, 94 Notre Dame L.\n\nRev. 2015, 2030 (2019). At a minimum, we should require costs to state treasuries\n\nto be \u201cdirectly traceable\u201d to the federal government action to establish standing.\n\nBiden, 600 U.S. at 490.\n\nb.\n\nBut these indirect effects aren\u2019t the end of the story. Because the Executive\n\nOrder was essentially enjoined on day one, we don\u2019t know how it will actually be\n\nimplemented. The Executive Order directs federal agencies to \u201cissue public\n\nguidance\u201d within 30 days \u201cregarding this order\u2019s implementation with respect to\n\ftheir operations and activities.\u201d But the district court immediately enjoined any\n\nfederal agency from \u201c[t]aking any further steps in reliance on the Executive Order,\u201d\n\nincluding providing any implementation guidance. Thus, nothing indicates the\n\ngovernment\u2019s plan for enforcing the Order, and any prediction as to how it will do\n\nso is merely a guess.\n\nCourts are often reluctant to recognize standing or ripeness when a\n\ngovernment action is challenged too soon to understand its consequences. See, e.g.,\n\nTrump, 592 U.S. at 132\u201334; Missouri ex rel. Koster v. Harris, 847 F.3d 646, 653 (9th\n\nCir. 2017) (concluding that \u201callegations about the potential economic effects\u201d of a\n\nlaw yet to be implemented \u201cwere necessarily speculative\u201d). Predicting how a\n\npresidential parchment setting a policy goal transforms into the mechanics of actual\n\ngovernment policy \u201cinvolves a significant degree of guesswork.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S.\n\nat 132. Given that the government will eventually need to consider \u201cboth legal and\n\npractical constraints, making any prediction about future injury just that\u2014a\n\nprediction.\u201d Id. at 133. Recognizing standing and ripeness based on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries risks premature interpretation of federal policy on a barebones\n\nrecord.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries depend on discretionary decisions that have\n\nyet to be made, and so any assessment of their claims to standing can only be made\n\nafter further development. Allowing \u201cthe Executive Branch\u2019s decisionmaking\n\fprocess [to] run its course\u201d would \u201cbring[] more manageable proportions to the\n\nscope of the parties\u2019 dispute,\u201d and supply the clarity essential to our review. Id. at\n\n134 (simplified). Rather than breeze past our constitutional limits to get to the\n\nmerits, all this uncertainty requires restraint. Simply, that the Executive Order could\n\nbe administered in a way that harms State Plaintiffs does not establish that it will be\n\nso administered. Nothing prevents the federal government from adopting measures\n\nthat would reduce or eliminate any projected costs to the States. But until those\n\ndiscretionary choices are made, State Plaintiffs\u2019 purported injuries remain \u201ctoo\n\nspeculative\u201d and \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383. So\n\nArticle III demands we wait until the federal government provides its plans before\n\nacting. If State Plaintiffs\u2019 fears become concrete after implementation is announced,\n\nfederal courts will stand ready to fulfill their constitutional duty.\n\n* * *\n\nBased on these twin concerns\u2014speculation on indirect, downstream costs and\n\nassumptions about uncertain implementation\u2014judicial intervention at this stage is\n\npremature.\n\n3.\n\nDrilling down more closely on State Plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations confirms\n\nthat they are, at this time, too speculative and too contingent.\n\f State Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of fiscal injury begins from the premise that every child\n\ndenied citizenship under the Executive Order will likewise be categorically barred\n\nfrom Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care benefits. But the Executive Order\u2019s\n\n\u201cimpact on funding is [un]certain.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 133. Each of these federal\n\nprograms extends not exclusively to U.S. citizens, but also to certain \u201cqualified\n\naliens.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(b). The Executive Order itself is silent on what\n\nimmigration status these children would receive. If they are granted lawful\n\npermanent residence, parole, or another qualifying status, the federal benefits\u2014and\n\nthe accompanying federal reimbursements\u2014could remain available. See id. State\n\nPlaintiffs also presuppose, again without support, that the federal government will\n\nwithhold every dollar of matching funds, that no other appropriations or grants will\n\noffset the difference, and that private social-service groups will not fill any gaps in\n\ncoverage.\n\nThus, the Executive Order \u201cwill not inexorably have the direct effect on\n\ndownstream access to funds or other resources predicted by\u201d State Plaintiffs. Trump,\n\n592 U.S. at 133. How the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d),\n\nDHS, and other federal agencies will address these issues is a \u201cfundamental\n\nuncertainty impeding proper judicial consideration at this time.\u201d Id.\n\nNor do State Plaintiffs identify any evidence that federal agencies will\n\nimplement the Executive Order in the maximally punitive fashion they predict.\n\fWashington, for example, suggests without evidence that it will lose pregnancy-care\n\nreimbursements for undocumented women whose newborns will lack citizenship.\n\nThat is merely a guess.\n\nState Plaintiffs also rely on demographic assumptions to allege these\n\npecuniary harms. They assume that the population of undocumented aliens in their\n\nStates will remain constant, that families will not relocate or repatriate, and that they\n\nwill seek coverage under the specified state programs. Whether any of this occurs\n\nturns on a morass of independent variables, including interstate migration patterns,\n\neconomic cycles, immigration enforcement policies, future congressional\n\nappropriations, and the discretionary policy choices of state, local, and federal\n\ngovernments.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of \u201cadministrative burdens\u201d fares no better. It depends\n\non a string of unsupported predictions: that HHS, SSA, and other relevant agencies\n\nwill immediately rewrite eligibility regulations, refuse to grandfather existing\n\nprocesses, mandate immediate and costly system overhauls, and deny both\n\ntransitional funding and phased\u2011compliance periods. Yet federal agencies possess\n\nample discretion to soften any new requirements\u2014by staggering effective dates,\n\nsupplying technical assistance, or fully subsidizing implementation\u2014and the record\n\ncontains no indication that they will choose the most onerous path. In any event,\n\nbecause the Executive Order by itself doesn\u2019t direct States to alter their verification\n\fsystems, the expenses State Plaintiffs might elect to incur at this stage are \u201cat least\n\npartly within [their] own control,\u201d and are neither imminent nor unavoidable. Lujan\n\nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992).\n\nFinally, State Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed loss of Social Security processing fees rests\n\non still another unsupported chain of speculation: that SSA will bar newborns\n\nwithout U.S. citizenship from receiving Social Security numbers, that SSA will see\n\nno value in continuing to receive the data supplied by State Plaintiffs, and that SSA\n\nwill withhold the processing fee. State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown that SSA will refuse\n\nto either assign Social Security numbers to non-U.S. citizens or compensate States\n\nfor transmitting birth-record data regardless of citizenship. See, e.g.,\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.104(a).\n\nAll this is too speculative and contingent to support jurisdiction over State\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim at this stage. Article III doesn\u2019t give courts license to game out\n\n\u201cwhat-ifs\u201d or to indulge worst-case scenarios. State Plaintiffs\u2019 fiscal projections rest\n\non a chain of speculative assumptions\u2014hypothesizing the most punishing\n\nimplementation to inflict maximum financial loss. In short, every fiscal injury that\n\nState Plaintiffs project depends on compounded assumptions about how multiple\n\nindependent actors\u2014federal agencies, healthcare administrators, private social\n\nservices, and even individual parents\u2014might respond to the Executive Order. The\n\nalleged harms don\u2019t flow from the Executive Order \u201cin the abstract,\u201d but rather from\n\fwhatever measures the federal agencies may eventually adopt to implement its\n\ndirective. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009). This is\n\ninsufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\n\nRigorous enforcement of the Article III requirement is indispensable. Without\n\nit, federal courts would become a forum for any parties to air generalized grievances.\n\nEven worse, federal judges would be transformed into \u201cvirtually continuing\n\nmonitors of the wisdom and soundness\u201d of federal government action. Allen v.\n\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 760 (1984) (simplified).\n\nC.\n\nAny Lost Reimbursement Would Be Self-Inflicted\n\nIn addition to being too speculative and contingent, any loss of federal\n\nreimbursements for state assistance programs would not give rise to Article III\n\nstanding because it would be a \u201cself-inflicted injur[y]\u201d\u2014\u201cnot fairly traceable to the\n\n[federal government\u2019s] purported activities.\u201d See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 418. Even\n\nif losses in federal reimbursements were to come to fruition, they would be caused\n\nby State Plaintiffs\u2019 own voluntary choices to extend benefits to aliens ineligible to\n\nreceive federal benefits. Simply, the \u201cunilateral decision[] by a group of States\u201d to\n\nextend healthcare and other benefits to those not entitled to federal reimbursement\n\ndoes not create a basis to attack the Executive Order because any \u201cfinancial injury\u201d\n\nsuffered would be \u201cdue to their own independent\u201d decisions. FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S.\n\f289, 297 (2022). After all, State Plaintiffs \u201ccannot manufacture standing merely by\n\ninflicting harm on themselves[.]\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416.\n\nPennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 (1976), tells federal courts to guard\n\nagainst self-inflicted injuries by States. In that case, Pennsylvania gave its residents\n\ntax credits for taxes paid to other States. In turn, New Jersey taxed income earned\n\nby Pennsylvanians in New Jersey. The result\u2014Pennsylvania lost tax revenue\n\nbecause of New Jersey\u2019s tax. Id. at 662\u201363. Pennsylvania then sued New Jersey.\n\nThe Court wasn\u2019t sympathetic to Pennsylvania. \u201c[N]othing prevent[ed]\n\nPennsylvania from withdrawing [its tax] credit for taxes [its residents] paid to\n\nNew Jersey,\u201d according to the Court. Id. at 664. Thus, the \u201cinjuries to the [State\u2019s]\n\nfisc[] were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by the[] . . . state legislature[].\u201d\n\nId. So when a State can avoid lost revenue by changing its tax laws, that State lacks\n\nstanding to recoup the funds. Although Pennsylvania was a matter of original\n\njurisdiction, the Court later made clear its principle also applies to Article III\n\nstanding. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297.\n\nState Plaintiffs complain that the Executive Order will cause them to lose\n\nfederal reimbursement for their social assistance programs. They identify several\n\nstate-funded programs\u2014such as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care\u2014which\n\nthey say will be underfunded because of the Executive Order. But any unreimbursed\n\fexpenditures would be the result of the States\u2019 choices to offer services to those\n\nineligible for reimbursement\u2014not the Executive Order.\n\nTake Washington\u2019s \u201cApple Health\u201d program. Apple Health is the umbrella\n\nname for Washington\u2019s medical assistance programs, which include the state-run\n\nside of Medicaid and CHIP. Both federal programs reimburse States a certain\n\npercentage of funds used to cover qualifying healthcare expenses. Historically, the\n\nCHIP federal match has been about 65%. Under federal law, with some limited\n\nexceptions, illegal aliens and those without a qualifying immigration status are not\n\neligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or other federal benefits. So federal reimbursement is\n\ncontingent on U.S. citizenship or another qualifying immigration status, such as\n\nbeing a legal permanent resident. Despite those restrictions on federal\n\nreimbursement, Washington decided to provide healthcare coverage to income-\n\nqualified children \u201cregardless of immigration status.\u201d So while citizenship or lawful\n\nimmigration status is a prerequisite for Medicaid or CHIP reimbursement,\n\nWashington volunteers to cover all children\u2014even if they do not meet the\n\n\u201cimmigration status requirements\u201d for federal reimbursement.\n\nThis is a classic self-inflicted loss. Washington\u2019s theory of injury is that the\n\nExecutive Order will lead to more non-U.S. citizens residing in the State, that the\n\nState will need to provide healthcare benefits for those aliens, and that the federal\n\ngovernment will refuse to reimburse the State for those benefits. But the decision\n\fto provide coverage to individuals regardless of immigration status was\n\nWashington\u2019s alone. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 74.09.470. Indeed, just last year, in\n\n2024, Washington chose to expand its medical assistance programs to\n\nundocumented adults. See 2023\u201325 Supplemental Operating Budget, ch. 376,\n\n\u00a7 211(82)(a), 2024 Wash. Laws 1, 338\u201339. Presumably, State Plaintiffs would argue\n\nthat this brand new policy decision exacerbates their alleged injury.\n\nThough States may extend their assistance programs to anyone they like, the\n\nfederal government\u2019s refusal to reimburse them for a voluntary policy decision\n\nwould not create a cognizable injury. Put differently, had Washington not\n\nindependently chosen to cover undocumented aliens\u2019 healthcare expenses, then the\n\nExecutive Order would not impact Washington\u2019s reimbursements at all. The federal\n\ngovernment would continue to provide reimbursements for those who qualify. That\n\nthe State elects to service residents beyond those who qualify for federal\n\nreimbursement makes its alleged injury directly traceable to Washington State\u2014not\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nUltimately, \u201c[n]othing in the challenged [Executive Order] required the\n\nplaintiff States to offer [expanded healthcare benefits]; accordingly, the financial\n\ninjury those States [allege they will suffer is] due to their own independent\u201d funding\n\ndecisions\u2014not the Executive Order. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297 (citing\n\fPennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664). And \u201c[n]o State can be heard to complain about\n\ndamage inflicted by its own hand.\u201d Pennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664.\n\nD.\n\nBiden v. Nebraska Doesn\u2019t Confer Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs rely chiefly on Biden v. Nebraska to conclude that their\n\nasserted pecuniary injuries support standing. They cite the case for the proposition\n\nthat when the federal government cuts the number of accounts a state entity serves\u2014\n\nand thereby decreases the federal funding or administrative fees to which the State\n\nwould otherwise be entitled under a contract or grant\u2014the federal government\n\ncauses the State to suffer a concrete and direct injury. That may be a fine abstract of\n\nBiden, but it\u2019s far afield from the derivative injuries State Plaintiffs assert here.\n\nSimply put, the alleged harms in Biden were the direct and inescapable result of\n\nfederal action and were in no way speculative or contingent.\n\nBiden arose from the federal government\u2019s attempt to forgive a wide swath of\n\nstudent loans. See Biden, 600 U.S. at 487\u201389. In August 2022, the Department of\n\nEducation announced that it was issuing \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d under the\n\nHigher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. See id. at 487. As\n\nit turned out, these \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d amounted to a plan to forgive a\n\nmonumental sum of student debt. See id. The plan was \u201cstraightforward\u201d\u2014\n\nborrowers with incomes below $125,000 would have their loans discharged up to\n\f$10,000 per borrower. Id. at 488. Estimates projected 43 million borrowers eligible\n\nfor relief and cancellation of about $430 billion in debt principal. Id.\n\nThat impending loan cancellation set off alarm bells for Missouri. Years\n\nbefore, Missouri had created the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority\n\n(\u201cMOHELA\u201d), an instrumentality of the State, to hold and service student loans. See\n\nid. at 488\u201389, 490\u201391. MOHELA owned over $1 billion of loans. See id. at 489.\n\nFurther, it had contracted with the federal government to service nearly $150 billion\n\nof federal loans\u2014meaning that MOHELA would collect payments on those loans\n\nand provide customer service to borrowers. See id. This was good business for\n\nMOHELA, which received $88.9 million in administrative fees for the five million\n\nfederal accounts it serviced. Id. at 489\u201390. The loan-forgiveness plan would have\n\ncompletely discharged \u201croughly half of all federal borrowers\u201d\u2014meaning\n\n\u201cMOHELA could no longer service those closed accounts.\u201d Id. at 490. So if the\n\nloan-forgiveness plan took effect, MOHELA would lose \u201c$44 million a year in fees\n\nthat it otherwise would have earned under its contract with the Department of\n\nEducation.\u201d Id. That \u201cfinancial harm [was] an injury in fact directly traceable to the\n\nSecretary\u2019s plan.\u201d Id.\n\nThe alleged injuries in Biden were certain and direct, not speculative or\n\ncontingent. Because the \u201cterms of the debt cancellation plan [were]\n\nstraightforward,\u201d there was no way MOHELA could escape unscathed\u2014it was\n\fgoing to lose $44 million a year as a direct result of the plan. Id. at 488, 490. That\u2019s\n\nnot the case here. As discussed above, it\u2019s speculative what effect the Executive\n\nOrder will have on the reimbursement and administration of Medicaid, CHIP, and\n\nTitle IV-E programs. Any fiscal impact would only be derivative of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s implementation. And since the preliminary injunction went into effect\n\nbefore the government had an opportunity to sketch out the specifics of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s enforcement, a real possibility exists that the federal government may\n\nmitigate any downstream consequences affecting these assistance programs. The\n\nsame goes for the SSA\u2019s processing fees. Nothing stops the federal government from\n\ncontinuing to collect birth data from the States or from continuing to pay processing\n\nfees. On these contingent questions, the Executive Order is silent. So the Executive\n\nOrder by itself doesn\u2019t command that States lose future downstream payments or\n\npayouts.\n\nThus, while Biden supports the proposition that the loss of federal funding or\n\nadministrative fees can be a \u201cdirect\u201d injury for standing purposes, that principle begs\n\nthe question of whether such a loss will occur at all. The more indirect and\n\nderivative the costs, the more those injuries become speculative and contingent.\n\nPicture it this way, a scraped knee is the predictable\u2014and maybe even likely\u2014\n\nconsequence of riding a skateboard. And once a child falls from his skateboard and\n\nbloodies his knees, that child has suffered a \u201cdirect injury.\u201d But no one would say\n\fthat the child was \u201cinjured\u201d as soon as his parents gifted him the skateboard\u2014no\n\nmatter how predictable the injury may have been. Likewise, the speculative and\n\ncontingent consequences of the Executive Order on federal funding and\n\nadministrative fees is worlds apart from the \u201cstraightforward\u201d terms of the\n\ncancellation plan in Biden\u2014which clearly would have discharged \u201croughly half\u201d of\n\nthe loans MOHELA serviced. Id. at 488, 490. In short, Biden does not control this\n\ncase because that case had nothing to do with Article III\u2019s bar on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries.\n\nII.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t have jurisdiction to review State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims at this\n\ntime, I do not address their merits or the scope of the district court\u2019s injunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\n30"

Prior to trial, Ortiz-Rodriguez moved to\ndismiss his indictment by collaterally attacking his 2017 deportation order\nunder 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). The district court denied his motion.\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 2 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nOn appeal, Ortiz-Rodriguez argues that he satisfied \u00a7 1326(d) because\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings involved an unknowing and\ninvoluntary waiver of judicial review and violated his due process rights by\nerroneously determining that he had committed an aggravated felony. We\ndisagree, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n I\n Ortiz-Rodriguez is not a citizen of the United States but has lived in\nthe United States for most of his life. In February 2017, Ortiz-Rodriguez\npleaded guilty in Texas state court to \u201cEvading Arrest or Detention\u201d with a\nvehicle, a third-degree felony. 1 Ortiz-Rodriguez was sentenced to two years\nof imprisonment, but before his sentence ended, DHS began expedited\nremoval proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). In October 2017, DHS\nagents served Ortiz-Rodriguez with a \u201cNotice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order\u201d (also known as a \u201cNotice of Intent\u201d or \u201cI-\n851\u201d), which informed him that he was deportable because his evading-arrest\nconviction qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\n In addition to summarizing the expedited removal procedures, 2 the\nform notified Ortiz-Rodriguez that he could be represented by counsel (at his\nown expense), explained that he had the right to file a petition for review of\nthe order in a United States Court of Appeals, and provided checkboxes\nwhere Ortiz-Rodriguez could contest his deportability or request withholding\nof removal on various grounds. The form is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix. 3\n\n_____________________\n See Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 38.04.\n See also Valdiviez-Hernandez v.

Ortiz-Rodriguez also affixed his signature and\nprinted his name within another section, beneath three checked boxes, which\nstated:\n [(1)] I Do Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding\n of Removal[,] [which was the heading of the section and was in\n bold font.]\n [(2)] I admit the allegations and charge in this Notice of Intent.\n I admit that I am deportable and acknowledge that I am not\n eligible for any form of relief from removal. I waive my right to\n rebut and contest the above charges. I do not wish to request\n withholding or deferral of removal. I wish to be removed to\n Mexico[.] [\u201cMexico\u201d was handwritten.]\n [(3)] I understand that I have the right to remain in the United\n States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for judicial review.\n I do not wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\n DHS then prepared a Final Administrative Removal Order, served\nthe order on Ortiz-Rodriguez, and removed him in January 2018. At the time,\nOrtiz-Rodriguez did not challenge or appeal the expedited removal.\n Following his removal, Ortiz-Rodriguez reentered the United States\ntwice, and he pleaded guilty both times to illegal reentry pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326. For each removal proceeding, DHS reinstated the October 2017\nremoval order and deported him.

The government provides no evidence that an\n immigration officer ever met with Valdivia-Flores to explain\n the form or the issues it raised; rather, the government merely\n relies on the sufficiency of the form\u2019s text to communicate\n Valdivia-Flores\u2019s options.\n Under these circumstances, we conclude that Valdivia-\n Flores\u2019s waiver of the right to seek judicial review was not\n considered and intelligent. 35\n But Valdivia-Flores is inconsistent with our precedents, and we\ndecline to follow it; the analysis in Valdivia-Flores is based on an evidentiary\nburden that is reversed in this circuit.

The\nfirst page of the Notice of Intent, located above the checkboxes that\npermitted Ortiz-Rodriguez to admit or contest removability, advised him that\nhe had other options and rights. The page stated he had the right to seek\ncounsel from a \u201clist of available free legal services provided to [him].\u201d It also\nstated he had the right to respond to the charges within thirteen calendar days\nand that his response could \u201crequest, for good cause, an extension of time;\nrebut the charges . . . ; request an opportunity to review the government\u2019s\nevidence; admit deportability; designate the country to which\u201d he would be\nremoved with certain reservations; \u201crequest withholding of removal\u201d under\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or deferral of removal; and request withholding or\ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The page further\nstated he could file a petition for review in a United States Court of Appeals.\n The second page of the Notice was on the back. It contained a\ncertificate of service, where Ortiz-Rodriguez signed an acknowledgment that\nhe received the Notice of Intent. Beneath that certificate of service were the\naforementioned boxes, which permitted an immigrant to check whether\nremoval was contested. Ortiz-Rodriguez was not required to check either\nbox.

This court\u2019s recent\nopinion in United States v.

Only after the prerequisites of \u00a7 1326(d) are satisfied would a\ndefendant\u2019s inability to collaterally attack a removal order rise to the level of\nconstitutional infirmity.\u201d 101 Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to satisfy \u00a7 1326(d), so any\ndue process challenge under Mendoza-Lopez also fails.\n * * *\n For the forgoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n_____________________\n See United States v.

Douglas, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n All three judges today agree that Ismael Adan Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of fundamental unfairness under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he suffered no prejudice. This alone necessitates\naffirmance. But the majority opinion nevertheless wades into a discussion of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2) and \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process requirement. I disagree with its\nanalysis in this respect and therefore dissent in part.\n I\n As one of three statutorily imposed limitations on collateral attack of\nan underlying removal order, \u00a7 1326(d)(2) requires that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nshow that \u201cthe deportation proceedings at which the order was issued\nimproperly deprived [him] of the opportunity for judicial review.\u201d 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2). The \u201cproceedings\u201d at issue here amounted to an immigration\nagent serving Ortiz-Rodriguez with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order (\u201cNotice of Intent\u201d) and obtaining his\nsignature on that form, thus subjecting Ortiz-Rodriguez to expedited\nremoval. The basis for his expedited removal was a 2017 Texas conviction\nfor evading arrest or detention with a vehicle, Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7 38.04(b)(2)(A), which qualified as an aggravated felony at that time. See 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1228 (permitting expedited removal proceedings for an\nundocumented immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony).\n Although Ortiz-Rodriguez concedes that he could have sought judicial\nreview of his expedited removal, he purportedly waived his right to seek such\nreview. According to Ortiz-Rodriguez, however, such waiver was neither\nconsidered nor intelligent, thereby depriving him of a meaningful\nopportunity for judicial review. See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S.\n828, 840 (1987); see also United States v. Hernandez Velasquez, 120 F.4th\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 30 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n1294, 1297 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[T]he burden rests with the defendant to show\nthat the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d).\n Relevant here, a portion of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s Notice of Intent reads:\n\nAs shown, Ortiz-Rodriguez did not check the first or second checkbox\nindicating that he wished to contest his removal. Nor did he check any of the\nthree checkboxes providing factual bases for contesting his removal: (1) that\nhe is a citizen or national of the United States; (2) that he is a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States; or (3) that he was not convicted of\nthe criminal offense described in the form (i.e., the evading-arrest\nconviction). Also left unchecked was the final box indicating whether he was\nattaching any supporting documentation.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez did, however, check a box on the form that stated: \u201cI\nDo Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding of Removal.\u201d He\nalso checked a box admitting to the allegations and charge listed in the Notice\nof Intent, admitting that he was deportable, and waiving his right to rebut and\ncontest the charges.\n True enough, it seems Ortiz-Rodriguez agreed to waive his right to\ncontest removal. Yet Ortiz-Rodriguez contends that the Notice of Intent\neffectively confined his ability to contest his removability to the three limited\ngrounds provided in the checkboxes, thereby leading him to believe he could\nnot challenge the determination that he had been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony. Those three checkboxes offer only factual grounds for contesting\nremoval, and a legal challenge to the aggravated-felony classification of his\nevading-arrest conviction plainly does not fall within any of the enumerated\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 31 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\noptions. Ortiz-Rodriguez therefore asserts that by presenting a finite set of\nselections, the Notice of Intent delusively suggested that he could only\ncontest his removability on those factual grounds.\n The majority disagrees with Ortiz-Rodriguez for two reasons. See ante\nat 10\u201311. First, the majority highlights that the Notice of Intent elsewhere\nreflected Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s right to petition to the appropriate court of\nappeals. Specifically, it points to a portion of the form informing Ortiz-\nRodriguez of his right to \u201cfile a petition for review of this order to the\nappropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d That portion of the form is not\ninconsistent with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s understanding of the checkboxes: read\ntogether, one could reasonably believe that he has a right to petition for\nreview, but only on the three factual grounds identified by the checkboxes.\nSee United States v. Cortez-Zepeda, No. 24-50418, 2025 WL 1904482, at *5\n(5th Cir. July 10, 2025) (unpublished) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (\u201cLogically,\nthe form\u2019s delineated reasons for filing an appeal should explain how a\ndefendant . . . can pursue the appeal described on the first page of the\nform.\u201d).\n Second, the majority notes that the form did not state that Ortiz-\nRodriguez could only raise factual challenges. But neither did it say that\nOrtiz-Rodriguez could raise legal challenges. And the Notice of Intent\u2019s\nsilence in this respect is hardly determinative of whether Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nwaiver was considered and intelligent. If anything, the form\u2019s lack of clarity\nlends further support to Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument.\n Although omitted from the majority opinion\u2019s reasoning, I wish to\ntouch upon one point raised by the Government during oral argument: that\nthe fourth checkbox indicating the attachment of supporting documentation\nserves as a general \u201ccatch-all\u201d option for contesting removability. Oral Arg.\n18:33\u201319:00. By the Government\u2019s telling, that checkbox offered Ortiz-\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 32 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nRodriguez an exhaustive basis upon which he could contest removal for any\nreason not expressly listed in the three preceding checkboxes, including a\nlegal challenge to the aggravated felony classification. The plain language of\nthat checkbox does not support this interpretation. Although indented in line\nwith the three other checkboxes, the fourth checkbox is substantively\ndistinct. It does not provide an additional reason for contestation; instead, it\nsimply indicates that a contesting party should mark that box in addition to\nany of the three superseding checkboxes when he wishes to attach supporting\ndocumentation.\n By way of example, a party contesting removal based on citizenship\nwould mark the box that reads, \u201cI am a citizen or national of the United\nStates,\u201d and, if they attach documentation like a birth or naturalization\ncertificate supporting that challenge, they may also mark the fourth checkbox\nto indicate as much. This comports with the italicized text preceding the four\ncheckboxes that says, \u201cAttach any supporting documentation.\u201d And\nregardless, it can hardly be said that \u201cattaching documents\u201d logically\nsuggests to a potential petitioner that he may raise a legal challenge. If\nintended to be a true \u201ccatch-all\u201d option as the Government suggests, there\nare a myriad of ways to more clearly provide for such an option (e.g., \u201cOther\u201d\nfollowed by a blank space to write in the basis for the challenge would surely\nbetter achieve this purpose).\n The majority opinion also makes much of the \u201cother options\u201d Ortiz-\nRodriguez had when presented with the Notice of Intent, including that he\ncould have left the waiver box unchecked. Ante at 14\u201315. That he did not do\nso, the majority suggests, somehow validates his waiver. In so doing, the\nmajority opinion glosses over the very core of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument:\nthat the \u201cchoices\u201d the form presented were misleading and, therefore, his\ndecision to check the waiver box was neither considered nor intelligent.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 33 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nAlthough Ortiz-Rodriguez was not \u201cforced to check\u201d the waiver box, that\nalone says nothing about the validity of his waiver.\n Additionally, Ortiz-Rodriguez is not alone in claiming confusion\nstemming from the Notice of Intent\u2019s limited checkboxes. Indeed, this court\ngrappled with the identical issue in a recently decided unpublished decision.\nSee Cortez-Zepeda, 2025 WL 1904482, at *3\u20134; see also id. at *4\u20135 (Dennis,\nJ., dissenting). And as the majority here acknowledges, ante at 11\u201312, the\nNinth Circuit addressed an equally misleading Notice of Intent in United\nStates v. Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2017), overruled on other\ngrounds by Alfred v. Garland, 64 F.4th 1025, 1048 (9th Cir. 2023) (en banc).\nOne question before the Valdivia-Flores court was whether the Notice of\nIntent established that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s waiver of his right to pursue a\njudicial appeal was considered and intelligent. Id. at 1206. The Ninth Circuit\nheld that it did not and, thus, the waiver did not comport with due process.\nSee id. In reaching its conclusion, the court highlighted that the Notice of\nIntent \u201cdid not include an option to contest the classification of the\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and the only check box relevant to the\nconviction itself only allowed Valdivia-Flores to contest that he \u2018was not\nconvicted of the criminal offense described.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1206. Indeed, the Ninth\nCircuit recognized that the Notice of Intent confined Valdivia-Flores to same\nthree fact-based challenges to his removal provided in Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nNotice of Intent. Id. at 1204.\n In distinguishing Valdivia-Flores, the majority opinion places great\nweight on the differing evidentiary approaches among our circuits. Ante at\n12\u201313. But even accounting for these differences, Valdivia-Flores addresses\nthe crux of the issue presented here today: a fundamentally misleading and\ndeficient form. Moreover, Ortiz-Rodriguez, like Valdivia-Flores, was not\nrepresented by legal counsel when he read and signed the Notice of Intent.\nAnd given the expedited nature of his removal proceedings, Ortiz-Rodriguez\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 34 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u201cnever had the benefit of appearing before an immigration judge, who, [ ]\npresume[ably], would have adequately conveyed both his appeal options and\nthe finality associated with waiving appeal.\u201d Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d at\n1206 (citation modified). Thus, against this backdrop, and coupled with the\nform\u2019s misleading language, I would hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s waiver of\nthe right to seek judicial review was not considered and intelligent.\n II\n The majority opinion also concludes that Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\ndemonstrate that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair\nunder \u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he (1) received procedural due process and\n(2) suffered no prejudice. Ante at 17\u201326. I agree with the latter\ndetermination, as Ortiz-Rodriguez cannot show that he would not have been\nsubject to deportation but for the alleged defect in his deportation\nproceedings. United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, 186 F.3d 651, 658\u201359 (5th\nCir. 1999). But I diverge with respect to the conclusion that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nreceived procedural due process.\n As an initial matter, the majority opinion rejects Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nargument that where a prior expedited removal order was premised on a\nconviction that was later found not to be an aggravated felony, the defendant\nhas established both that his due process rights were violated and that he\nsuffered actual prejudice. Ante at 17\u201319. I agree that our court\u2019s precedent\ndictates that removal under these circumstances does not obviate a\ndefendant\u2019s need to prove actual prejudice. See United States v. Ramirez-\nCortinas, 945 F.3d 286, 291\u201393 (5th Cir. 2019). 1 However, I would find that\n\n_____________________\n According to Ortiz-Rodriguez and the majority opinion, see ante at 17\u201318, this\ncourt\u2019s precedent stands in contrast to the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit in United\nStates v. Martinez, 786 F.3d 1227, 1230 (9th Cir. 2015) (\u201cWhere a prior removal order is\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 35 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\na due process violation necessarily occurs when, as here, the defendant was\nremoved via expedited proceedings predicated upon a conviction since\nrecognized not to qualify as an aggravated felony. See United States v.\nAlvarez, 60 F.4th 554, 558 (9th Cir. 2023) (holding that a defendant \u201ccan\nshow that his due process rights were violated by defects in his deportation\nproceeding if he shows that his underlying state conviction was not, in fact,\nan aggravated felony.\u201d).\n With due respect to my colleagues, the cases cited in the majority\nopinion do not support its contrary conclusion. See ante at 18\u201319. In United\nStates v. Parrales-Guzman, 922 F.3d 706 (5th Cir. 2019), we held that\n\u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s bar on collateral attacks attached despite the defendant\u2019s\nremoval order having rested on an unconstitutionally vague statute. Id. at\n707\u201308. Ortiz-Rodriguez does not question that holding. Indeed, Ortiz-\nRodriguez does not argue that he need not satisfy \u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s requirements\ngenerally or \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirements specifically. He merely asserts that\nbecause the Department of Homeland Security classified his evading arrest\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and that conviction was later held not to\nqualify as such, he has sufficiently established both a violation of due process\nand actual prejudice, thereby satisfying \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirement of\nfundamental unfairness. And in Parrales-Guzman, we expressly declined to\nconsider \u00a7 1326(d)(3), holding only that the defendant\u2019s collateral attack\nfailed because he did not exhaust administrative remedies as required by\n _____________________\npremised on the commission of an aggravated felony, a defendant who shows that the crime\nof which he was previously convicted was not, in fact, an aggravated felony, has established\nboth that his due process rights were violated and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d).\nBut more recent decisions from that court seemingly align with our requirement of an\nindependent showing of actual prejudice. See, e.g., United States v. Orozco-Orozco, 94 F.4th\n1118, 1128 (9th Cir. 2024) (holding that a defendant whose removal was based on a\nconviction that did not constitute an aggravated felony had established that the order of\nremoval was defective but \u201cmust [also] show that the defect prejudiced him\u201d).\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 36 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u00a7 1326(d)(1). Id. at 707\u201308, 708 n.1. So, contrary to the majority\u2019s reading\nof that case, we had no occasion to consider the \u201cidentical argument\u201d raised\nby Ortiz-Rodriguez. Ante at 18.\n Our decision in United States v. Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d 286,\nlikewise offers no insight into whether a due process violation has occurred.\nWe held in that case that a defendant whose prior removal was based on a\nconviction no longer deemed an aggravated felony must demonstrate actual\nprejudice under \u00a7 1326(d)(3). Id. at 292\u201393. In other words, \u201c[i]f despite the\nalleged errors, the proceeding could not have yielded a different result,\u201d the\ndefendant\u2019s collateral attack fails for lack of actual prejudice. Id. at 292\n(citation modified). But nothing in Ramirez-Cortinas suggests that the same\nis true for the due process requirement of \u00a7 1326(d)(3); because the\ndefendant failed to show actual prejudice, we did not reach the issue of\nwhether the defendant\u2019s due process rights had been violated.\n The majority opinion\u2019s reliance upon United States v. Palomar-\nSantiago, 593 U.S. 321, 327 (2021), is equally misplaced. There, the Court\nunanimously rejected the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit \u201cthat\ndefendants are excused from proving the first two requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)\nif they were not convicted of an offense that made them removable.\u201d Id. at\n326 (citation modified). The Court reasoned that such a rule allowing an\nundocumented immigrant to circumvent the normal review process when\nthere was a substantive error in the removal order made little sense \u201cif\nfurther administrative review, and then judicial review if necessary, could fix\nthat very error.\u201d Id. at 328. Highlighting the statute\u2019s conjunctive language,\nthe Court held that \u00a7 1326(d) makes clear that its requirements are\n\u201cmandatory,\u201d id. at 326 (quoting Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016));\nthus, the procedural requirements of administrative exhaustion and\ndeprivation of judicial review \u201care not satisfied just because a noncitizen was\nremoved for an offense that did not in fact render him removable,\u201d id. at 327.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 37 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nThe majority opinion extends the Court\u2019s reasoning in Palomar-\nSantiago to \u00a7 1326(d)(3), noting that like \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2), the\nfundamental fairness prong presents \u201c\u2018a question of procedure,\u2019 not\nsubstance.\u201d Ante at 19 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d 225,\n230 (5th Cir. 2002)). Perhaps even more telling is the Court\u2019s unequivocal\nstatement that \u201cdefendants must meet all three\u201d prerequisites of \u00a7 1326(d).\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 326. Again, Ortiz-Rodriguez does not dispute\nthis point. The question he presents is whether he has satisfied those\nmandatory prerequisites for collateral attack of his removal order. The\nPalomar-Santiago Court did not consider that question because \u201cthe narrow\nquestion th[e] Court granted certiorari to decide\u201d asked only whether the\ndefendant was \u201cexcused from\u201d satisfying the first two statutory\nrequirements of \u00a7 1326(d). Id. at 323, 328 n.4.\n What is evident from Palomar-Santiago is that the substantive error of\nwhich Ortiz-Rodriguez complains\u2014that his removal order was premised on\na conviction later found not to be a removable aggravated felony offense\u2014\nneither excuses nor satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2). See id.\nat 327 (\u201cIndeed, the substantive validity of the removal order is quite distinct\nfrom whether the noncitizen exhausted his administrative remedies . . . or\nwas deprived of the opportunity for judicial review . . . .\u201d). The Court\u2019s\nreasoning similarly applies to the actual prejudice requirement of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3): one who is otherwise deportable suffers no prejudice from\nremoval predicated on a conviction that no longer qualifies as an aggravated\nfelony, so that error in felony classification alone does not prove actual\nprejudice. See Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d at 239.\n The same, however, is not true of \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process\nrequirement. When, as here, a defendant\u2019s removal order was premised\nupon a conviction later determined not to be an aggravated felony, that error\nrenders the order defective. See Alvarez, 60 F.4th at 558. Such defects in the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 38 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nunderlying deportation proceeding, in turn, show that defendant\u2019s due\nprocess rights were violated. See id. (holding that due process violations\noccur from defects in underlying deportation proceedings); United States v.\nGuzman, 998 F.3d 562, 566\u201367 (4th Cir. 2021) (same); United States v.\nEstrada, 876 F.3d 885, 887 (6th Cir. 2017) (same). This is so because absent\nthat aggravated felony classification, the defendant would not have been\nsubject to expedited removal proceedings. Instead, the defendant would\nhave had the opportunity to appear before an immigration judge and proffer\ndefenses and, if unsuccessful, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 324. But those processes are unavailable in\nexpedited removal proceedings. Therefore, by subjecting the defendant to\nexpedited removal based upon an error in felony classification, it cannot be\nsaid that \u201cthe administrative deportation procedures . . . afforded [the\ndefendant] the unimpeded opportunity to claim all the procedural due\nprocess to which he was constitutionally entitled.\u201d Benitez-Villafuerte, 186\nF.3d at 657. For these reasons, I would also hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez has\nshown a violation of his due process rights.\n\n38"

(c) (section 1011(c)).)\nCalifornia Insurance Company (CIC or CIC I) attempted, without\nthe commissioner\u2019s consent, to merge with a newly-formed New\nMexico corporation, California Insurance Company II, Inc.\n(CIC II), to redomesticate in that state. The trial court therefore\ngranted the commissioner\u2019s application to be appointed as CIC\u2019s\nconservator. Several years later, the trial court approved and\nadopted the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan that specified the\nterms for ending the conservatorship.\n CIC now appeals, arguing the conservatorship was\nunlawfully imposed and should have been vacated. CIC also\ncontends the trial court abused its discretion in approving the\nrehabilitation plan because the plan requires CIC to settle\ncertain litigation against CIC by its policyholders. CIC further\nobjects to a provision in the plan requiring that CIC\u2019s California\npolicies be reinsured and assumed by another company, and, if\nthe reinsurer is affiliated with CIC, that the reinsurer use an\nindependent third-party administrator. We find no merit in\nCIC\u2019s arguments and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n BACKGROUND\n CIC provides worker\u2019s compensation insurance to\nbusinesses. Eighty-five percent of its business is in California.\n Most worker\u2019s compensation insurance consists of\nguaranteed cost policies, under which the policyholder pays the\nsame premium rate regardless of the amount of claims ultimately\n\n1 Undesignated statutory citations are to the Insurance\n\nCode.\n\ffiled under the policy. Another type of policy is a retrospective\nrating plan, under which the premium a policyholder owes is\nadjusted after the end of the policy period, within minimum and\nmaximum levels, based on the amount of losses during the policy\nperiod. (The Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Lara (2022)\n84 Cal.App.5th 1119, 1125.) Because the premium changes based\non the amount of losses, a retrospective rating plan returns some\nrisk to the policyholder. Only large employers can qualify for\nretrospective rating plans because smaller employers are\npresumed to be less sophisticated insurance consumers and less\nable to predict their future losses.\n Retrospective rating plans are issued through an\nendorsement to a guaranteed cost policy. (See The Travelers\nIndemnity Co. v. Lara, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.)\nCalifornia law prohibits an insurer from issuing a worker\u2019s\ncompensation policy or endorsement unless the insurer files a\ncopy of the form or endorsement with a rating organization, the\nWorkers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau, which in turn\npasses it on to the commissioner for approval. (\u00a7 11658,\nsubd. (a).)\n I. EquityComp and Ensuing Litigation\n In 2011, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Steven\nMenzies, together with others, patented a \u201cReinsurance\nParticipation Agreement\u201d (RPA). The RPA was designed to allow\nan insurer to offer a retrospective rating policy to small and\nmedium-sized companies. The RPA would accomplish this by\nhaving an employer take out a guaranteed cost policy, then the\n\finsurer would cede some of the insured risk to a reinsurer, such\nas a captive reinsurer, together with a portion of the premium.\nThe reinsurer would then enter into a side agreement with the\npolicyholder to cede some of that risk back to the policyholder. At\nthe end of the policy period, the reinsurer would refund some of\nthe premiums to the policyholder if the losses were lower than\nexpected or charge the policyholder more if the losses were\nhigher.\n Under a program called EquityComp, CIC followed this\ntemplate and issued guaranteed cost policies that had been\nsubmitted to the rating organization for the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. CIC had its affiliate, Applied Underwriters Captive\nReinsurance Assurance Company (AUCRA), reinsure some of the\nrisk and issue the side agreements to the policyholders, which\nwere not submitted for the commissioner\u2019s approval. An actuary\nemployed by the California Department of Insurance\n(department) opined that CIC\u2019s rates on the standard form policy\nwere on the order of 33 percent higher than the industry average.\n Beginning in 2012, 68 EquityComp policyholders filed\nvarious claims or actions challenging the RPA. In a 2016 ruling\nin one of those challenges, the commissioner found that the RPA\nconstituted a misapplication of CIC\u2019s filed rates in violation of\nsection 11737. (Matter of Shasta Linen Supply, Inc., Insurance\nCommissioner (June 22, 2016) No. AHB-WCA-14-31 (Shasta\nLinen).) The commissioner\u2019s Shasta Linen decision declared that\nCIC\u2019s failure to file and secure approval of the RPA as required\nby section 11658 rendered it void as a matter of law.\n\f CIC petitioned for review of Shasta Linen in Los Angeles\nSuperior Court, and in 2017 the parties settled their dispute.\nThe parties agreed they had a good faith dispute about whether\nthe RPA was void as a matter of law and the remedy authorized\nby the Insurance Code. A recital to the agreement stated that\nthis dispute was \u201cultimately for the courts to decide.\u201d CIC and\nthe department further agreed that the Shasta Linen decision\nwas precedential in administrative proceedings before the\ndepartment, the department had approved an amended RPA with\nadditional disclosures, CIC would not change the amended RPA\nwithout submitting it to the department for review and approval,\nand CIC would dismiss its writ petition. One paragraph of the\nsettlement agreement declared that nothing in it \u201climit[ed] the\npower of the Commissioner to initiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d No employers in California bought any\nEquityComp policies containing the amended RPA after the\nsettlement.\n Litigation on the other RPA claims and actions\npolicyholders had filed against CIC continued in California\ncourts, federal courts, administrative proceedings before the\ncommissioner, and in arbitration. CIC succeeded in defeating\nclass certification motions. (E.g., National Convention Services,\nLLC v. Applied Underwriters Capital Risk Assurance Co.\n(S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2019, No. 15cv7063) 2019 WL 3409882, at *1;\n\fShasta Linen Supply, Inc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (E.D.Cal.\nApr. 17, 2019, Nos. 2:16-cv-158-WBS AC, 2:16-cv-1211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 3244487, at *2.) One federal court granted CIC and its\naffiliates summary judgment on claims that the RPA violated the\nUnfair Competition Law because it was void. (Pet Food Express,\nLtd. v. AUI (E.D.Cal. Sept. 12, 2019, No. 2:16-cv-01211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 4318584, at *2, *4.)\n In other actions, federal district courts ruled that\npolicyholders were liable for premiums due under CIC\u2019s standard\nform guaranteed cost insurance policies even though the RPA\nwas void or regardless of whether it was void. (E.g., Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb. Aug. 2, 2018,\nNo. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4 [granting summary\njudgment on premiums due under guaranteed cost policy without\ndeciding whether RPA was void].) Ten administrative decisions\nby the commissioner likewise declared the RPA to be void and\nunlawful but affirmed the legality of CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npolicies. In California courts, this court and two other appellate\ncourts held that CIC\u2019s failure to file the RPA or related\nagreement with the commissioner rendered the arbitration\nagreement contained within the RPA or related agreement void\nas a matter of law. (Jackpot Harvesting, Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 719, 738; Luxor Cabs,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (2018)\n30 Cal.App.5th 970, 976\u2013977 (Luxor Cabs); Nielsen Contracting,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1096,\n1113\u20131114 (Nielsen Contracting).) Many trial courts before and\n\fafter these decisions likewise held that the RPA\u2019s arbitration\nprovision or the RPA in its entirety was void or invalid. Two\narbitrators found the RPA to be valid, one made no ruling on its\nlegality, one did not rule on its legality under section 11658 but\nfound it contained misrepresentations and was unconscionable,\none found the RPA should have been filed but that the\npolicyholder did not have a private right of action to enforce that\nrequirement, and seven found the RPA to be invalid in whole or\nin part. Some of those arbitrators awarded damages to the\npolicyholder. One of those seven, like the federal decisions,\nissued an award requiring the policyholder to pay premiums due\nto CIC under the guaranteed cost policy. Many cases have yet to\nbe fully resolved because of a stay in connection with the\ninitiation of the conservatorship at issue here.\n II. Menzies Acquisition and Attempted Merger\n As of January 2019, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire\nHathaway) indirectly owned 81 percent of CIC and its affiliates.\nBerkshire Hathaway agreed that month to sell its shares to\nMenzies, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, who already\nowned 11.5 percent of the company. The agreement allowed\nBerkshire Hathaway to retain a $50 million breakup fee if the\ntransaction did not close by September 30, 2019.\n As required by section 1215.2, subdivision (a), in April 2019\nMenzies submitted an application to the department for approval\nof the transaction. The application informed the commissioner of\nthe breakup fee and transaction deadline. The commissioner had\n60 days to act on the application. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d).) After the\n\fcommissioner found Menzies\u2019 first two applications insufficient\nand Menzies withdrew them, Menzies submitted a third\napplication on September 7, 2019.\n On September 13, 2019, the department sent CIC various\nfollow-up questions, including a question about CIC\u2019s total\nliability in pending litigation. CIC responded that it was\ndefending 50 cases and its total liability was $50 million. CIC at\nthe time had $1.1 billion in assets, $615 million in capital and\nsurplus, and $240 million on deposit with the department. On\nSeptember 19 and 24, 2019, the department asked follow-up\nquestions on other matters, to which CIC promptly responded.\nOn September 27, 2019, the department informed CIC that it\ncould neither approve nor disapprove CIC\u2019s application by\nSeptember 30 because it had numerous remaining questions\nabout the pending litigation\u2019s financial impact on CIC.\n Berkshire Hathaway required CIC to pay $10 million for an\nextension of the transaction deadline until October 10, 2019.\nMenzies then proposed and the New Mexico Office of the\nSuperintendent of Insurance agreed to hold an expedited\napproval process to re-domesticate CIC in New Mexico by\nmerging CIC into a newly formed New Mexico corporation, CIC\nII. On October 9, 2019, a department attorney participated in a\nconfidential meeting of New Mexico, Texas, and California\ninsurance regulators. Later the same day, the New Mexico\nsuperintendent of insurance held a hearing on CIC\u2019s merger\napplication. Department representatives monitored the hearing\nby phone. A New Mexico official testified that after the meeting\n\fearlier that day, she was aware of objections from other\nregulators. The New Mexico superintendent approved the\nmerger, conditioned on the stock transactions between Menzies\nand Berkshire Hathaway closing by October 10, 2019, and CIC II\nimmediately afterwards filing articles of merger with the New\nMexico Secretary of State. The New Mexico order required CIC\nII to assume liability for all of CIC\u2019s issued policies and maintain\nits $240 million deposit with the department.\n In a press release after the hearing, the New Mexico Office\nof the Superintendent of Insurance announced that during the\npre-meeting call the department had failed to articulate any basis\nfor denying the proposed merger under New Mexico law and had\nsaid that the proposed merger presented no risks to California\npolicyholders. However, the department representatives said\nafterwards that they had never made the latter statement. The\npress release also said that no one in attendance at the hearing\noffered any objection to the merger. The department\nrepresentatives later said they did not register an objection\nduring the hearing because the issue in the hearing was whether\nto approve a transaction under New Mexico law, which was an\nissue for the New Mexico regulator.\n Later on the day of the hearing, Berkshire Hathaway\nnotified the department that, based on the lack of objections at\nthe hearing, it intended to close the sale to Menzies on October\n10, 2019. On the same day, the department notified CIC that if\nthe merger was completed without the commissioner\u2019s approval,\nCIC would be in violation of California law. Post-merger, CIC\n\fwould cease to exist, and CIC II, as an unlicensed insurer, would\nbe precluded from transacting the business of insurance in\nCalifornia until it became admitted. 2 The department did not\nrespond to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s letter, and its transaction with\nMenzies closed.\n CIC II satisfied the New Mexico superintendent\u2019s\nconditions for approval, so the merger of CIC with CIC II would\nbe completed by filing a certificate of merger with the California\nSecretary of State. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) On October\n22, 2019, the department asked CIC by telephone not to file the\ncertificate of merger with the California Secretary of State so\nthat the parties could meet and resolve their issues. CIC agreed,\nbut the parties never met.\n III. Conservatorship\n On November 4, 2019, without notice to CIC, the\ncommissioner filed an ex parte application to be appointed\nconservator of CIC. The application relied on section 1011(c),\nwhich requires a court to appoint the commissioner as\nconservator of an insurance company if the commissioner shows\nthe company has, without the commissioner\u2019s consent,\ntransferred or attempted to transfer substantially its entire\n\n2 A company is \u201cadmitted\u201d to transact a class of insurance\n\nby obtaining a certificate of authority from the commissioner.\n(\u00a7 700, subd. (a).) Before issuing a certificate of authority, the\ncommissioner must consider the applicant\u2019s qualifications with\nrespect to, among other things, capital and surplus, financial\nstability, and reinsurance, as well as the \u201ccompetency, character,\nand integrity of management\u201d and the \u201cfairness and honesty of\nmethods of doing business.\u201d (\u00a7 717.)\n\fbusiness or entered into a transaction to merge. The\ncommissioner alleged CIC violated this provision by attempting\nto merge with CIC II without the commissioner\u2019s approval under\nsection 1215.2, subdivision (a). The commissioner further alleged\nthat providing notice of the application to CIC would have been\nprejudicial because CIC could have completed the merger by\nfiling the certificate of merger. The trial court issued the\nrequested order the same day.\n In January 2020, CIC moved to vacate the conservatorship\norder, arguing, among other things, that the conservatorship was\nunnecessary because CIC consented to an injunction against the\nmerger pending the commissioner\u2019s approval. In August 2020,\nthe trial court denied CIC\u2019s motion. CIC challenged the order by\nfiling a petition for writ of mandate in this court in October 2020,\nbut this court summarily denied CIC\u2019s petition. (Cal. Ins. Co. v.\nSuperior Court (Nov. 25, 2020, A161049).) CIC II and an affiliate\nof CIC filed federal actions seeking to vacate the conservatorship\nand enjoin it. (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n530 F.Supp.3d 914; California Ins. Co. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n547 F.Supp.3d 908.) The district courts dismissed both suits, and\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara (9th Cir. 2022) 37 F.4th 579, 600.)\n IV. Rehabilitation Plan\n In October 2020, the commissioner filed an application for\napproval of a rehabilitation plan, which would end the\nconservatorship. Two aspects of the plan are relevant here.\n\f Section 2.2 of the plan would require CIC and AUCRA to\nenter into an \u201cAssumption Reinsurance and Administration\nAgreement\u201d to allow an insurer admitted in California to reinsure\nand assume all of CIC\u2019s California policies and liabilities to\npolicyholders. Under this provision of the plan, the commissioner\nwould solicit bids and select the reinsurer. If the commissioner\nwere to select an affiliate of CIC as the reinsurer, that reinsurer\nwould have to hire an independent third-party administrator for\nclaims administration. Upon the effective date of the assumption\nand reinsurance agreement, the commissioner as CIC\u2019s\nconservator would effectuate the merger of CIC into CIC II,\nthereby redomesticating CIC in New Mexico, and cancel CIC\u2019s\ncertificate of authority to transact business in California.\n Section 2.6 concerns the pending litigation against CIC.\nSection 2.6 incorporated by reference schedule 2.6, which sets out\nthree options under which CIC and AUCRA would offer to settle\nthe litigation against them. Option 1 would allow policyholders\nto renounce the RPA and obtain restitution of any amounts they\npaid CIC over the cost of the guaranteed cost policy premiums.\nOption 2 would allow policyholders to renounce the RPA and\nobtain restitution of any amounts they paid over the cost of a\nstandard, approved retrospective rating plan at the time of the\npolicy\u2019s inception. And option 3 would allow policyholders to\nratify the RPA and accept liability under it. CIC\u2019s liability to any\nclaimant who did not accept one of the settlement options would\npass to the reinsurer under the reinsurance and assumption\n\fagreement, and the conservator would set aside a reserve amount\nto cover those claims.\n CIC opposed the settlement provision in section 2.6 of the\nplan. It did not object to the reinsurance and assumption\nprovision in section 2.2, so long as its affiliate Continental\nIndemnity Company (Continental) had the right to match any\nother company\u2019s offer for CIC\u2019s California policies and the\ncommissioner dropped the requirement that an affiliate reinsurer\nuse an independent third-party administrator for claims\nhandling.\n The trial court approved the plan in April 2024. CIC\nappealed and also filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging\nthe approval of the plan. This court summarily denied the\npetition in a one-paragraph order, noting that CIC had failed to\ndemonstrate that its remedy on appeal was inadequate. (Cal.\nIns. Co. v. Superior Court (June 20, 2024, A170573).)\n DISCUSSION\n I. Appealability\n An order approving a rehabilitation plan for an insurer\nunder a conservatorship is appealable under section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Quackenbush\nv. Mission Ins. Co. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 458, 461, fn. 1, citing\nCode Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(1) & Carpenter v. Pacific Mut.\nLife Ins. Co. (1937) 10 Cal.2d 307, 322\u2013323 (Carpenter).)\n The commissioner disputes this and urges us to treat the\nappeal as a writ proceeding. He asserts that a conservatorship\nproceeding under Insurance Code section 1011 is a special\n\fproceeding to which section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure\ndoes not apply. He points out that section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) is contained in Part 2 of that code and that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court \u201clong ago held that Part 2 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure extends generally only to civil \u2018actions,\u2019 and not\nto \u2018special proceedings.\u2019 \u201d (Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.\nTex-Cal Land Management, Inc. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707.) That\nremark, however, concerned the applicability of the appellate\nstay provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 916 et seq. (Tex-\nCal, at pp. 706\u2013707.) In the same case, the California Supreme\nCourt also observed that \u201c[i]t has long been established that the\nstatutory right of appeal of final judgments and orders extends\neven to \u2018special proceedings [including] those intended to be\nsummary in nature\u2019 unless the Legislature has expressly\nprohibited an appeal in the particular case.\u201d (Id. at p. 705.)\nConsistent with this statement is Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at\npages 322\u2013323, which entertained an appeal from an order\napproving a rehabilitation plan and held that the appeal\nencompassed all preliminary orders that preceded it.\n The commissioner fears that aggrieved parties in\nconservation proceedings will assert a right to immediate appeal\nfrom different types of rulings, including procedural orders and\nevidentiary findings, which will create confusion and delay. We\ndo not hold that any conservation-related order is appealable,\nmerely that the rehabilitation plan order that will resolve the\n\fconservation is appealable. 3 The commissioner also suggests that\nthe approval of the rehabilitation plan does not determine all of\nCIC\u2019s rights, since the commissioner will still periodically require\njudicial orders relating to implementation of the plan. But\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 323, noted that a proceeding\nfor a conservatorship of an insurer lasts \u201cuntil the proposed plan\nis ultimately passed upon.\u201d In addition, a final judgment is a\ndetermination that \u201c \u2018 \u201cterminates the litigation between the\nparties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done\nbut to enforce by execution what has been determined.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 288, 304.) The\norder approving the rehabilitation plan fits this description, since\nthe only thing remaining after that order is the execution of the\nplan, at the end of which CIC will merge with CIC II and cease to\nexist as an independent entity. We therefore agree with CIC that\nthe order approving the rehabilitation plan is appealable, and we\n\n3 In particular, interim orders involving the conservator\u2019s\n\nmanagement of the conserved insurer would likely not be\nappealable. For example, in this case CIC moved to modify the\nconservatorship order and to vacate the conservatorship. CIC\nnoted in its petition for writ of mandate challenging those orders\nthat they were not appealable. Similarly, an order allowing\ndiscovery, like the one the trial court entered here, or an order\napproving the commissioner\u2019s fixing of expenses of\nconservatorship, to be paid out of the assets of the conserved\ninsurer (\u00a7 1035, subd. (a)), would likely not be appealable under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(1). Any\nchallenge to such orders would have to be pursued by writ\npetition or in an appeal from the order approving the\nrehabilitation plan or otherwise ending the conservatorship.\n\fdecline the commissioner\u2019s invitation to treat the appeal as a writ\nproceeding.\n II. Standard of Review\n The commissioner placed CIC in conservatorship and\nproposed the rehabilitation plan pursuant to authority under\nsection 1011(c). \u201cThe statutory authority he exercises in that\neffort is an aspect of the police power of the state. It is\nsubstantial in its scope, but not boundless. Its basic parameters\nwere described by our Supreme Court over [85] years ago in\nCarpenter v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, 10 Cal.2d at page\n329: \u2018The only restriction on the exercise of this power is that the\nstate\u2019s action shall be reasonably related to the public interest\nand shall not be arbitrary or improperly discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d\n(Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th\n393, 398.) As the parties here both recognize, this has been held\nto require a trial court to review a commissioner\u2019s action \u201cunder\nthe abuse of discretion standard [citation]: was the action\narbitrary, i.e., unsupported by a rational basis, or is it contrary to\nspecific statute, a breach of the fiduciary duty of the conservator\nas trustee, or improperly discriminatory?\u201d (In re Executive Life\nIns. Co. (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 344, 358.) On appeal, \u201c[w]e also\ntest the action of the trial court by the abuse of discretion\nstandard. [Citation.] In this connection we employ the\nequivalent of the substantial evidence test by accepting the trial\ncourt\u2019s resolution of credibility and conflicting substantial\nevidence, and its choice of possible reasonable inferences.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\f III. Analysis\n CIC challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of the\nconservatorship in the first place, its refusal to vacate it, and its\napproval of the rehabilitation plan that would now end it. We\nconsider each argument in turn.\n A. Imposition of the conservatorship\n CIC contends the conservatorship was unlawfully imposed\nbecause there have never been any concerns about CIC\u2019s solvency\nor financial condition. 4 CIC\u2019s argument rests on the interplay of\nsection 1011, which authorizes conservatorships of insurers, and\nsections 1215.2, 1215.10, 1215.12, and 1215.16, which concern\nacquisitions or mergers of insurers. While CIC\u2019s argument is not\ncomplicated, to follow it one must first understand the operation\nof the relevant statutes.\n Section 1011 states that the \u201csuperior court of the county in\nwhich the principal office of a person [purporting to do insurance\nbusiness] is located, upon the filing by the commissioner of the\nverified application showing any of the conditions in this\nsubdivision exist, . . . shall issue its order vesting title to all of the\nassets of that person, wheresoever situated, in the commissioner\nor his or her successor in office, in his or her official capacity, and\n\n4 The commissioner argues in a footnote that CIC cannot\n\nargue that a conservation based on an unapproved attempt to\nmerge also requires the threat of insolvency because CIC did not\nraise that issue below. We need not respond to arguments raised\nonly in a footnote. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)\n43 Cal.App.5th 404, 419 [\u201cAn appellant cannot bury a substantive\nlegal argument in a footnote and hope to avoid waiver of that\nargument.\u201d].)\n\fdirect the commissioner . . . to conduct, as conservator, the\nbusiness of the person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011; see \u00a7 1010 [conservatorship\nstatutes apply to, among others, all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state\u201d].) The list of circumstances\nsupporting a conservatorship includes \u201c[t]hat the person, without\nfirst obtaining the consent in writing of the commissioner, has\ntransferred, or attempted to transfer, substantially its entire\nproperty or business or, without consent, has entered into any\ntransaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate, or\nreinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with\nthe property or business of any other person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011(c).) It also\nincludes the circumstance \u201c[t]hat the person is found, after an\nexamination, to be in a condition that makes its further\ntransaction of business hazardous to its policyholders, or\ncreditors, or to the public.\u201d (Id., subd. (d).) The Legislature\nenacted section 1011 in 1935, and the wording of these triggering\nconditions for a conservatorship remains substantively\nunchanged since then. (Stats. 1935, ch. 145, \u00a7 1011, p. 540.)\n In 1969, the Legislature added article 4.7 to division 1, part\n2, chapter 2 of the Insurance Code and titled it the \u201cInsurance\nHolding Company System Regulatory Act.\u201d (Stats. 1969,\nch. 1275, \u00a7 1, pp. 2487\u20132488.) As relevant here, section 1215.2,\nsubdivision (a) states, \u201cA person shall not make a tender offer for,\nor a request or invitation for tenders of, or enter into an\nagreement to exchange securities for or acquire in the open\nmarket, any voting security, or any security convertible into a\nvoting security, of a domestic insurer or of any other person\n\fcontrolling a domestic insurer, if the other person is not\nsubstantially engaged either directly or through its affiliates in\nany businesses other than that of insurance, if, as a result of the\nconsummation thereof, the person would, directly or indirectly,\nacquire control of the insurer, and a person shall not enter into\nan agreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer, unless, at the time copies of the offer, purchase,\nrequest, or invitation are first published, sent, or given to\nsecurity holders or the agreement or transaction is entered into,\nas the case may be, the person has filed with the commissioner,\nand has sent to the insurer, a statement containing\u201d certain\ninformation. The required disclosures include the backgrounds\nand identities of everyone on whose behalf the transaction is to\nbe effected; the source of the funds to be used; and any plans or\nproposals to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or merge it.\n(\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (a)(1)\u2013(5).)\n Section 1215.2, subdivision (d) states, \u201cThe purchases,\nexchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control referred to in\nsubdivision (a) may not be made until the commissioner approves\nthe purchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of\ncontrol. The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the\ntransaction on or before the latter of 60 days after the statement\nrequired by subdivision (a) has been filed with the commissioner\nor, if a hearing is held pursuant to subdivision (f), 30 days after\nthe close of the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f).\u201d The\nstatute then lists reasons why the commissioner may disapprove\nthe transaction. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d)(1)\u2013(5).)\n\f Section 1215.10, subdivision (a) allows the commissioner to\napply for an injunction when it appears to the commissioner that\nan insurer \u201chas committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nthe Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act. Section\n1215.12 states in full, \u201cWhenever it appears to the commissioner\nthat any person has committed a violation of this article which so\nimpairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to\nthreaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business\nby it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or\nthe public, then the commissioner may proceed as provided in\nArticle 14 (commencing with Section 1010) of Chapter 1 of this\npart to take possession of the property of the domestic insurer\nand to conduct the business thereof.\u201d Finally, section 1215.16\nstates in full, \u201cAll laws and parts of laws of this state inconsistent\nwith this article are hereby superseded with respect to matters\ncovered by this article.\u201d\n CIC\u2019s argument based on these statutes takes two forms,\neach of them straightforward. CIC first argues narrowly that the\ncommissioner\u2019s conservatorship application alleged violations of\nsection 1215.2 to justify the conservatorship, so the\ncommissioner\u2019s failure to identify any financial impairment\nmeans his application did not satisfy section 1215.12\u2019s\nrequirements for a conservatorship. This is incorrect. The first\nsentence of the commissioner\u2019s application states that the\napplication rests on section 1011. The application later alleges\nrepeatedly that Menzies\u2019 attempt to merge CIC with CIC II\njustified a conservatorship under section 1011. The\n\fcommissioner unambiguously relied on his authority under\nsection 1011, not section 1215.12. The application does further\nallege that the attempted merger without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval also violated section 1215.2. But these further\nallegations do not undermine or disclaim the reliance on section\n1011, so the commissioner\u2019s application properly relied on his\nauthority under that statute.\n CIC also argues more broadly that the Legislature limited\nthe reach of section 1011(c) \u2014 which CIC terms a historic,\ngeneral statutory provision \u2014 when it enacted what CIC calls the\nspecific, remedial structure for unauthorized mergers in article\n4.7. CIC contends that by specifying in section 1215.12 that the\ncommissioner can impose a conservatorship under section 1011\nand related statutes for an unauthorized merger that \u201cso impairs\nthe financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten\ninsolvency or make the further transaction of business by it\nhazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the\npublic\u201d and enacting section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision, the\nLegislature repealed the broader authorization of\nconservatorships in section 1011(c) for any unauthorized merger.\nAccording to CIC, if an authorized merger does not so impair the\nfinancial condition of an insurer that it threatens insolvency or\nmakes the operation of the insurer hazardous, then the\ncommissioner may not impose a conservatorship and may only\npursue injunctive relief.\n We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended section\n1215.16 to expressly repeal section 1011(c), as CIC contends.\n\fMost obviously, section 1011 remains in effect; the bill that\nenacted sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 did not repeal section\n1011(c). Section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision is not to the\ncontrary. Section 1215.12 invokes the conservatorship\nproceedings under section 1010 and following sections, so the\nLegislature intended those statutes to remain in effect. It would\nbe strange for the Legislature to allow section 1011(c) to remain\nin force, authorizing a conservatorship whenever an insurer\nattempts to merge its business without permission, while\nobliquely limiting it through sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 to\nauthorize a conservatorship only when a merger creates a risk of\nfinancial impairment. It would be particularly strange to do so\nwhile leaving section 1011, subdivision (d) in effect, which\nauthorizes a conservatorship whenever an insurer is found to be\nin a hazardous condition. A far more natural method of\nachieving the purpose that CIC ascribes to the Legislature would\nhave been to add the requirement of financial impairment to\nsection 1011(c), but the Legislature did not do this.\n Although CIC protests that section 1215.16 makes this a\nquestion of express repeal, in actuality CIC\u2019s argument is one of\nimplied repeal. \u201cRepeals by implication are disfavored.\u201d (Lopez\nv. Sony Electronics, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 627, 637.)\n\u201c \u2018Notwithstanding the \u201cpresumption against repeals by\nimplication,\u201d repeal may be found where (1) \u201cthe two acts are so\ninconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation,\u201d\nor (2) \u201cthe later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent\nto supersede the earlier\u201d provision.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because \u201cthe\n\fdoctrine of implied repeal provides that the most recently enacted\nstatute expresses the will of the Legislature\u201d [citation],\napplication of the doctrine is appropriate in those limited\nsituations where it is necessary to effectuate the intent of\ndrafters of the newly enacted statute. \u201c \u2018In order for the second\nlaw to repeal or supersede the first, the former must constitute a\nrevision of the entire subject, so that the court may say that it\nwas intended to be a substitute for the first.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Wishnev v. The\nNorthwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. (2019) 8 Cal.5th 199, 211.)\n As the commissioner points out, section 1215.12 is easy to\nharmonize with section 1011(c). The conservatorship statutes,\nincluding section 1011, apply to all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1010.) Section 1011(c)\nallows for a conservatorship of an insurer based on an attempted\nmerger without requiring a showing of insolvency or financial\nhazard.\n Section 1215.12, meanwhile, applies to a broader group\nthan just insurers, but allows for conservatorships in narrower\ncircumstances. Section 1215.12 allows the commissioner to place\nan insurer in a conservatorship when it appears to the\ncommissioner that \u201cany person\u201d has violated section 1215.2 or\nother statutes in a way that impairs the financial condition of an\ninsurer that threatens insolvency or makes the insurer\u2019s further\noperation hazardous. Section 1215.2, subdivision (a), among\nother things, prohibits a \u201cperson\u201d from making a tender offer or\nrequesting or inviting tenders for securities of an insurer or a\n\u201cperson\u201d controlling an insurer, or from \u201center[ing] into an\n\fagreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer\u201d unless, when the offer, request, or agreement is\nmade, the required information has been filed with the\ncommissioner. Section 1215.2 further provides that such\n\u201cpurchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control\u201d\nmay not be made without the commissioner\u2019s approval. (Id.,\nsubd. (d).) \u201cPerson\u201d is defined for both of these sections to include\nany individual or other entity. (\u00a7 1215, subd. (m).) Because\nsection 1215.12 applies to non-insurers and prohibits anyone\nfrom even offering to buy an insurer without satisfying the\nstatutory requirements, it makes sense that the Legislature\nwould limit conservatorships based on violations of such\nrequirements to those that threaten the solvency or safe\noperation of the insurer.\n The Legislature\u2019s limitation of the scope of the remedy for\nits new requirements applicable to non-insurers does not mean\nthat it also intended to limit the scope of the existing remedy\napplicable only to insurers. When an insurer violates section\n1215.2 by agreeing to merge, as CIC did, it triggers the provision\nin section 1011(c), even if that agreement did not also trigger\nsection 1215.12 because it did not threaten the insurer\u2019s solvency\nor make its continued operation hazardous. Because sections\n1215.2 and 1215.12 are not incompatible with section 1011(c),\nevince no intent to supersede section 1011(c), and did not revise\nthe entire subject of conservatorships of insurers, but rather\nadded a more limited conservatorship remedy for a broader set of\n\factors, we hold that section 1215.2 and 1215.12 did not expressly\nor impliedly repeal section 1011(c).\n CIC contends that the commissioner has only ever invoked\nsection 1011(c) for insurers in financial distress and cites various\ncases describing section 1011 conservatorships as the state\nequivalent of bankruptcy law for insurers. (E.g., State of\nCalifornia v. Altus Finance (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1295 [\u00a7 1011\n\u201cis part of . . . article 14,\u201d which \u201crelate[s] to the Commissioner\u2019s\ntreatment of insolvent insurers\u201d and is the \u201cequivalent of federal\nbankruptcy laws\u201d]; Financial Indemnity Co. v. Superior Court of\nLos Angeles (1955) 45 Cal.2d 395, 402 [\u201cThe primary purpose for\nthe drastic remedy [of conservatorship] . . . is to prevent\ndissipation of the assets of the company after the commissioner\nhas determined that a hazardous condition exists.\u201d].)\n We agree that this case appears to be the first decision\ndealing with a conservatorship involving an insurer not in\nfinancial distress. However, the absence of a precedent directly\non point demonstrates only that before CIC, solvent insurers\nwere careful to obtain the necessary approval before placing their\nbusiness at risk of conservatorship. While the conservatorship\nsystem does replace the bankruptcy system for insurers, who are\nexcluded from federal bankruptcy, that does not mean that only\nbankrupt or insolvent insurers can be placed under\nconservatorship. As our Supreme Court explained long ago in\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 329, \u201cIt is no longer open to\nquestion that the business of insurance is affected with a public\ninterest\u201d because \u201c[i]nsurance is a public asset, a basis of credit,\n\fand a vital factor in business activity.\u201d Carpenter involved an\ninsolvent insurer, but given the role insurance plays in the\neconomy and society, the public\u2019s interest in insurers and the\ninsurance industry extends beyond insolvency to ensuring that\ninsurers follow statutes and regulations enacted to protect\npolicyholders and the public.\n The plain language of section 1011(c) permits a\nconservatorship based on an attempted unauthorized merger\neven when the insurer involved is solvent, and it is not absurd for\nthe Legislature to intend to prohibit insurers from merging\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s consent, regardless of solvency\nquestions. We therefore follow the statute\u2019s plain language.\n(People v. Velador (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 687, 693 [if statutory\nlanguage is clear, courts must follow its plain meaning unless it\nwould result in absurd consequences that the Legislature did not\nintend].)\n B. Maintenance of the conservatorship\n CIC argues that even if the commissioner properly placed\nCIC under conservatorship based only on the attempted merger,\nthe commissioner and the trial court abused their discretion by\nnot vacating the conservatorship on CIC\u2019s motion when CIC\nagreed to an injunction prohibiting it from completing the\nmerger. CIC contends its offer to stipulate to an injunction made\nthe conservatorship unnecessary. It further contends the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to vacate the injunction failed to account for\nvarious facts, including that the merger was only necessary to\nsatisfy the Berkshire Hathaway deadline after the commissioner\n\frefused to approve or disapprove Menzies\u2019 application to acquire\nCIC due to concerns about the RPA litigation. CIC also asserts\nthat the department appeared at the New Mexico merger hearing\nand did not object, CIC complied when the commissioner asked it\nnot to file the certificate with the Secretary of State to complete\nthe merger in California, the commissioner failed to raise any\nconcerns about the RPA litigation during its consideration of\nMenzies\u2019 application to acquire CIC until days before the\nBerkshire Hathaway deadline, and CIC\u2019s assets and capital were\nmore than sufficient to address the maximum exposure from the\nRPA litigation.\n We reject CIC\u2019s argument for the same reasons that the\nNinth Circuit rejected the similar argument that the\nconservatorship proceeding was brought in bad faith. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th 579.) As the Ninth\nCircuit explained, \u201cthe conservatorship action was brought for a\nlegitimate reason \u2014 indeed, [CIC\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019] own factual\nallegations make out a violation of \u00a7 1215.2(d) sufficient to\ntrigger a conservatorship under \u00a7 1011(c). The allegations make\nclear that [CIC and its affiliates] neither sought nor received\napproval from the [department] for the proposed purchase of the\ncontrolling interest in CIC I and the concomitant CIC I / CIC II\nmerger, as required by California Insurance Code \u00a7 1215.2(d),\nand that the merger was an obvious attempt to avoid the\nCalifornia insurance regulatory regime.\u201d (Id. at p. 597.) Given\nthat CIC created the RPA with the express intent of bypassing\nstate insurance regulations limiting the marketing of\n\fretrospective rating policies, the commissioner determined that\nthe RPA was unlawful and void, and that CIC attempted to\nmerge with an out-of-state entity a matter of days after the\ncommissioner raised concerns about CIC\u2019s litigation of suits\nbased on the void RPA, the commissioner could reasonably\ndetermine that it was necessary to place CIC under\nconservatorship to prevent CIC from pursuing any further\nschemes to dodge or stymie the commissioner\u2019s oversight, despite\nthe offer to stipulate to an injunction.\n The various facts that CIC cites, even if true, are beside the\npoint. Fundamentally, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, Menzies\n\u201cmade a $50 million bet with Berkshire Hathaway . . . that he\ncould complete the purchase of Berkshire [Hathaway]\u2019s\ncontrolling interest in CIC I by September 30, 2019.\u201d (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 584.) The\ndeadline was not of the commissioner\u2019s making. Menzies lost the\nbet when the commissioner failed to approve the transaction by\nthe deadline Berkshire Hathaway set. The answer, then, was for\nMenzies to pay his loss by forfeiting the breakup fee (ibid.), not\nfor Menzies and CIC to try to seek to complete the transaction\nanyway by hurriedly redomesticating CIC within less than two\nweeks by merging with a newly created out-of-state entity\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s approval. Given CIC\u2019s demonstrated\nwillingness to flout the law for its own financial gain, the trial\ncourt and by extension the commissioner did not abuse their\ndiscretion by concluding that a conservatorship was necessary to\n\fensure CIC\u2019s compliance with the law, rather than acceding to\nCIC\u2019s preferred course of a stipulated injunction.\n This case is comparable in this regard to Caminetti v.\nGuaranty Union Life Ins. Co. (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 330. The\ncommissioner there placed an insurer in conservatorship because\nthe insurer\u2019s management was paying itself excessive salaries\nthat placed the insurer in a hazardous condition. (Id. at pp. 332\u2013\n335.) The insurer later argued that the trial court should have\nterminated the conservatorship because the insurer removed the\ngrounds for the conservatorship by voluntarily reducing the\nmanagement\u2019s salaries. (Id. at pp. 335\u2013336.) The Court of\nAppeal noted that the same management remained in control\nand found that the trial court or commissioner would only be\nwarranted in returning the company back to the management\u2019s\ncontrol if there was evidence that their state of mind had\nchanged. (Id. at p. 336.) The Court of Appeal deferred to the\ntrial court\u2019s conclusion, after taking evidence, that the\nmanagement \u201cshould not again be permitted to control the\ndestinies of the policyholders.\u201d (Ibid.) So, too, here, the court and\nthe commissioner would only have been obligated to terminate\nthe conservatorship if there were evidence that CIC\u2019s\nmanagement had changed its state of mind. We defer to the trial\ncourt\u2019s view that the stipulation to an injunction was insufficient,\ngiven the other evidence of CIC\u2019s intentionally evasive behavior.\n C. Rehabilitation plan to end the conservatorship\n CIC\u2019s remaining arguments challenge the terms of the\ncommissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan pursuant to which CIC can\n\fexit conservatorship, complete its merger with CIC II, and\nredomesticate in New Mexico.\n A conservatorship under section 1011 \u201ccontemplates, not\nthe liquidation of the company involved, but a conservation of the\nassets and business of the company over the period of stress by\nthe commissioner who thereafter yields the control and direction\nto the regular officers of the company.\u201d (Caminetti v. Superior\nCourt (1941) 16 Cal.2d 838, 843.) Section 1012 sets out the terms\nfor ending a conservatorship under section 1011. It states that\nwith one exception not relevant here, a conservatorship order\n\u201cshall continue in force and effect until, on the application either\nof the commissioner or of [the insurer under conservatorship], it\nshall, after a full hearing, appear to the court that the ground for\nthe order directing the commissioner to take title and possession\ndoes not exist or has been removed and that the person can\nproperly resume title and possession of its property and the\nconduct of its business.\u201d (\u00a7 1012.) \u201cIn order to effect\nrehabilitation, the Commissioner may enter into a court-\napproved rehabilitation agreement.\u201d (State of California v. Altus\nFinance, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1295; accord, \u00a7 1043 [\u201cthe\ncommissioner, as conservator or as liquidator, may, subject to the\napproval of said court, . . . mutualize or reinsure the business of\nsuch person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements\u201d]; Carpenter,\nsupra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 323 [\u201cwhen the commissioner files a\npetition to be appointed conservator and asks authority to work\nout a rehabilitation plan,\u201d the proceeding lasts \u201cuntil the\nproposed plan is ultimately passed upon\u201d].)\n\f Section 1043 does not delineate the scope of the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to enter into rehabilitation agreements,\nbut that authority is presumed to be limited by the provisions in\nthe other statutes governing the conservatorship proceedings in\nsections 1010\u20131062. (Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court,\nsupra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 410.) One such statute is section\n1037, which lists various powers the commissioner has as the\nconservator of an insurer. Section 1037, subdivision (c) (section\n1037(c)) states that the commissioner \u201c[s]hall have authority to\ncompound, compromise or in any other manner negotiate\nsettlements of claims against that person upon such terms and\nconditions as the commissioner shall deem to be most\nadvantageous to the estate of the person being administered or\nliquidated or otherwise dealt with under this article.\u201d\n Because CIC sought to merge with an out-of-state entity\nand redomesticate in New Mexico, sections 1071.5 and 1072 are\nalso relevant here. Section 1071.5 states, \u201cEvery insurer which\nwithdraws as an insurer, or is required to withdraw as an\ninsurer, from this State shall, prior to such withdrawal, discharge\nits liabilities to residents of this State. In the case of its policies\ninsuring residents of this State it shall cause the primary\nliabilities under such policies to be reinsured and assumed by\nanother admitted insurer. In the case of such policies as are\nsubject to cancellation by the insurer, it may cancel such policies\npursuant to the terms thereof in lieu of such reinsurance and\nassumption.\u201d Section 1072 provides that if the commissioner\nexamines the books and records of a withdrawing insurer and\n\fdetermines that \u201cthe insurer has no outstanding liabilities to\nresidents of this State and no policies in favor of the residents of\nthis State uncanceled or the primary liabilities under which have\nnot been reinsured and assumed by another admitted insurer, as\nrequired by Section 1071.5, he shall cancel the insurer\u2019s\ncertificates of authority, if unexpired, and he shall permit the\ninsurer to withdraw. The commissioner may, in his discretion,\nwaive any or all of the above requirements if, after such\nexamination, he finds it to be in a solvent condition.\u201d\n 1. Section 2.6\u2019s settlement of the RPA litigation\n a. Relationship to basis for conservatorship\n CIC offers multiple reasons why the provision of the\nrehabilitation plan allowing CIC\u2019s policyholders to settle their\nclaims against CIC is legally unauthorized, but none has merit.\nMost generally, CIC contends the RPA litigation was not the\nbasis for the conservatorship and settlement of the RPA litigation\nis therefore not necessary to address the reasons for the\nconservatorship. The commissioner disputes whether section\n1012 requires each aspect of a rehabilitation plan to be limited to\nthe original grounds for the conservatorship, pointing out that\nsection 1012 states that a conservatorship ends when the court\nconcludes that the circumstances that gave rise to it no longer\nexist \u201cand that the person can properly resume title and\npossession of its property and the conduct of its business.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1012, italics added.) But he also maintains that settlement of\n\fthe RPA litigation is related to the grounds for the\nconservatorship.\n The language of section 1012 is broad, and the second\nclause is written in the present tense, suggesting that the\ncommissioner can include in a rehabilitation plan provisions\naimed at remediating flaws or issues he discovers in the\nconserved insurer during the course of the conservatorship that\nare not related to the reason for the conservatorship. But we\nneed not come to a definitive conclusion on this question.\nAssuming for the sake of argument that CIC is correct and a\nrehabilitation plan can only address the reasons for a\nconservatorship, the trial court and the commissioner reasonably\nconcluded that settlement of the RPA litigation does so. 5\n CIC attempted to merge without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval and depart the state because the commissioner refused\nto approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition of CIC. The Ninth Circuit\nrecently concluded as much, noting that Menzies merged CIC\nwith CIC II \u201cto bypass the California insurance regulatory regime\naltogether\u201d (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th\nat pp. 584\u2013585) \u201cand that the merger was an obvious attempt to\navoid the California insurance regulatory regime\u201d (id. at p. 597).\nThe commissioner refused to approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition\n\n5 CIC argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the second\n\ncondition in section 1012 for termination of a conservatorship,\nthat the insurer can properly resume title and possession of its\nbusiness, violates state administrative law and due process.\nBecause we do not rely on this aspect of section 1012 to affirm the\ntrial court\u2019s order, we need not examine these arguments.\n\fbecause of concerns about the RPA litigation. If the\ncommissioner had not placed CIC in conservatorship, CIC could\nhave merged, thereby thwarting the commissioner\u2019s ability to\nsatisfy himself regarding CIC\u2019s liability under the RPA litigation.\nEnding the conservatorship without also addressing the\ncommissioner\u2019s concerns about the RPA litigation therefore would\nhave failed to remedy the motivation behind it. CIC asserts that\nthe merger was intended only to avoid collapse of the Berkshire\nHathaway deal due to the commissioner\u2019s refusal to approve or\ndisapprove the transaction, but its account ignores the substance\nof why that deal almost collapsed.\n b. Mandated departure\n CIC objects that its departure from California cannot\njustify section 2.6 because its departure is not voluntary but\nrather mandated by section 2.4 of the plan. 6 CIC did not object to\nsection 2.4 in the trial court and does not object to it on appeal, so\nthis argument is not well taken. CIC\u2019s claims about a mandated\ndeparture also belie the history of this case. CIC began the\nprocess of merging with CIC II and redomesticating to allow the\nBerkshire Hathaway transaction to close. The Berkshire\nHathaway transaction did close, which was one of the New\n\n6 Section 2.4 of the rehabilitation plan states that on the\n\ndate the reinsurance and assumption agreement takes effect, the\ncommissioner as conservator \u201cshall effectuate the merger of CIC\ninto and with\u201d CIC II, \u201cthereby completing the attempted\nredomestication of CIC from California to New Mexico, and upon\nthe effective date of the merger of CIC into and with CIC II and\nthe transfer of the domicile of CIC to New Mexico, CIC shall\ncease to be a California domestic insurer.\u201d\n\fMexico superintendent\u2019s conditions of approval of the merger.\nCIC II also satisfied the other condition, which was that CIC II\nfile articles of merger with the New Mexico secretary of state. All\nthat remains is the filing of the certificate of merger with the\nCalifornia secretary of state. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) It is\nthus more accurate to say that sections 2.4 and 2.6 of the\nrehabilitation plan place conditions on the completion of the\ndeparture that is already under way.\n Given that CIC began the departure process without the\ncommissioner\u2019s approval and it is partly complete, the\ncommissioner is within his rights to place conditions on the\ncompletion of the departure. When an insurer follows the normal\nprocedure for withdrawal from the state by filing an application\nand surrendering its certificate to the commissioner (\u00a7 1070), the\n\u201cinsurer who has commenced the withdrawal process may not\nunilaterally terminate it and the Commissioner may condition\ntermination of the withdrawal process on appropriate remedial\naction by the insurer.\u201d (Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Gillespie\n(1990) 50 Cal.3d 82, 102 (Gillespie).) The commissioner must\nhave the same or greater authority over an insurer who is placed\nin conservatorship for attempting to extinguish its certificate\nthrough a merger and departure without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. (See \u00a7 701 [an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority \u201cshall\nexpire with the expiration or termination of a corporate existence\nof the holder thereof\u201d].)\n\f c. Statutory basis\n According to CIC, section 1071.5, which the trial court cited\nas authority supporting section 2.6, is inapplicable for several\nreasons, including that the RPA litigation claims are not\n\u201cliabilities\u201d of CIC within the meaning of section 1071.5 and\nrequiring it to settle litigation as a condition of withdrawing from\nthe state would violate its constitutional rights.\n CIC\u2019s interpretation of section 1071.5 is dubious, but we\nneed not examine CIC\u2019s contentions in detail because the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to fashion the rehabilitation plan does\nnot depend on section 1071.5. Section 1071.5 governs an\ninsurer\u2019s withdrawal from the state, so if CIC were simply trying\nto withdraw then section 1071.5 would govern. But CIC is not\nlike most withdrawing insurers. It is under conservatorship.\nSection 1037(c), which the trial court cited as supporting section\n2.6, allows the commissioner as conservator of an insurer to\n\u201ccompromise or in any other manner negotiate settlements of\nclaims against\u201d the conserved insurer. Sections 1012 and 1043\nalso empower the commissioner to enter into rehabilitation\nagreements to end a conservatorship. The commissioner\nreasonably concluded that settlement of the RPA litigation was\nnecessary to end the condition that gave rise to the\nconservatorship, as we concluded ante, so sections 1012, 1043,\nand 1037(c) provide sufficient authorization to support section\n2.6.\n CIC resists application of section 1037(c), arguing that\nstatute gives the commissioner authority to settle cases during\n\fthe conservatorship, not as a condition of exiting it. This gets\nthings backwards. As CIC itself notes, Commercial Nat. Bank v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at page 410 recognized\nthat the commissioner can reasonably exercise the state\u2019s police\npower and has authority under section 1043 to enter into\nrehabilitation agreements, subject to limitations in the other\nstatutes dealing with conservatorships. If section 1037(c)\nauthorizes settlements, that is no reason to think section 1043\ndoes not. CIC fails to show that the commissioner\u2019s section 1043\nauthority to use settlements to fashion a rehabilitation plan is\nnarrower than his section 1037(c) settlement authority during a\nconservatorship.\n d. Claims against affiliates\n CIC notes that section 1037(c) allows the commissioner as\nconservator to settle \u201cclaims against that person\u201d being\nconserved. It then argues that the RPA litigation mostly consists\nof claims against CIC\u2019s affiliates, not CIC itself. However, the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority in a conservatorship is not limited to\nthe entity being conserved. (Garamendi v. Executive Life Ins. Co.\n(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 504, 520, 523 (Garamendi).) A trial court\nmay assert in rem jurisdiction over assets of entities that have an\n\u201cidentity of interest\u201d with a conserved insurer and include them\nwithin the scope of the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan for an\ninsurer if it is reasonably necessary to promote the insurer\u2019s\nrehabilitation. (Ibid.) Garamendi relied in part on the fact that\ninsurance conservatorships are a state law equivalent of\nbankruptcy and that federal bankruptcy law asserts jurisdiction\n\fover entities that are legally separate from the debtor where\nnecessary to the successful administration of a debtor\u2019s estate.\n(Id. at pp. 515\u2013517.) But Garamendi also emphasized that \u201cthe\nbusiness of insurance is affected with a public interest,\u201d\n\u201cinsurance is a public asset,\u201d and creditors, policyholders, and the\npublic have an important stake in preserving the business of\ninsurers. (Id. at pp. 515\u2013516.)\n As the trial court ruled, Garamendi\u2019s holding supports\nsection 2.6 of the plan here. While there is no indication that CIC\nis insolvent, the commissioner\u2019s authority springs from the same\nstatutes that allow conservatorships in cases of insolvency and\nthe public has an interest in regulation and legally sound\noperation of insurers like CIC. CIC is correct that neither the\ncommissioner nor the trial court found that CIC\u2019s affiliates were\nalter egos of CIC, and the relationship between CIC and its\naffiliates is not exactly the same as the entities at issue in\nGaramendi. But nothing in Garamendi conditioned its assertion\nof in rem jurisdiction on an alter ego finding, and its rationale\nbased on the public interest in insurers also applies here.\n(Garamendi, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 516\u2013520, 523.)\n CIC and its affiliates operated the RPA and EquityComp\nprograms as a joint enterprise, dividing obligations and authority\nfor the express purpose of avoiding regulation by the\ncommissioner, as the commissioner found in Shasta Linen and as\nother courts have concluded. (E.g., Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1116\u20131117 [agreeing with Shasta Linen\nthat CIC and its affiliates \u201cwere \u2018so enmeshed\u2019 and \u2018intertwined\u2019\n\fthat they should be considered together in determining whether\nthe RPA constitutes a modification of the CIC policies\u201d]; Luxor\nCabs, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 986 [viewing \u201cEquityComp as a\nsingle, integrated insurance program\u201d despite the distinctions\nbetween CIC and its affiliates]; Applied Underwriters, Inc. v.\nLara, supra, 37 F.4th at pp. 592\u2013593 [discussing Garamendi with\napproval].) As one of these courts noted, \u201cObviously, allowing an\ninsurer to circumvent the comprehensive regulatory structure\napplicable to the issuance of workers\u2019 compensation insurance in\nthis state simply by amending its approved policy forms through\na side agreement with a subsidiary is contrary to the public\npolicy underlying California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law and\ncannot be countenanced.\u201d (Luxor Cabs, at p. 986.) The RPA\nlitigation has reflected this integrated relationship between CIC\nand its affiliates, since in at least one case, a federal court\naffirmed an arbitration award requiring a policyholder to pay\npremiums to CIC, over the policyholder\u2019s objection that CIC was\nnot a party to the arbitration. (American, Etc., Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (N.D. Cal. Dec. 28,\n2017, No. 17-cv-03660 DMR) 2017 WL 6622993, at *3\u2013*5.) In\nthese circumstances, excluding the RPA litigation from the\nrehabilitation plan because plaintiffs sued one of the other\nentities involved in the joint EquityComp program besides CIC\nwould thwart the commissioner\u2019s authority to remedy the\nproblem that gave rise to the conservatorship.\n\f e. Most advantageous terms\n CIC contends that section 1037(c) only allows settlement of\nclaims \u201cupon such terms and conditions as the commissioner\nshall deem to be most advantageous to the estate of the person\nbeing administered\u201d (\u00a7 1037(c)) and asserts the trial court did not\nfind that section 2.6\u2019s three settlement options are to CIC\u2019s\nadvantage.\n CIC\u2019s statement of the standard governing settlements by\nan insurance conservator is incomplete. While section 1037(c)\nrequires settlements to be most advantageous to the estate,\nsection 1057 declares that when acting as a conservator, \u201cthe\ncommissioner shall be deemed to be a trustee for the benefit of all\ncreditors and other persons interested in the estate of the person\nagainst whom the proceedings are pending.\u201d And as In re\nExecutive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at page 376\nexplained, the commissioner\u2019s actions are also inflected with the\npublic interest, given the character of insurance and that the\ncommissioner \u201cacts not only as a trustee but also as a servant of\nthe state in the exercise of its police power.\u201d \u201cOf necessity, if\nrequired to satisfy the public interest, the Commissioner\npossesses considerable discretion in settling claims.\u201d (Id. at\np. 381.) Thus, when deciding whether a settlement of claims\nagainst a conserved insurer is \u201cboth in the best interest of the\nconservancy estate and necessary to vindicate the public interest\u201d\n(ibid.), the commissioner must consider not just the insurer itself,\nbut also others interested in the insurer, such as policyholders or\ncreditors, as well as the public interest at stake. Additionally,\n\feven when a settlement of one claim cannot be justified on its\nown, it may be justified if it is part of a global settlement or\ncontributes to a near global settlement. (Id. at p. 382.)\n The trial court quoted In re Executive Life Ins. Co.\u2019s\nstatement of the standard for settlements, described how section\n2.6 offered the possibility of a settlement of the substantial\nmajority of the RPA litigation, described in detail the substantial\nevidence supporting the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that CIC faced\nsignificant legal exposure in the litigation, and found section 2.6\nhad a rational basis in its entirety. The import of the trial court\u2019s\ndecision is that the commissioner reasonably concluded the\nsection 2.6 settlement options were most advantageous to the\npublic interest and the estate because of CIC\u2019s potential liability.\n Regarding CIC\u2019s potential liability, the trial court found\nsubstantial evidence supported the commissioner\u2019s belief that the\nRPA was void. Section 2.6\u2019s first settlement option reflects this\npossibility, since it would allow policyholders to settle by paying\nonly what they owe under the guaranteed cost policy. The trial\ncourt recognized that policyholders could also enforce the RPA,\ndespite its illegality, to prevent unjust enrichment to CIC.\nSection 2.6\u2019s third settlement option represents this possibility,\nsince it would allow policyholders to enforce the guaranteed cost\npolicies and the RPA in full, which might result in a payment to\nCIC.\n The trial court found that CIC could also be liable under\nthe Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.\n(UCL)) for engaging in unlawful acts based on the failure to file\n\fthe RPA for approval, unfair acts by using an unfiled insurance\npolicy that was not disclosed until after the policyholders were\nalready bound, and fraudulent practices by misrepresenting the\nEquityComp plan in marketing materials. The trial court found\nsection 2.6\u2019s second settlement option \u2014 which would allow\npolicyholders to obtain restitution of any amounts they paid over\nthe cost of a standard, approved retrospective rating plan \u2014 to be\na reasonable approach to calculating quantum meruit restitution,\nwhich would be a remedy for UCL violations.\n CIC does not mention, let alone dispute, any of the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions regarding its potential liability under these\ntheories. Instead, it contends that a global settlement is not to\nCIC\u2019s advantage and violates its due process rights because CIC\ndefeated all attempts to certify classes of policyholders, the\nsettlement would prevent CIC from challenging each plaintiff\u2019s\nevidence, and it would require CIC to forfeit potentially\nmeritorious individual defenses, including showing that a\nplaintiff had suffered no damages. CIC also points out that its\nShasta Linen settlement with the department acknowledged that\nthe legality of the RPA was \u201cfor the courts to decide\u201d and asserts\nthat it prevailed in RPA litigation on numerous grounds.\n We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s and\ncommissioner\u2019s conclusions that CIC faces significant enough\nliability under the RPA litigation that it is most advantageous to\nCIC, policyholders, creditors, and the public for the commissioner\nto offer to settle on the terms in section 2.6. (See In re Executive\nLife Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 358 [courts must affirm\n\frehabilitation plan if it is not arbitrary, discriminatory, contrary\nto a specific statute, or a breach of the conservator\u2019s fiduciary\nduty as trustee].)\n The Shasta Linen settlement\u2019s statement about the courts\ndeciding the legality of the RPA is of no consequence, since it\npredated CIC\u2019s attempted unauthorized merger to evade the\ncommissioner\u2019s consideration of the RPA litigation and the\nresulting conservatorship. The settlement also reserved the\ncommissioner\u2019s right to \u201cinitiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d Nothing in the settlement precludes section\n2.6.\n The trial court considered CIC\u2019s claim of substantial\nsuccess in the RPA litigation and reasonably found it\nunpersuasive. CIC did prevail in defeating class certification\nmotions, but those rulings have no bearing on the merits of any\nindividual policyholder\u2019s claims. The fact that the RPA litigants\nwere unable to satisfy the procedural requirements for class\naction due to individualized issues, as CIC asserts, is irrelevant\nto deciding whether the global settlement and the application of\nthe three settlement options is in CIC\u2019s interest. Section 2.6 does\nnot vitiate CIC\u2019s class certification victories in any event. The\npolicyholders eligible to settle under section 2.6 are those who\nalready filed claims, those whom CIC identifies as potentially\nowing CIC payments, and ten policyholders who had already\n\fsubmitted claims to the conservator. CIC does not contend that\nthese categories encompass the same number of policyholders\nthat a class action would have.\n Apart from class certification motions, the victories CIC\ncites primarily concern enforcement of arbitrability delegation or\nforum selection clauses in courts in other states or piecemeal\ndismissals of individual causes of action. These limited successes\ndo not show that CIC has a strong likelihood of ultimately\ndefeating policyholders\u2019 suits as a whole. The record as a whole\ncontains substantial evidence that policyholders prevailed more\noften in showing the RPA, or portions of it, to be void and\nunenforceable, especially after the issuance of the Court of\nAppeal decisions beginning with Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th 1096. CIC points out that the Court of Appeal\ndecisions the trial court cited concern the enforceability of the\narbitration agreement within the RPA, rather than the RPA\nitself. (E.g., id. at p. 1121, fn. 6 [decision was limited to factual\nrecord on the hearing on motion to compel and did not preclude\nparties from litigating merits of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action\nregarding the RPA].) This argument ignores that the same\ngrounds for invalidating an arbitration agreement within a\ncontract can provide a stronger basis for invalidating the entire\ncontract. (Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S.\n63, 71 [\u201cIn some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the\ncontract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the\nsame basis as applied only to the severable agreement to\n\farbitrate\u201d].) Moreover, other decisions the commissioner cited\ndeclared the entire RPA invalid.\n CIC notes that some decisions have found a policyholder\nliable for unpaid premiums regardless of the RPA\u2019s illegality.\n(E.g., Applied Underwriting, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb.\nAug. 2, 2018, No. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4.)\nAgain, there are decisions going the other direction.\nAdditionally, litigation of many of the cases was stayed because\nof the initiation of the conservatorship. Given that the\nEquityComp system was structured as a combination of the\nguaranteed cost policies and the RPA and that the commissioner\nsupplied an actuary\u2019s opinion that CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npremiums were roughly 33 percent higher than market rates, the\ntrial court could reasonably conclude that courts or arbitrators in\nthe future (including appellate courts, in cases where CIC had\nprevailed or would likely prevail in a lower court) would find it\nunfair and inequitable to enforce just the guaranteed cost plan\nrates after finding the RPA to be illegal. 7\n\n7 CIC disputes the 33 percent figure, claiming the actuary\n\nonly said in his deposition that the 33 percent figure was his\n\u201cimpression\u201d and relied on no data. CIC also notes that it\nprovided an actuarial expert\u2019s analysis that found CIC\u2019s rates\nwere in the middle of the market. But the department\u2019s actuary\nexplained elsewhere that CIC\u2019s rates were based on the loss\ntrends of its policy portfolio and those loss trends were higher\nthan the loss trends for the industry as a whole. The department\nalso noted in its reply that CIC\u2019s actuarial analysis was based on\nfiled rates, not the rates CIC actually charged, and did not reflect\nthat CIC\u2019s rates were higher than the industry-wide average\ndespite CIC not insuring policyholders with the highest losses.\n\f In short, the evidence from CIC and the commissioner\ndemonstrates at best that CIC has had limited success in the\nRPA litigation. This is not sufficient to show an abuse of\ndiscretion by the trial court or commissioner in finding section\n2.6\u2019s settlement options to be most advantageous to CIC\u2019s estate\nand interested third parties. Considering California\u2019s strong\npublic policy favoring the settlement of disputes (Rheinhart v.\nNissan North America, Inc. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1027)\nand the costs of litigation, the trial court could reasonably\ndetermine that settlement was beneficial to CIC here, especially\nbecause it would expedite the end of the conservatorship.\nAdditionally, settlement of a claim that may not be justified on\nits own can be justified as part of a global or near-global\nsettlement. (In re Executive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 382.) Even if CIC might have defeated some of the RPA\ncases on the merits based on individualized defenses or had a net\nrecovery after some plaintiffs\u2019 damages were offset against\npremiums still owing to CIC or its affiliates, the trial court and\ncommissioner reasonably decided that it was most advantageous\nto achieve a near-global settlement, with the resulting litigation\ncost savings, by offering the three settlement options in section\n2.6.\n\nThe department\u2019s analysis constitutes substantial evidence, so\nthe trial court was entitled to decide which of these competing\nanalyses it found most persuasive.\n\f f. More favorable settlement\n CIC challenges option 2 specifically as offering RPA\nplaintiffs a more favorable outcome than they could have\nobtained through litigation because it calculates the fair market\nvalue of the benefits under the EquityComp plan by using a\ngeneral retrospective rating plan rather than one that CIC\noffered. Option 2 represents the commissioner\u2019s attempt to use a\ngeneric retrospective policy approved by the commissioner to\ncalculate the fair market value of the coverage a policyholder\nreceived from CIC, which CIC would be entitled to retain under\nthe UCL even if a plaintiff prevailed. As the trial court noted,\nfair market value is commonly defined as that amount \u201cthat\n\u2018hypothetical buyers and sellers\u2019 would pay in a \u2018hypothetical\ntransaction.\u2019 \u201d (Long Beach Memorial Medical Center v. Kaiser\nFoundation Health Plan, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 323, 343, 345\n[discussing measure of damages under quantum meruit claim,\nwhich was identical to restitution under UCL]; see also id. at\np. 346 [defining fair market value based on hypothetical\ntransactions \u201cis affirmatively helpful because it emphasizes\nanother pertinent legal principle \u2014 namely, that the parties\u2019\nprior actual transactions are not dipositive\u201d].) Option 2 therefore\nrepresents a reasonable approximation of a remedy that RPA\nplaintiffs might obtain through litigation, but it avoids the costs\nof litigation CIC would otherwise incur.\n 2. Reinsurance of CIC\u2019s policies under section 2.2\n Besides section 2.6\u2019s settlement options for the RPA\nlitigation, CIC also challenges the trial court\u2019s approval of section\n\f2.2 of the plan, which requires CIC to enter into a reinsurance\nand assumption agreement for its California policies. \u201cA\nreinsurance contract is \u2018one by which an insurer procures a third\nperson to insure him [i.e., the insurer] against loss or liability by\nreason of such original insurance.\u2019 (\u00a7 620.) If the agreement is\npurely for reinsurance, it benefits only the insurer; the original\ninsured has no interest in it (\u00a7 623) and acquires no rights under\nit. [Citation.] Such an agreement clearly cannot operate to\nrelieve the original insurer of any obligation to the insured. [\u00b6] A\ncontract by which a reinsurer assumes the policies of the original\ninsurer does result in the reinsurer being directly liable to the\noriginal insureds [citation], but it does not release the original\ninsurer, which remains jointly obligated with the reinsurer\n[citations.].\u201d (Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at pp. 95\u201396, italics\nomitted.)\n CIC\u2019s first argument is that section 2.2 improperly requires\nthe sale of over 85 percent of its business to end the\nconservatorship, which is tantamount to liquidation. CIC points\nout that liquidation is supposed to be the last resort in a\nconservatorship. (Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 329.) But\nliquidation entails distributing an insurer\u2019s assets to creditors,\nand it is a last resort because it dissolves the company and\ndeprives policyholders of insurance protection. (Ibid.) CIC, by\ncontrast, will retain any proceeds from the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement, rather than distributing them to its\ncreditors, so section 2.2 is not a liquidation. Section 2.2 also does\n\fnot deprive any policyholders of insurance protection, so it need\nnot be a last resort like liquidation.\n Although CIC briefly suggests otherwise, reinsurance is\nwithin the commissioner\u2019s express authority as conservator.\nSection 1043 states that \u201cthe commissioner, as conservator or as\nliquidator, may, subject to the approval of said court, and subject\nto such liens as may be necessary mutualize or reinsure the\nbusiness of such person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements.\u201d\nThere can be no question that the commissioner has the\nnecessary authority.\n CIC claims that the commissioner could have pursued less\nonerous alternatives, including allowing CIC to continue to\nservice its policies after leaving the state. As noted ante, CIC\u2019s\nattempted merger with CIC II would have led to it departing\nfrom California, functionally equivalent to a withdrawal from the\nstate. Before withdrawing from the state, an insurer must\n\u201cdischarge its liabilities to residents of this State,\u201d including\ncausing its policies \u201cto be reinsured and assumed by another\nadmitted insurer.\u201d (\u00a7 1071.5.) The commissioner will then cancel\nthe withdrawing insurer\u2019s certificates of authority and allow the\ninsurer to withdraw. (\u00a7 1072.) Section 1072 gives the\ncommissioner discretion to waive this requirement if he finds the\nwithdrawing insurer to be solvent. (Ibid.)\n The default assumption of sections 1071.5 and 1072 is that\na withdrawing insurer will have its remaining policies reinsured\nand assumed by an admitted insurer. The commissioner\nreasonably decided to the take the same approach with CIC given\n\fthat its merger was functionally a withdrawal from the state.\nCIC protests that Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at page 99 held that\nan insurer that withdraws can still service its policies from out of\nstate, as demonstrated by the fact that section 1072 allows the\ncommissioner to waive the reinsurance and assumption\nrequirement for a solvent insurer. This is true, but the\ncommissioner still retains the discretion over whether to waive\nthe reinsurance and assumption requirement. (\u00a7 1072 [\u201cThe\ncommissioner may, in his discretion, waive any or all of the above\nrequirements . . . \u201d].) The trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin not requiring the commissioner to waive the presumptive\nrequirement of reinsurance and assumption here, where CIC\nattempted to merge and depart from California without the\ncommissioner\u2019s consent and with the purpose of evading the\ncommissioner\u2019s review of its handling of the RPA litigation. 8\n(Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 597\n[CIC merger \u201cwas an obvious attempt to avoid the California\ninsurance regulatory regime\u201d].)\n In its second challenge to section 2.2, CIC argues the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by approving the specific provision\nthat requires that any reinsurer who is affiliated with CIC, such\nas Continental, to use a third-party claims administrator. CIC\n\n8 The trial court also found the reinsurance and assumption\n\nrequirement justified based on evidence that CIC\u2019s management\nhad repeatedly evaded the commissioner\u2019s regulatory authority,\nboth before and during the conservatorship. Much, if not all, of\nthe evidence of this evasion provides further support for the trial\ncourt\u2019s order, but it is not necessary to consider it because CIC\u2019s\nconduct giving rise to the conservatorship is sufficient on its own.\n\fargues that the department proposed the third-party\nadministrator condition for a CIC-affiliated reinsurer without\nevidence to support it and then tried and failed to justify it\nretroactively.\n The trial court found the commissioner reasonably insisted\non a third-party claims administrator if Continental or another\nCIC affiliate reinsured and assumed CIC\u2019s policies, based in part\non the fact that Continental is operated by the same management\nas CIC, including Menzies as the president and chief executive\nofficer. The trial court also found substantial evidence showed\nthat CIC had not treated policyholders fairly by (1) increasing\npayouts on claims or inflating the reserves necessary for claims,\nthereby triggering higher costs for policyholders; and (2) keeping\nclaims open to postpone having to return unused premiums to the\npolicyholders, so that CIC could maximize the investment returns\nit made on the funds.\n We find substantial evidentiary support for all three points.\nFirst, the record shows that Menzies is Continental\u2019s president\nand chief executive officer and Jeffrey Silver is its Secretary.\nMenzies and Silver hold similar roles in CIC as well as AUCRA,\nwhich is another of the entities involved in the RPA and the\nEquityComp program. Given the identical management,\nallowing Continental to reinsure and assume CIC\u2019s policies and\ncontinue servicing claims would defeat the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement\u2019s purpose of protecting policyholders from\nmanagement that has demonstrated its willingness to attempt to\nevade the commissioner\u2019s oversight. It would essentially change\n\fthe nameplate on the door but allow the business to continue to\noperate as usual. This alone is sufficient to support the third-\nparty administrator requirement.\n Second, the commissioner submitted evidence showing that\nthe EquityComp program incentivized CIC to increase payments\nor reserves for claims unnecessarily and that CIC in fact did so.\nRegarding the incentive, most retrospective rating plans increase\nthe premiums a policyholder pays linearly as losses increase, up\nto a maximum premium. But the EquityComp plan increased\npremiums steeply for the initial portion of losses to a certain\namount, then raised premiums more slowly if losses continued to\nincrease. If CIC overpaid claims and thereby increased its losses,\nor if it set an artificially high estimate of reserves necessary to\npay losses on a claim in the future, it could trigger the initial\nsteep increase in premiums that policyholders would have to pay.\nCounsel for plaintiffs in many of the RPA cases, Larry J.\nLichtenegger, submitted a declaration detailing specific instances\nin which CIC\u2019s overpayment of employee claims increased\npolicyholders\u2019 costs, including one in which a putatively injured\nformer employee was working for a competitor, and CIC verified\nthe fraud but continued paying the former employee. The\ncommissioner also cited the Shasta Linen case, which relayed a\npolicyholder\u2019s account of CIC\u2019s failure to investigate potential\nfraud on a claim that cost the policyholder over $100,000.\n(Shasta Linen, supra, at p. 38.)\n Finally, the commissioner provided evidence that CIC kept\nclaims open to retain policyholders\u2019 funds longer, to maximize\n\fCIC\u2019s profits. The EquityComp program was structured to allow\nAUCRA (the CIC-affiliated reinsurer that took risk and\npremiums from CIC and passed them back to the policyholders)\nto require policyholders to post collateral to secure their payment\nof additional premiums due to losses. Setting high collateral\namounts for future losses benefited CIC and its affiliates because\nCIC could earn investment returns on the collateral and did not\nhave to share the returns with the policyholders. CIC followed\nthese incentives in several cases documented in Lichtenegger\u2019s\ndeclaration. For example, CIC refused to accept an employee\u2019s\noffer to settle a claim for less than the amount of reserves set\naside for the claim, even though the policyholder, which would\nincur the cost for the settlement, wanted to pay it in order to\nhave CIC refund the excess reserves.\n In response to this evidence, CIC cites evidence that the\ndepartment allowed CIC to continue to handle claims during the\nconservatorship and CIC was rated highly in claims handling in\nstate audits. CIC also attacks Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility,\nasserting, among other things, that he and his clients were\nobviously self-interested and arguing that he cited very few\nspecific examples of claims handling. Finally, CIC argues,\nprimarily in a footnote, that it submitted a declaration by an\nexpert who reviewed CIC\u2019s files for the policyholders mentioned\nand refuted Lichtenegger\u2019s allegations.\n The trial court reasonably rejected or discounted CIC\u2019s\narguments. The commissioner could reasonably conclude that his\noversight and that of his representatives, including being\n\fphysically present at CIC\u2019s offices in Nebraska, were sufficient to\ndeter CIC from its prior abusive practices. CIC\u2019s high marks in\naudits of its claims handling do not undercut the commissioner\u2019s\nevidence of overpayments. As the trial court noted, the audits\nlooked for evidence of underpayments, not overpayments, so\nCIC\u2019s high scores do not refute the evidence that CIC was\noverpaying claims to collect higher premiums from its\npolicyholders. And Lichtenegger\u2019s declaration did not purport to\nprovide an exhaustive description of all of his clients\u2019 qualms\nabout CIC\u2019s claims handling, so the quantity of examples he cited\nis not disqualifying. Although Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility was\nlegitimately open to question for various reasons (including his\nposition as advocate for policyholders with RPA litigation claims\nagainst CIC), credibility decisions were for the trial court and the\ncommissioner to make. The court and commissioner could\nreasonably decide to rely on Lichtenegger, given his unique\nfamiliarity with the experiences of many different policyholders.\nAlthough CIC\u2019s expert declaration provided the trial court an\nalternative view of the evidence, the trial court was ultimately\nfaced with conflicting evidence on both sides, and CIC\u2019s evidence\nrelating to its claims handling was not so overwhelming as to\nundercut the value of the commissioner\u2019s evidence as a matter of\nlaw.\n In sum, we are unpersuaded that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by approving section 2.2.\n DISPOSITION\n The trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\n\f BROWN, P.

    "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nPATRICK EDDINGTON,\n\nPlaintiff,\n\nv.\n No. 19-cv-2081-JMC-MAU\n U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,\n\nDefendant.\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nBefore the Court is Plaintiff Patrick Eddington\u2019s Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\n\n(\u201cMotion\u201d). ECF Nos. 50; 52. Defendant, the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d),\n\nopposes the Motion. ECF No. 51. Because Eddington fails to show he is eligible for attorneys\u2019\n\nfees, the Court recommends that Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nEddington is a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, which he refers to as \u201ca leading think\n\ntank dedicated to promoting individual liberty.\u201d Decl. of Patrick G. Eddington, ECF No. 50-1 \u00b6\u00b6\n\n3\u20134. Eddington\u2019s research and publications focus on domestic surveillance and political\n\nrepression. Id. \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Eddington filed a FOIA request with the National Security Division\n\n(\u201cNSD\u201d) of the DOJ. Id. \u00b6 6. Eddington sought records from June 3, 2015, to May 15, 2019,\n\nconcerning the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective\n\nDiscipline Over Monitoring Act of 2015 (\u201cUSA FREEDOM\u201d). Id. at 4\u20135.1 According to\n Citations throughout this Report and Recommendation are to the page numbers in a filing\u2019s\nECF header.\n\fEddington, the Act placed conditions on the Government\u2019s collection of citizens\u2019\n\ntelecommunications metadata. Id. \u00b6 7. Eddington\u2019s FOIA request had two parts: \u201c1) internal or\n\nexternal reports on the efficacy of programs carried out under [USA FREEDOM], including\n\nsolicited or unsolicited feedback from agents or intelligence analysts, whether formal or informal\n\nin nature; and 2) any correspondence dealing with the termination or initiation of programs\n\nconducted under [USA FREEDOM].\u201d Id. at 4.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, the DOJ acknowledged receipt of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request. Id. at \u00b6\n\n10, 6. The DOJ informed Eddington that it processed requests \u201con a first-in, first-out basis.\u201d Id.\n\nat 6. The DOJ also noted that the processing time for Eddington\u2019s request would depend on the\n\ncomplexity of the request, whether the request involved sensitive information or many records,\n\nand whether the DOJ needed to consult with other agencies to process the request. Id.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nEddington filed suit less than a month later, on July 12, 2019. ECF No. 1. In the\n\nComplaint, he requested that the DOJ conduct a reasonable search and produce all non-exempt\n\nrequested records. Id. at 2\u20133. The DOJ answered the Complaint on August 27, 2019. ECF No.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, the Parties filed their first joint status report (\u201cJSR\u201d), in which the\n\nDOJ stated it was \u201cin the process of conducting its searches\u201d for responsive records. ECF No. 11\n\n\u00b6 2. The DOJ noted it had to seek those records from individual custodians, as there was no\n\ncentralized database. Id. The DOJ anticipated completing its search by October 31, 2019. Id. On\n\nthat date, the DOJ informed the Court that it had completed its search for part one of Eddington\u2019s\n\nFOIA request and found no responsive records. ECF No. 12 \u00b6 2. The Parties also discussed\n\nnarrowing part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request to exclude internal communications. ECF Nos.\n\f12 \u00b6 2; 13 \u00b6 2. The DOJ claimed that including those communications in its search would cause a\n\ndelay in any document production. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 2; 14 \u00b6 2. The Parties, however, did not reach\n\nan agreement on narrowing part two of the request. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 3; 14 \u00b6 3.\n\nIn January 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it estimated completing its search for\n\npart two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request by March 3, 2020. ECF No. 14 \u00b6 4. On that date, the DOJ\n\ntold Eddington that it had completed its search and was reviewing results. ECF Nos. 51\u20131; 17 \u00b6\n\n4. The DOJ stated it would provide Eddington with another response by May 3, 2020. ECF No.\n\n51\u20131. On March 17, 2020, however, the agency informed the Court that the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nwould impact its ability to timely process records and issue a response. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 13, 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it could not provide another response\n\nor production schedule because the DOJ\u2019s telework policies prevented access to a classified server\n\non which the responsive records were kept. ECF No. 19 \u00b6 4. These access restrictions continued\n\nuntil April 2022. See ECF Nos. 20 \u00b6 4; 38 \u00b6 3.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, the DOJ stated it had recently resumed processing Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest and had located approximately 600 potentially-responsive pages. ECF No. 38 \u00b6 4. The\n\nDOJ\u2019s processing involved coordination with other government agencies, including the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). ECF Nos. 38 \u00b6 5; 50-1 \u00b6 11; 51-3. On December 16, 2022, the\n\nFBI produced a redacted and previously-sealed declaration that the Government had filed in the\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ECF Nos. 50-1 at 7\u201324; 51-3.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, the DOJ issued its final response to part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest. ECF Nos. 41 \u00b6 5; 51-2. The DOJ informed Eddington that it had located seventy-two\n\npages of responsive records, all of which the DOJ withheld pursuant to various FOIA exemptions.\n\nECF No. 51-2. Eddington did not challenge any of the agency\u2019s withholdings or redactions. ECF\n\fNo. 50-1 \u00b6 14. On March 29, 2024, Eddington filed this Motion for an award of $18,980.15 in\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees and costs. ECF Nos. 50; 52.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to FOIA\u2019s fee recovery provision, a court may assess reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n\nand litigation costs against the United States in a case \u201cin which the complainant has substantially\n\nprevailed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). The objectives of this provision are twofold: 1) to\n\nencourage FOIA litigation that benefits the public interest when private interest is lacking; and 2)\n\nto compensate plaintiffs for enduring an agency\u2019s unreasonable stonewalling in complying with\n\nFOIA\u2019s requirements. See Kwoka v. Internal Revenue Serv., 989 F.3d 1058, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\n\nEven if the Court deems the plaintiff a prevailing party under the FOIA statute, a fee award is not\n\nautomatic. See Morley v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 894 F.3d 389, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam)\n\n(noting that FOIA states that the Court \u201cmay\u201d award fees to a prevailing plaintiff, not that the\n\nCourt \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d). The Court retains broad discretion in deciding whether to award fees.\n\nSee Hall & Assocs. v. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 210 F. Supp. 3d 13, 19 (D.D.C. 2016) (citations\n\nomitted), aff\u2019d per curiam, No. 16-5315, 2018 WL 1896493 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 9, 2018)\n\n(unpublished).\n\nTo recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under FOIA, a plaintiff must be both eligible for and\n\nentitled to fees. Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 811 F.3d 22, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2016). If a\n\nplaintiff is eligible and entitled, they may recover a fee award that is reasonable. Urb. Air\n\nInitiative, Inc. v. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 442 F. Supp. 3d 301, 310 (D.D.C. 2020) (citations omitted).\n\f I. Eddington Is Not Eligible to Recover Attorneys\u2019 Fees Because He Has Failed to\n Establish That He Substantially Prevailed in This Lawsuit.\n\nA. Legal Standard\n\nOne of the ways a plaintiff can show they substantially prevailed in the litigation is by\n\nestablishing that they obtained relief through \u201ca voluntary or unilateral change in position by the\n\nagency, if the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim [was] not insubstantial.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(ii). This is\n\nreferred to as the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d Grand Canyon Tr. v. Bernhardt, 947 F.3d 94, 95 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2020) (per curiam).\n\nUnder the catalyst theory, the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that, but\n\nfor the plaintiff filing suit, the agency would not have performed the desired act, such as producing\n\nrecords. Id. at 97 (citations omitted); see Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Harris, 653 F.2d 584,\n\n587 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting this is a question of causation). Courts look at the totality of the\n\ncircumstances to determine whether there is a causal nexus between a plaintiff filing suit and an\n\nagency\u2019s change in position. See Conservation Force v. Jewell, 160 F. Supp. 3d 194, 202 (D.D.C.\n\n2016) (citation omitted). If factors unrelated to the lawsuit trigger an agency\u2019s disclosure, the\n\nplaintiff has not demonstrated causation and is not a prevailing party under the catalyst theory.\n\nGrand Canyon Tr. v. Zinke, 311 F. Supp. 3d 381, 389 (D.D.C. 2018), aff\u2019d sub nom. Grand Canyon\n\nTr., 947 F.3d 94.\n\nAlthough timing may be relevant in this analysis, a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a complaint and an\n\nagency\u2019s subsequent disclosure is not enough to show causation. See Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d\n\nat 97; see also Pub. L. Educ. Inst. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 744 F.2d 181, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating\n\nsomething \u201cmore than post hoc, ergo propter hoc must be shown\u201d). There must be \u201chard evidence\u201d\n\nbeyond timing that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit caused the agency to release documents or provide other\n\nrequested relief. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, the Court may\n\fconsider whether the agency had a reasonable amount of time to respond to a FOIA request before\n\nthe plaintiff filed suit. See First Look Inst. Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, No. 20-cv-3499,\n\n2024 WL 3744818, at *4 (D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2024) (collecting cases), report and recommendation\n\nadopted sub nom. First Look Media Works, Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, 2024 WL\n\n4262773 (D.D.C. Sept. 23, 2024), aff\u2019d sub nom. per curiam, First Look Inst., Inc. v. U.S. Agency\n\nfor Glob. Media, No. 24-5257, 2025 WL 1840647 (D.C. Cir. July 2, 2025) (unpublished). The\n\nCourt also considers whether unavoidable external factors caused an agency\u2019s delay, including\n\ninadvertent administrative constraints. See Env\u2019t Integrity Project v. United States Env\u2019t Prot.\n\nAgency, 316 F. Supp. 3d 320, 328 (D.D.C. 2018).\n\nB. Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\nEddington makes a half-hearted argument that he is eligible for fees under the catalyst\n\ntheory.2 ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. His only meaningful argument is that the lawsuit caused\n\na \u201csudden acceleration\u201d of the DOJ\u2019s production. ECF No. 50 at 4. Under that theory, Eddington\n\npoints to two pieces of alleged \u201chard evidence.\u201d Id. at 5-6. He asserts that the DOJ \u201cimmediately\n\nbegan processing\u201d his request once he filed suit because the DOJ stated in the Parties\u2019 first JSR\n\nthat the agency was in the process of conducting searches. ECF Nos. 1; 50 at 5; see also ECF No.\n\n11 \u00b6 2. Relying on the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report,3 Eddington contrasts the nearly four-month\n\nperiod between his May 15, 2019 FOIA request and the Parties\u2019 first JSR, with the DOJ\u2019s average\n Indeed, he devoted only two paragraphs in his opening Motion to this argument.\n Each fiscal year, agencies must publicly report certain statistical information concerning\ntheir FOIA processes to the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Government\nInformation Services. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e). Courts in this District have relied on these reports\nin FOIA cases. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. C.I.A., 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 259 n.14 (D.D.C. 2012),\naff\u2019d, 969 F.3d 406 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\n\fprocessing time in the NSD of over one year for \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests.4 ECF No. 50 at 5\u20136.\n\nEddington claims that the disparity between the average processing time and the time it took for\n\nthe DOJ to start processing his FOIA request shows that it is \u201clikely\u201d that the DOJ would not have\n\nprocessed his request as soon as it did absent this lawsuit. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135.\n\nEddington also asserts that the DOJ failed to provide evidence of its pre-suit processing steps.\n\nECF No. 52 at 4\u20135.\n\nThe DOJ argues that Eddington fails to provide any \u201cevidence that this suit caused [the\n\nDOJ] to change what it already was doing with respect to the FOIA request.\u201d ECF No. 51 at 8.\n\nThe DOJ first argues that it is not the case that the agency failed to communicate with Eddington\n\nprior to his lawsuit because the agency let him know it was processing the request. Id. at 7. The\n\nDOJ sent a letter on June 17, 2019, informing Eddington that it would process his request as\n\nquickly as possible consistent with the agency\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and the administrative\n\ndemands of the request. Id. at 7, 10\u201311; see also ECF No. 50-1 at 6. Second, the DOJ argues that\n\nthe DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report does not provide any conclusive evidence of a \u201csudden acceleration\u201d\n\nin this case. ECF No. 51 at 11\u201312. Among other things, the agency points out that the Report\n\nsimply provides averages from one fiscal year, which necessarily means that there were requests\n\nthat were processed in less time than the average. Id. at 11. The agency also points out that the\n\nReport fails to account for other \u201cunforeseen contingent events that may operate to quicken or slow\n\ndown the processing of a FOIA request.\u201d Id. The DOJ also notes that Eddington\u2019s argument\n\nhinges entirely on FOIA statistics from 2019 despite the DOJ not completing processing in this\n\ncase until January 2023. Id. at 12.\n See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., United States Department of Justice Annual Freedom of\nInformation Act Report: Fiscal Year 2019 34 (2019) (\u201c2019 FOIA Report\u201d),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1253751/dl?inline=.\n\f C. Discussion\n\nEddington has failed to establish that it is more probable than not that his lawsuit caused\n\nthe DOJ to change its pre-suit position on his FOIA request. Eddington asks the Court to find that\n\nhe has substantially prevailed in this lawsuit based solely on the proposition that the NSD\u2019s average\n\ntime in 2019 for fully processing a complex FOIA request was greater than the time it took for the\n\nagency to start processing Eddington\u2019s request. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that this alleged disparity establishes the DOJ \u201csuddenly accelerated\u201d processing\n\nbecause Eddington filed suit. ECF No. 50 at 4.\n\nCourts in this District have concluded that an agency\u2019s \u201csudden acceleration\u201d in processing\n\na FOIA request after a plaintiff files suit may show that the lawsuit caused the agency to change\n\nits position. Terris, Pravlik & Millian, LLP v. Cents. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., 794 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 29, 38 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Crooker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 663 F.2d 140 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1980)). This necessarily means that a plaintiff must first show that the agency initially took\n\nan adverse position on the FOIA request or engaged in an unexplained delay before the plaintiff\n\nfiled suit. See First Look Media Works, Inc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *4. A plaintiff must then\n\nprove that \u201cthe agency did in fact accelerate its response to the FOIA request because of the\n\nlawsuit.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Eddington does not make either showing.\n\nEddington fails to show that the DOJ initially took an adverse position on his FOIA request\n\nor engaged in a significant and unexplained pre-suit delay. See Am. Wild Horse Campaign v. U.S.\n\nBureau of Land Mgmt., No. 22-cv-3061, 2024 WL 3967256, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 26, 2024) (noting\n\nthat an agency\u2019s significant delay can support an inference that the agency forgot about or ignored\n\nthe request). Although the DOJ does not provide a declaration explaining its pre-suit processing,\n\nEddington\u2019s own evidence shows that the agency was aware of his FOIA request. ECF No. 50-1\n\fat 6. The agency sent Eddington a response within thirty-three days of his FOIA request. Id. \u00b6 10.\n\nIn that pre-suit letter, the agency informed Eddington that it would process his request as quickly\n\nas possible in line with the DOJ\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and other administrative demands. Id.\n\nat 6; see Grand Canyon Tr., 311 F. Supp. 3d at 390 (holding that plaintiff was not eligible for fees\n\ndespite the agency\u2019s failure to produce a declaration). Accordingly, this is not a case in which the\n\nagency ignored the FOIA request, took an adverse pre-suit position, or delayed significantly in\n\ngetting back to Eddington.\n\nMoreover, Eddington filed suit only fifty-eight days after making his FOIA request and\n\nonly twenty-five days after the agency first responded to him. ECF No. 50-1 at \u00b6 10. This further\n\nundermines the argument that there was some supposed pre-suit delay. First Look Media Works,\n\nInc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *5; Am. Wild Horse Campaign, 2024 WL 3967256, at *1, *3 (finding\n\nthe plaintiff was not eligible for fees despite the agency failing to communicate pre-suit with the\n\nplaintiff for eight months after confirming receipt). Eddington cannot manufacture a \u201csudden\n\nacceleration\u201d simply by rushing to file suit and then claiming that the lawsuit caused the DOJ to\n\nsubsequently process and release documents. The timing of Eddington\u2019s lawsuit means that the\n\nagency would in any circumstance be producing documents after the suit was filed. Gov\u2019t\n\nAccountability & Oversight v. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, No. 23-cv-3268, 2024 WL 4828107, at *5\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 19, 2024). Eddington has failed to show that the DOJ was doing anything but\n\nproceeding business as usual on his FOIA request before he filed suit. Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe\n\nof Indians v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 750 F.2d 117, 120 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\u201cAbsent any evidence on\n\nthe matter, the natural inference is that the [defendant] was simply responding to the [plaintiff\u2019s]\n\nrequest.\u201d).\n\f Eddington also fails to show that the DOJ suddenly accelerated processing his FOIA\n\nrequest because of his lawsuit. In determining whether an agency would have taken longer to\n\nproduce responsive records absent a lawsuit, the Court may compare the agency\u2019s processing time\n\nfor a specific FOIA request against the agency\u2019s average processing time for similar requests. See,\n\ne.g., Gov\u2019t Accountability & Oversight, 2024 WL 4828107, at *4. Eddington errs, however, in\n\nattempting to make an apples-to-apples comparison between his case and the average processing\n\ntime for 2019 \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests. First, Eddington merely assumes without any support\n\nthat his case qualifies as \u201ccomplex\u201d as the agency defined that term for inclusion of cases in the\n\n2019 report.5 See 2019 FOIA Report at 34 (recording that the NSD had an average processing\n\ntime of approximately 110 days for simple FOIA request versus an average of approximately 418\n\ndays for complex FOIA requests). Second, Eddington does not account for the fact that, even if\n\nhis case did qualify as \u201ccomplex,\u201d the report still presents only an average number, necessarily\n\nmeaning that there were complex cases which were processed faster than the average.\n\nThird, the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report captures the average time the DOJ took to complete\n\nprocessing for a FOIA request, not the time it took to initiate processing. See id. at 5 (defining a\n\nprocessed FOIA request as \u201ca request . . . for which an agency has taken final action in all\n\nrespects\u201d). As Eddington acknowledges, the DOJ did not complete processing for his FOIA\n\nrequest until January 11, 2023, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. ECF Nos. 41; 50 at 5 n.2; 51-\n\n2. The DOJ, therefore, took approximately 1,337 days to process Eddington\u2019s FOIA request.\n\nEddington does not offer any explanation to account for the fact that this 1,377-day processing\n\ntime was actually longer than the 418-day average upon which he relies. Finally, Eddington does\n In the 2019 FOIA Report, the DOJ defines a complex request as \u201ca FOIA request that an\nagency using multi-track processing places in a slower track based on the high volume and/or\ncomplexity of the records requested.\u201d See 2019 FOIA Report at 5.\n\fnot provide any evidence that, absent the Covid-19 pandemic, the DOJ would have completed\n\nprocessing his request much faster than this 418-day average. See Harrington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\n\nHealth & Hum. Servs., No. 20-cv-2671, 2022 WL 17555428, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 9, 2022)\n\n(concluding the plaintiff was ineligible for fees despite the agency completing processing \u201ca few\n\nmonths faster\u201d than the agency\u2019s estimated completion date).\n\nIn sum, Eddington has not shown that the DOJ initially engaged in an unexplained delay\n\nbefore he filed suit or that his lawsuit caused the DOJ to suddenly accelerate processing for his\n\nFOIA request. Eddington does not provide hard evidence that he substantially prevailed in this\n\nlitigation beyond the fact that the DOJ processed his FOIA request and produced documents after\n\nhe filed suit. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, Eddington is not eligible\n\nfor attorneys\u2019 fees. Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d at 97 (citations omitted). Because Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that he is eligible for fees, the Court need not consider whether he is entitled to fees\n\nor if his requested award is reasonable.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nDate: July 23, 2025\n\n___________________________________\n MOXILA A.

Part One of request\n\nsought records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the total number of labor hours worked during that period,\n\nand Part Two demanded records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the hours devoted \u201cto investigations of\n\nany and all matters related to left wing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist\n\nagendas-anarchists like Antifa and other agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Def.\u2019s\n\nMot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 13 [hereinafter Def.\u2019s Mot.], Decl. of Michael G. Seidel, ECF No.\n\n13-1 [hereinafter Seidel Decl.], \u00b6 5, Ex. A. The FBI produced a one-page record in response to the\n\nfirst part of the request, but as to the second advised Plaintiff:\n\nThe FOIA does not require federal agencies to answer inquiries,\n create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions concerning\n queried data. Rather the FOIA requires agencies to provide access\n to reasonably described, nonexempt records. The questions posed\n\f in the referenced letter are not FOIA requests because they do not\n comply with the FOIA and its regulations. Therefore, your request\n is being administratively closed.\n\nId., Ex. F.\n\nDefendant moves for summary judgment. See Def.\u2019s Mot. Plaintiffs do not contest the\n\nagency\u2019s response to Part One of the request. Mem. in Support of Pls.\u2019 Mot. in Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s\n\nMot., ECF No. 19 [hereinafter Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n], at 2 n.1. Their dispute concerns Part Two. At issue is\n\nwhether Plaintiffs properly exhausted administrative remedies as to that portion of the demand,\n\nand whether Defendant conducted an adequate search for records. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 8\u201310; Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n\n\nat 9\u201311.\n\nThe court finds that Defendant performed an adequate search with respect to Part Two of\n\nthe request. It therefore does not reach the exhaustion issue. See Hidalgo v. FBI, 344 F.3d 1256,\n\n1258 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (stating that \u201cthe exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional because the\n\nFOIA does not unequivocally make it so\u201d). Accordingly, the court will enter judgment in favor of\n\nDefendant.\n\nII.\n\nTo demonstrate it conducted an adequate search, an \u201cagency must show that it made a good\n\nfaith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably\n\nexpected to produce the information requested.\u201d Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 920 F.2d 57,\n\n68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The agency must provide a \u201creasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the\n\nsearch terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain\n\nresponsive materials (if such records exist) were searched.\u201d Id. An agency affidavit is accorded a\n\npresumption of good faith if it is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory, and . . . submitted in\n\ngood faith.\u201d Eddington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 35 F.4th 833, 837 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting\n\fSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). That presumption cannot be\n\novercome with \u201cpurely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of [the request].\u201d\n\nId. (quoting SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200) (alteration in original). The plaintiff must provide\n\n\u201c\u2018countervailing evidence\u2019 as to the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\u201d Iturralde v. Comptroller of\n\nthe Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted). \u201cIf a review of the\n\nrecord raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of well defined requests and positive\n\nindications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is inappropriate.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nIn this case, Defendant\u2019s declaration from Michael Seidel is entitled to a presumption of\n\ngood faith. It is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory\u201d and explains why the FBI produced no\n\nrecords in response to Part Two of the request. See Eddington, 35 F.4th at 837; Seidel Decl.,\n\nSeidel is the Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the FBI.\n\nSeidel Decl. \u00b6 1. He states that, to identify responsive information, the agency turned to the\n\nPerformance Management Unit (PMU), Resources Planning Office, in the Office of the Associate\n\nDeputy Director. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 23. Seidel explains:\n\nPMU is responsible for organizing and making management data\n accessible to the FBI to impact decisions on program management,\n resource allocation and organizational planning. PMU structures\n and arranges information related to various aspects of the FBI\n operations and resources, and ensures that crucial data is readily\n available and easily retrievable when needed.\n\nId. PMU advised that its ability to report validated hours for specific cases assigned to the\n\nWashington Field Office was \u201climited.\u201d Id. \u00b6 26. FBI agents record hours worked on cases and\n\nassociate certain classification codes, but \u201cthere is no tracking mechanism for distinguishing cases\n\nrelated to specific events.\u201d Id. There is no classification code associated with matters such as \u201cleft\n\nwing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist agendas-anarchists like Antifa and\n\nother agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Id. To fulfill Part Two of the request, the\n\fFBI \u201cwould be required to answer inquiries, create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions\n\nconcerning queried data which are not required under FOIA.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27. The FBI \u201cdoes not\n\nmaintain the specific data sought by Plaintiffs\u201d in Part Two of their request. Id. \u00b6 32.\n\nPlaintiffs submit two critiques of the search. First, grasping on to the word \u201climited,\u201d which\n\nPMU used to describe its capacity to retrieve labor hours data about specific events, Plaintiffs\n\nassert that the declaration lacks sufficient specificity to establish that responsive data does not\n\nexist. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10. But that contention overlooks Seidel\u2019s explanation that \u201cto fulfill\n\nPlaintiffs[\u2019] request\u201d the agency would have to sift through the available data, analyze it, drawn\n\ninferences from it, and create a new record. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 27. The declaration leaves no room for\n\ndoubt that data responsive to Part Two does not independently exist.\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs fault the agency for not inquiring into whether the data sought \u201cmay have\n\nalready been compiled\u201d in some other form. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. As Plaintiffs put it: \u201c[T]he FBI\n\nappears to only have searched for source data to produce \u2018records sufficient to show\u2019; it appears\n\nthey did not search for compilations of that data that answer the same question.\u201d Id. at 11.\n\nBut Plaintiffs offer no \u201ccountervailing evidence\u201d to believe that such a compilation exists. They\n\ndo not assert that the FBI \u201cfailed to search particular offices or files where the document might\n\nwell have been found.\u201d Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315. They do not contend that the agency \u201cfailed\n\nor refused to interview government officials for whom there was strong evidence that they might\n\nhave been helpful in finding the missing documents.\u201d Id. And Plaintiffs point to no \u201cevidence\n\nthat would indicate that at the time the Department searched its files there was reason to believe\u201d\n\nthat a responsive compilation of data was contained in the files. Id.; see Eddington, 35 F.4th at\n\n838 (describing Iturralde as \u201clisting ways government affidavit or declaration could be\n\ninadequate\u201d).\n\f In the end, Plaintiffs merely speculate that a report or some other record exists that contains\n\nthe highly specific information that they seek: verified labor hours spent by (1) a particular FBI\n\nfield office (2) during a defined three-month period (3) on investigations into left-wing domestic\n\nterrorist groups like Antifa and \u201cother agitators\u201d that (4) arose out of \u201cthe summer 2020 riots.\u201d\n\nSee Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. Plaintiffs\u2019 supposition that such a data compilation might exist is not\n\nenough to raise substantial doubt about the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court grants Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nECF No. 13. A final, appealable order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nDated: July 23, 2025 Amit P. Mehta\n United States District Judge\n\n5"

Toussaint (\u201cMs. Toussaint\u201d), seeks supervisory review\n\nof the trial court\u2019s June 17, 2025 judgment, which denied her \u201cMotion for Leave to\n\nIntervene\u201d (\u201cMotion to Intervene\u201d). For the following reasons, we grant Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s writ application for the limited purpose of ordering the trial court to\n\nconsider Ms. Toussaint\u2019s \u201cNotice of Intent to File Supervisory Writ (\u201cNotice of\n\nIntent\u201d) as a timely motion for appeal.\n\nRELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL\n HISTORY\n\nOn October 3, 2022, Nichele1 Spears died during a colonoscopy screening.\n\nOn June 1, 2023, her husband, Sean Toussaint, filed a request for the appointment\n\nof a medical review panel. The medical review panel rendered an opinion on July\n\n18, 2024, therein finding that a nurse and doctor breached the applicable standard\n\nof care during Nichele Spears\u2019 procedure. Shortly thereafter, on September 3,\n\n2024, Sean Toussaint also died. On October 15, 2024, the Orleans Parish Civil\n\nDistrict Court appointed Ms. Toussaint, the sister of Sean Toussaint, as the\n\nadministratrix of his succession. Only one week later, on October 22, 2024, Rhyan\n\n1 The name \u201cNicole\u201d also appears in Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application; but this Opinion\n\nwill use the name \u201cNichele\u201d because that is the name listed in the medical review panel opinion\nand the Petition for Damages, both of which are discussed later.\n\fSpears, who is the son of Nichele Spears, filed a Petition for Damages in Orleans\n\nParish Civil District Court against the nurse and doctor regarding his mother\u2019s\n\ndeath.\n\nSubsequently, on April 15, 2025, Ms. Toussaint filed her Motion to\n\nIntervene, whereby she contended she had an interest in intervening in Rhyan\n\nSpears\u2019 lawsuit pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091 because she had been appointed\n\nadministratix of Sean Toussaint\u2019s succession; was a surviving heir of Sean\n\nToussaint; and sought the same or similar relief as Rhyan Spears.2 As Ms.\n\nToussaint explained in her Motion to Intervene, prior to his death, Sean Toussaint\n\nhad initiated a wrongful death and survival action against the defendants named in\n\nRhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit. Ms. Toussaint asserted that as the administratrix of Sean\n\nToussaint\u2019s estate, she therefore had \u201cthe right and responsibility to sue on behalf\n\nof [the] estate to recover assets owed to it, defend against claims, and ensure the\n\nestate interests [were] protected in the succession process\u201d pursuant to La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 3196.3 Rhyan Spears, the defendant nurse, and the State of Louisiana on behalf\n\nof the defendant doctor each filed an opposition to Ms. Toussaint\u2019s Motion to\n\nIntervene and asked the trial court to dismiss it.\n\nOn June 12, 2025, the trial court conducted a hearing on Ms. Toussaint\u2019s\n\nMotion to Intervene. In a judgment dated June 17, 2025, the trial court denied Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s Motion to Intervene and dismissed it with prejudice. On July 7, 2025,\n\nMs. Toussaint filed her Notice of Intent. Therein, she specified that she was\n\n2 Regarding the ability to intervene, La. C.C.P. art. 1091 states that \u201c[a] third person\n\nhaving an interest therein may intervene in a pending action to enforce a right related to or\nconnected with the object of the pending action against one or more of the parties thereto.\u201d\nAccording to La. C.C.P. art. 1031, an intervention is an incidental demand.\n 3 Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 3196 provides that \u201cIn the performance of\n\nhis [or her] duties, a succession representative may exercise all procedural rights available to a\nlitigant.\u201d\n\fseeking review of the June 17, 2025 judgment and requested that the trial court\n\nstay the proceedings in Rhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit pending this Court\u2019s decision. On\n\nJuly 9, 2025, the trial court signed the order permitting Ms. Toussaint to seek\n\nsupervisory review but denied Ms. Toussaint\u2019s request for a stay of the\n\nproceedings. This Court received Ms. Toussaint\u2019s timely writ application on July\n\n16, 2025.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\nIn her writ application, Ms. Toussaint asserts two assignments of error:\n\n1. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that filing of a\n request for a Medical Review Panel under La. R.S. 40:1231.8\n does not constitute the legal initiation of a medical malpractice\n claim.\n\n2. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that an appointed\n administrator of a deceased claimant\u2019s estate did not have legal\n authority to continue a pending medical malpractice action\n initially filed by the decedent.\n\nIn our review of Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application, we realized a procedural issue\n\nthat must be addressed before this Court can consider the merits of these above\n\narguments.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIssue One: Whether a Writ Application was the Proper Procedural Vehicle for\nSeeking Review of the Trial Court\u2019s Judgment\n\nBy filing a writ application regarding the trial court\u2019s June 17, 2025\n\njudgment dismissing her Motion to Intervene, Ms. Toussaint sought to invoke this\n\nCourt\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction rather than our appellate jurisdiction. This Court\n\n\u201chas appellate jurisdiction of . . . all civil matters\u201d and \u201chas supervisory jurisdiction\n\nover cases which arise within its circuit.\u201d La. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 10. \u201cThis [C]ourt\u2019s\n\fappellate jurisdiction extends to final judgments identified as such by appropriate\n\nlanguage and to interlocutory judgments when expressly provided by law.\u201d First\n\nNBC Bank v. River Park Dev., L.L.C., 2021-1209, p. 3 (La. App. 1 Cir. 4/8/22),\n\n341 So.3d 827, 829 (first citing La. C.C.P. arts. 1918 and 2083; and then citing\n\nBarfield v. Tammany Holding Co., 2016-1420 (La. App. 1 Cir. 6/2/17), 2017 WL\n\n2399020, *1). We begin our discussion with the question of whether a writ\n\napplication\u2014rather than an appeal\u2014was the proper procedural vehicle for Ms.\n\nToussaint to seek review of the judgment. To resolve this issue, we must determine\n\nif the trial court\u2019s judgment was appealable. If so, an appeal was the proper method\n\nfor seeking review instead of a writ application.\n\nWe find the relevant codal articles and jurisprudence interpreting them\n\nsupport a finding that a judgment dismissing a request to intervene is an appealable\n\njudgment. Defining the types of judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1841 states that a final\n\njudgment is one \u201cthat determines the merits in whole or in part.\u201d According to La.\n\nC.C.P. art. 2083, \u201c[a] final judgment is appealable in all causes in which appeals\n\nare given by law, whether rendered after hearing, by default, or by reformation\n\nunder [La. C.C.P. art.] 1814.\u201d Regarding final judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1915\n\nspecifies that a final judgment can be a partial one. That is,\n\nA. A final judgment may be rendered and signed by the court,\n even though it may not grant the successful party or parties all of the\n relief prayed for, or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case,\n when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to less than all of the parties,\n defendants, third party plaintiffs, third party defendants, or\n intervenors.\n\nLa. C.C.P. art. 1915 (A)(1). In interpreting La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) in Simmons\n\nv. Chambliss, the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal (\u201cSecond Circuit\u201d)\n\freviewed the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining exceptions of no right of action and\n\nno cause of action and dismissing the claims in intervention asserted by Anthony J.\n\nBruscato (\u201cMr. Bruscato\u201d). 37,461, p. 2 (La. App. 2 Cir. 8/20/03), 852 So.2d 1237,\n\n1238. Prior to considering the merits of the appeal, the Second Circuit ruled the\n\nappeal could proceed because the judgment was a final judgment as to Mr.\n\nBruscato under La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) since he had been dismissed from the\n\naction and was no longer a party thereto. Id. at p. 2, 852 So.2d at 1239.\n\nAdditionally, in Servi-Clean Industries, Inc. v. Tonti Management Corp., the\n\nLouisiana Supreme Court explained that a judgment dismissing an intervention is a\n\n\u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the contemplation of La. C.C.P. art. 1841 as it is a\n\ndetermination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding. 336 So.2d 799,\n\n805 (La. 1976).\n\nMoreover, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal has specifically held\n\nthat when a trial court denies a petition to intervene, this constitutes an appealable\n\njudgment. First NBC Bank, 2021-1209, p. 3, 341 So.3d at 829 (citations omitted).\n\nFurther, this Court has reviewed a trial court\u2019s judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene under its appellate jurisdiction. See generally Roy Anderson Corp. v. 225\n\nBaronne Complex, L.L.C., 2022-0784 (La. App. 4 Cir. 4/11/23), 360 So.3d 144;\n\nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 455 So.2d 1260 (La. App.\n\n4th Cir. 1984). In light of the foregoing, we find a judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene is an appealable judgment. Thus, an appeal was the proper method for\n\nMs. Toussaint to seek review of the trial court\u2019s judgment denying her Motion to\n\nIntervene, not an application for supervisory writ.\n\fIssue Two: How to Proceed with a Writ Application Seeking Review of an\nAppealable Judgment\n\nNext, we must consider how to proceed in light of our above holding that the\n\ntrial court\u2019s judgment was an appealable judgment for which Ms. Toussaint should\n\nhave filed an appeal rather than a writ application. In In re Howard, the Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court considered a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a writ application with the\n\nLouisiana Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal rather than an appeal regarding the\n\nunderlying appealable judgment. 541 So.2d 195 (La. 1989). The Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court explained the plaintiff made a mistake by seeking review of the\n\njudgment by supervisory writs rather than appeal. Id., 541 So.2d at 197. Noting,\n\nhowever, that the plaintiff filed her motion and order with the trial court within the\n\ndelay for taking a devolutive appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the\n\nmatter to the trial court with instructions to treat the plaintiff\u2019s notice of intent as a\n\nmotion for appeal and to grant the plaintiff an appeal from the judgment. Id.\n\nLike the plaintiff in In re Howard, Ms. Toussaint made a mistake when she\n\nsought review of the June 17, 2025 judgment by supervisory writs rather than by\n\nappeal because the judgment was appealable. Nevertheless, Ms. Toussaint filed her\n\nNotice of Intent and associated order well within the delays for taking an appeal.\n\nLa. C.C.P. arts. 2087, 2121, 2123. Accordingly, and because \u201c[e]very pleading\n\nshall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\u201d we find the same approach\n\nutilized by the Louisiana Supreme Court in In re Howard is proper here. La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 865. Though Ms. Toussaint erroneously titled her pleading \u201cNotice of Intent to\n\nFile Supervisory Writ,\u201d the trial court should have disregarded the erroneous title,\n\ntreated the pleading as a timely motion for appeal, and granted the appropriate\n\norder. In the interest of justice, and because Ms. Toussaint was entitled to an\n\fappeal of the June 17, 2025 final judgment upon the timely filing of a pleading\n\nseeking review of that judgment, we remand the matter to the trial court to treat\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s July 7, 2025 pleading seeking review of the June 17, 2025\n\njudgment as a timely motion for appeal. In light of this, we pretermit discussion of\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s assignments of error.\n\nDECREE\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we grant Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application for the\n\nlimited purpose of remanding this matter to the trial court with instructions to grant\n\nMs. Toussaint an appeal from the June 17, 2025 judgment.\n\nWRIT GRANTED; REMANDED\n\n7"

FISCHER, J., concurred in\njudgment only.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nPer Curiam.\n {\u00b6 1} This is an election case concerning respondent Franklin County Board\nof Elections\u2019 certification of respondent Holly Stein\u2019s name for placement on the\nNovember 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a candidate for the Ward 4 seat on the\nWhitehall City Council. Relators, Lori Elmore and the City of Whitehall, contend\nthat the board erred in certifying Stein\u2019s name because, they say, she does not meet\nthe two-year residency requirement found in Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\nAs relief, relators request a writ of prohibition to prevent the board from placing\nStein\u2019s name on the ballot. We grant the writ.\n I. BACKGROUND\n {\u00b6 2} Whitehall is a municipal corporation located within Franklin County\nand is governed by a charter. Section 3(a) of the charter provides that \u201cCouncil\nmembers for wards shall have resided in their respective wards and Council\nmembers at large shall have resided in the City for at least two years next preceding\ntheir election.\u201d Whitehall Charter, \u00a7 3(a).\n {\u00b6 3} In January 2025, Stein filed with the board a declaration of candidacy\nand a petition seeking nomination to represent Ward 4 on the Whitehall City\nCouncil. The board later certified Stein\u2019s name for placement on the November 4,\n2025 general-election ballot. Elmore currently serves as an at-large member of the\nWhitehall City Council and is a qualified Whitehall elector.\n {\u00b6 4} In February 2025, Elmore filed a protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy,\nand the board held a hearing on Elmore\u2019s protest in March. At the hearing, Elmore\ncontended that the board should disqualify Stein from the ballot because she did\nnot meet Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year residency requirement. Elmore interpreted\nSection 3(a) as requiring ward candidates to have lived in their respective wards for\nthe two years prior to the election at issue, meaning that for purposes of the\nNovember 4, 2025 general election, Stein must have lived in Ward 4 since\nNovember 4, 2023. In support of her claim that Stein did not meet this requirement,\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nElmore pointed to, among other things, Stein\u2019s voting records. Elmore deduced\nfrom these records that Stein resided in Licking County\u2014and thus outside Ward 4\nand Whitehall\u2014throughout 2023.\n {\u00b6 5} Stein appeared at the protest hearing, admitted that she lived in\nLicking County throughout 2023, and argued that she should nonetheless remain a\nWard 4 candidate for the Whitehall City Council. Stein maintained that under this\ncourt\u2019s decision in State ex rel. Rocco v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2017-\nOhio-4466, the Whitehall Charter required only that she have resided in Ward 4 for\nany two-year period preceding the election. Because she lived in Ward 4 from 2019\nuntil 2022, she asserted, her candidacy complied with Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year\nresidency requirement. Alternatively, based on principles of grammar, she argued\nthat the requirement applied only to at-large candidates and that ward candidates\nneed only show that they resided in their ward at any preceding time. Stein argued\nthat because she resided in her ward before the November 4, 2025 general election,\nher candidacy complied with Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n {\u00b6 6} At the conclusion of the hearing, the board denied Elmore\u2019s protest.\n {\u00b6 7} Relators then filed this original action seeking a writ of prohibition to\nprevent the board from placing Stein\u2019s name on the ballot or, alternatively, a writ\nof mandamus ordering the board to grant Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s\ncandidacy. We denied relators\u2019 motion to expedite the case. 2025-Ohio-1090.\nAfter respondents each filed a motion to dismiss the action, we granted the motions\nas to relators\u2019 mandamus claim, denied the motions as to the prohibition claim, sua\nsponte ordered respondents to answer the complaint as to the prohibition claim, and\nsua sponte granted an alternative writ of prohibition, scheduling the submission of\nevidence and briefs. 2025-Ohio-1757.\n {\u00b6 8} The case is ripe for our decision on relators\u2019 prohibition claim.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n {\u00b6 9} To be entitled to a writ of prohibition, relators must show that (1) the\nboard has exercised quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power was\nunauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ would result in injury for which no\nadequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of the law. State ex rel. Elder v.\nCamplese, 2015-Ohio-3628, \u00b6 13. This court has observed that after a board of\nelections exercises its quasi-judicial power by denying a protest, relief in\nprohibition is available to prevent the placement of a name or issue on a ballot\nprovided that the election has not yet been held. See, e.g., Tatman v. Fairfield Cty.\nBd. of Elections, 2004-Ohio-3701, \u00b6 14.\n {\u00b6 10} There is no dispute that the board exercised quasi-judicial power by\ndenying Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy. Nor is there a dispute that\nrelators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law due to the\nproximity of the November 4 election. Still more, the parties do not dispute the\nrelevant facts. What remains to be decided, then, is a purely legal question\nconcerning the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n A. Rocco\u2019s dueling opinions and the meaning of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\n {\u00b6 11} Relators argue that under Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter, a\nward candidate for city council must have lived in her respective ward for at least\nthe two years immediately before the election at issue. Because Stein indisputably\ndid not live in Ward 4 during any part of 2023, they maintain, she should not have\nbeen certified for placement on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a\nWard 4 candidate.\n {\u00b6 12} Relators insist that their understanding of Section 3(a) is borne out\nby its plain meaning, thereby obviating the need for interpretation. They correctly\nobserve that when this court construes a city charter, general rules of statutory\ninterpretation apply. See State ex rel. Miller v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections,\n2021-Ohio-831, \u00b6 33. Thus, because the Whitehall Charter conveys an\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nunambiguous meaning, the argument runs, the charter must be applied rather than\ninterpreted. See Pelletier v. Campbell, 2018-Ohio-2121, \u00b6 14. But although\nrelators start their argument with an appeal to plain meaning, they immediately\npivot to parsing Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d against the\nbackdrop of how that phrase was understood by members of this court in Rocco,\n2017-Ohio-4466. In relators\u2019 view, Justice DeWine\u2019s dissenting opinion in that\ncase advanced the correct understanding of the phrase\u2014i.e., that \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as being synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\n {\u00b6 13} For their part, respondents urge us to follow the lead opinion in\nRocco, under which the phrases \u201cnext preceding\u201d and \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as having different meanings. Under respondents\u2019 view of\nSection 3(a), Stein need only have lived in Ward 4 for any two-year period\npreceding the upcoming election, not the period immediately preceding the\nelection. Respondents emphasize that under Section 23(a) of the Whitehall Charter,\nmayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City for three years\nimmediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they seek election.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Respondents maintain that had the charter\u2019s drafters intended\nfor Section 3(a) to mean what relators say it means, then the drafters would have\nused the same language for ward candidates that they used for mayoral candidates.\n {\u00b6 14} Because Rocco looms large in this case, we begin our analysis by\ndiscussing that case. At issue there was whether Andrea Rocco should appear on\nthe ballot as a candidate for the City of Westlake\u2019s law director. The Westlake\nCharter provided that\n\n\u201c[t]he Director of Law shall be a qualified elector at the time of his\n election, shall have been a resident of the City for at least eighteen\n (18) months immediately preceding his election, an attorney at law\n duly admitted to the practice of law before the courts of the State of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nOhio, and been engaged in the active practice of law in Ohio for a\n period of six (6) years next preceding his election.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Rocco at \u00b6 8 (lead opinion), quoting Westlake Charter,\nart. IV, \u00a7 4.\n {\u00b6 15} Multiple protests were brought against Rocco\u2019s candidacy, arguing\nthat because she had not practiced law for the six years immediately preceding the\nupcoming election, her candidacy was defective. The Cuyahoga County Board of\nElections sustained the protests, and Rocco then brought an original action in this\ncourt, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the board to place her name on the\nballot.\n {\u00b6 16} Four separate opinions resulted. Although a majority of the court\nvoted to grant the writ, the majority could not agree on a rationale. The lead\nopinion, authored by former Justice O\u2019Donnell and joined by former Justice French,\ndetermined that the Westlake Charter required only that candidates for law director\nhave been engaged in the active practice of law for any period of six years preceding\nthe election at issue. Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 2. Former Justice O\u2019Neill concurred\nin judgment only and authored an opinion addressing a separate issue that has no\nbearing on this case. See id. at \u00b6 23-24 (O\u2019Neill, J., concurring in judgment only).\nJustice Fischer concurred in judgment only without an opinion. Former Chief\nJustice O\u2019Connor dissented, opining that the charter required law-director\ncandidates to have been engaged in the active practice of law during the six-year\nperiod immediately preceding the election. Id. at \u00b6 35 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting).\nAnd Justice DeWine authored a dissent joined by then-Justice Kennedy, expressing\na view similar to the one advanced by former Chief Justice O\u2019Connor. See id. at\n\u00b6 52 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 17} In support of the court\u2019s judgment granting the writ, the lead opinion\nexplained that whereas the Westlake Charter uses the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d in\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nprescribing the practice-of-law requirement, it uses the phrase \u201cimmediately\npreceding\u201d in prescribing the residency requirement. Reasoning that the difference\nin wording must have been meant to convey a difference in meaning, the lead\nopinion inferred that the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d meant something different from\nthe phrase \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d especially because the two phrases appeared\nin \u201cclose proximity\u201d to each other. Id. at \u00b6 16. As the lead opinion put it, had the\ncharter\u2019s drafters intended to require candidates to have been engaged in the active\npractice of law during the six-year period immediately preceding the election at\nissue, they would have used wording to that effect, \u201c[b]ut they did not do so.\u201d Id.\nThe lead opinion also emphasized that under the charter, candidates had to have\npracticed law for \u201ca period of six (6) years\u201d rather than \u201cthe period of six (6) years.\u201d\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Id. at \u00b6 13, quoting Westlake Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 4.\nBecause \u201ca\u201d is an indefinite article conveying the sense of \u201cany,\u201d the lead opinion\nreasoned, the charter required only that candidates have been engaged in the\npractice of law for any six-year period preceding the election. See id. Last, the\nlead opinion invoked the policy principle that doubts should be resolved in favor of\nthose seeking office to enable the public to have the benefit of choice among all\nqualified persons. Id. at \u00b6 18.\n {\u00b6 18} The dissenters countered that the lead opinion\u2019s approach sapped the\nphrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d of its ordinary meaning. They pointed out that under\nseveral lexical sources, there was no linguistic daylight between \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38\n(DeWine, J., dissenting). As discussed below, they also observed that the Revised\nCode contains numerous instances in which it makes sense to construe \u201cnext\npreceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30-32\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 39-40 (DeWine, J., dissenting). And they also\nsaw a sensible policy reflected in their construction of the charter\u2014namely, that the\nvoters would be better served by a candidate currently engaged in the practice of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nlaw than by one whose practice had lain dormant. Id. at \u00b6 33 (O\u2019Connor, C.J.,\ndissenting); id. at \u00b6 51 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 19} The above discussion of Rocco raises the question whether we\nshould follow the lead opinion\u2019s analysis or the dissenters\u2019.1 A plurality opinion\ndoes not constitute binding authority, but a court may rely on a plurality opinion if\nit finds the opinion to be persuasive. NASCAR Holdings, Inc. v. Testa, 2017-Ohio-\n9118, \u00b6 18. For the reasons explained below, we decline to follow the Rocco lead\nopinion here.\n {\u00b6 20} As noted above, general rules of statutory interpretation apply in\ndiscerning the meaning of a city charter. Miller, 2021-Ohio-831, at \u00b6 33. Foremost\namong these rules is that \u201c\u2018[t]he words of a governing text are of paramount\nconcern, and what they convey, in their context, is what the text means.\u2019 \u201d State v.\nReed, 2020-Ohio-4255, \u00b6 17, quoting Scalia and Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts, 56 (2012). In the absence of a legislative definition\nor technical meaning, it is proper to use dictionaries to discern a word\u2019s plain and\nordinary meaning. See Rancho Cincinnati Rivers, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, 2021-Ohio-2798, \u00b6 21; see also Athens v. McClain, 2020-Ohio-5146, \u00b6 30\n(\u201cIn determining the \u2018common and ordinary meaning\u2019 of words, courts may look to\ndictionaries.\u201d); State v. Wells, 2001-Ohio-3, \u00b6 8 (\u201cTo determine the common,\neveryday meaning of a word, we have consistently used dictionary definitions.\u201d).\n {\u00b6 21} The lead opinion in Rocco strayed from these principles. As the\ndissenters noted, the lead opinion did not even try to discover the plain and ordinary\nmeaning of the words \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d Rocco, 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 27\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 43 (DeWine, J., dissenting). Rather, the lead\nopinion inferred that because the Westlake Charter used the phrases \u201cimmediately\n\n1. Although the Rocco lead opinion was followed in State ex rel. Nasal v. Miami Cty. Bd. of\nElections, 2021-Ohio-2993, \u00b6 10, and State ex rel. Emhoff v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2018-\nOhio-1660, \u00b6 20, Nasal was a plurality decision and Emhoff relied on Rocco\u2019s practice-of-law\nanalysis, which is not an issue in this case.\n\f January Term, 2025\n\npreceding\u201d and \u201cnext preceding\u201d in close proximity to each other, the phrases must\nhave different meanings. Before drawing this inference, however, the lead opinion\nshould have first consulted proper lexical sources to determine the meaning of\n\u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d See Rancho at \u00b6 21. Doing so establishes that \u201cnext\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately\u201d are synonymous, as the dissenters carefully demonstrated.\n {\u00b6 22} One source cited by the dissenters defined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38 (DeWine, J.,\ndissenting), citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002). Another\ndefined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201c[n]earest; closest; immediately following.\u201d (Emphasis in\noriginal.) Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting), citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n(6th Ed. 1990). And a thesaurus identified \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d as synonyms\nof \u201cnearest.\u201d Id., citing Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (4th Ed. 1977). What is\nmore, as Justice DeWine observed, decisions by Ohio courts pointed in the same\ndirection, deeming \u201cnext preceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 41 (DeWine, J., dissenting), citing Cincinnati v. Kirk, 20 Ohio\nApp. 452, 453 (1st Dist. 1925), and Mansfield v. Hunt, 10 Ohio C.D. 567, 569, 1900\nWL 1068 (5th Dist. 1900). The lead opinion failed to furnish any lexical authorities\nor decisions by Ohio courts cutting the other way. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 23} Citing several examples, the dissenters also showed that the Revised\nCode uses \u201cnext preceding\u201d synonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\nConsider two. First, Chief Justice O\u2019Connor cited a statute requiring prior notice\nof public auctions of personal property by either or both of two methods: (1) by\nplacing notice of the sale in a \u201c\u2018newspaper of general circulation in the county\nduring a period of fifteen days next preceding the sale\u2019 \u201d and/or (2) by posting an\nadvertisement in five public places where the sale would take place \u201c\u2018not less than\nfifteen days next preceding the sale.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 30 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting),\nquoting R.C. 2113.41(A). In either event, the property had to be sold \u201c\u2018at a fixed\nprice or for the best price obtainable.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting R.C. 2113.40. As Chief Justice\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nO\u2019Connor observed, under the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnext preceding,\u201d\nnotice of the auction could be provided years in advance. But that outcome would\nplainly frustrate the statute\u2019s goal of ensuring attendance at the auction and\nconcomitantly drive down the auction prices.\n {\u00b6 24} A second example of the Revised Code\u2019s use of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nsynonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d can be found in Justice DeWine\u2019s\nRocco dissent, which cites a statute concerning watershed-district budgets. He\nnoted that the statute\u2019s third paragraph requires certification of an annual budget to\nthe county commissioners and that its fourth paragraph directs the county\ncommissioners to perform specified duties \u201c\u2018[u]pon receipt of the certification\nunder the next preceding paragraph of this section.\u2019 \u201d Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 40\n(DeWine, J., dissenting), quoting R.C. 6105.08. Reading the two paragraphs\ntogether, Justice DeWine explained, \u201c[t]he fourth paragraph makes sense only if\n\u2018the next preceding paragraph\u2019 is the third paragraph, i.e., the immediately\npreceding paragraph.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 25} Unlike the dissents, the lead opinion in Rocco offers no examples\nfrom the Revised Code to support its interpretation of the Westlake Charter\nprovision at issue. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 26} The above discussion establishes that \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d and\n\u201cnext preceding\u201d are synonyms, and it undercuts the view expressed in the Rocco\nlead opinion that the phrases must have different meanings based on the canon\nknown as the presumption of consistent usage. That canon provides that \u201ca material\nvariation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.\u201d (Boldface deleted.) Reading\nLaw at 170. But although this court has invoked the canon in numerous decisions,\nsee, e.g., Metro. Secs. Co. v. Warren State Bank, 117 Ohio St. 69, 76 (1927); Obetz\nv. McClain, 2021-Ohio-1706, \u00b6 21, it is not ironclad. As Justice DeWine pointed\nout, the canon has been frowned on by no less than the late Justice Joseph Story of\nthe United States Supreme Court. Rocco at \u00b6 46 (DeWine, J., dissenting) (noting\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nthe criticism that the canon assumes an unrealistic level of perfection in legal\ndrafting). As with most canons, the presumption of consistent usage makes sense\nwhen applied \u201cpragmatically\u201d but may be overcome \u201cby context.\u201d Reading Law at\n171. For the reasons given in the dissenting opinions of Chief Justice O\u2019Connor\nand Justice DeWine, context should have trumped the presumption in Rocco.\n {\u00b6 27} Applying the logic of the Rocco dissenters here, we conclude that\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter requires that ward candidates for the\nWhitehall City Council have resided in their respective wards for at least the two\nyears immediately preceding the election at issue. The fact that Section 23(a) of\nthe charter specifies that mayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City\nfor three years immediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they\nseek election\u201d does not, as respondents argue, require a different result. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondents\u2019 view is that had the drafters of the charter intended to require\nward candidates to have been residents of their respective wards for a period of time\nimmediately prior to the election, as the charter provides with respect to mayoral\ncandidates, the drafters would have used wording to that effect. But that argument,\nwhich appeals to the presumption of consistent usage, fails for all the reasons\nexplained above. Moreover, unlike in Rocco, (1) the two competing phrases here\nare not in close proximity to each other and (2) Section 3(a) does not place the\nindefinite article \u201ca\u201d directly before the phrase \u201cnext preceding.\u201d Thus, even if we\nconsidered the lead opinion in Rocco persuasive, the difference between the\nstructure of the charter at issue in that case and the structure of the charter at issue\nhere would counsel against reliance on that opinion in this case.\n {\u00b6 28} The fact that we do not apply the presumption of consistent usage in\nthis case does not mean that it may never be invoked in a future case. Rather, as\nthe dissenters in Rocco explained, there will be some cases\u2014like this one\u2014in\nwhich the canon should be set aside. Indeed, because \u201c[n]o canon of interpretation\nis absolute,\u201d the force of a canon in any particular case \u201cmay be overcome by the\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nstrength of differing principles that point in other directions.\u201d (Boldface deleted.)\nReading Law at 59.\n {\u00b6 29} In the end, it is plain to us that the board\u2019s denial of Elmore\u2019s protest\nwas unauthorized by law because it failed to give proper effect to Section 3(a) of\nthe Whitehall Charter. Because Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nmeans \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d we conclude that Stein had to have resided in\nWard 4 for at least the two years immediately preceding the November 4, 2025\ngeneral election. Because Stein does not meet this requirement, she cannot appear\non the general-election ballot.\n B. Determining to whom the two-year residency requirement applies\n {\u00b6 30} Stein alone advances a more ambitious argument as to why we\nshould deny the writ. In her view, the two-year residency requirement of Section\n3(a) of the Whitehall Charter does not apply to her at all; rather, she says that the\nrequirement applies only to candidates running to be at-large members of the city\ncouncil. According to Stein, the requirement does not apply to ward candidates,\nbecause of the \u201cand\u201d that separates the reference to ward candidates from the\nreference to at-large candidates. By this logic, Stein need only have resided in\nWard 4 at some point in time for any period\u2014say, a day\u2014to qualify as a Ward 4\ncandidate. Because the parties do not dispute that Stein has previously resided in\nWard 4, adopting her argument would mean that her name should remain certified\nfor placement on the ballot.\n {\u00b6 31} Although courts use rules of grammar to determine the meaning of\nlegal texts, see Stiner v. Amazon, Inc., 2020-Ohio-4632, \u00b6 14, Stein fails to identify\na grammar principle that we could apply here to help determine whether, as she\nsays, the residency requirement modifies only the clause applicable to at-large\ncandidates. Instructive here is the series-qualifier canon, which provides that\n\u201c[w]hen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or\nverbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nentire series\u201d (boldface deleted), Reading Law at 147. The Reading Law treatise\noffers an illustration of this canon, explaining that the phrase \u201c[i]nstitutions or\nsocieties that are charitable in nature\u201d (italics deleted) should be understood as\nmeaning that \u201cthe institutions as well as the societies must be charitable.\u201d Id. at\n148 (calling this an example of a \u201cpostpositive modifier\u201d because the qualifying\nphrase is \u201cpositioned after\u201d what it modifies). Providing a second illustration, the\ntreatise says that a qualifying phrase should not carry over when a \u201cdeterminer (a,\nthe, some, etc.) [is] repeated before the second element.\u201d (Italics in original.) Id.\nThus, the phrase \u201c[t]he charitable institutions or the societies\u201d (italics deleted)\nshould be understood as meaning \u201cthat the societies need not be charitable\u201d due to\nthe presence of the second \u201cthe.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 32} In this case, Section 3(a)\u2019s constructions are parallel and there is no\ndeterminer before the second element, thus suggesting that the two-year residency\nrequirement applies both to ward candidates and to at-large candidates. We\nrecognize that Section 3(a) arguably does not fit neatly within the canon\u2019s technical\ndefinition, because the constructions at issue here are wordier than the examples in\nthe treatise and are not strictly composed of either all nouns or verbs in a series.\nBut another example, aided by a dose of pragmatism, helps explain why the\nunderlying logic of the canon should nonetheless apply here.\n {\u00b6 33} Suppose a school administrator were to say: \u201cMiddle-school\nstudents scheduled to participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their\nanswers at the microphone in room 101 and elementary-school students scheduled\nto participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their answers at the\nmicrophone in room 102 without the aid of a dictionary.\u201d It makes no sense to\nthink that the middle-school students are permitted to announce their answers by\nreading from a dictionary but that the elementary-school students are not. By\nsimilar logic, it makes no sense to think that Section 3(a) permits interloping ward\ncandidates but forbids interloping at-large candidates. Plainly, both types of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\ncandidates are expected to be responsive to their constituents and attuned to their\ninterests, and the two-year residency requirement promotes that goal.\n {\u00b6 34} In sum, we conclude that the two-year residency requirement of\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter applies both to ward candidates and to at-\nlarge candidates for the Whitehall City Council.\n III. CONCLUSION\n {\u00b6 35} Because Stein\u2019s candidacy does not comply with Section 3(a) of the\nWhitehall Charter, we grant a writ of prohibition preventing the board from placing\nher name on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot.\n Writ granted.\n _________________\n McTigue & Colombo, L.L.C., J.

    "text": "07/23/2025\n IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\n AT KNOXVILLE\n Assigned on Briefs June 3, 2025\n\nIN RE KENNA R., ET AL.\n\nAppeal from the Juvenile Court for Hawkins County\n No. HJ-22-0437 William Erwin Phillips, II, Judge\n\nNo. E2024-00181-COA-R3-PT\n\nThis appeal concerns termination of parental rights. The Tennessee Department of\nChildren\u2019s Services (\u201cDCS\u201d) filed a petition in the Juvenile Court for Hawkins County\n(\u201cthe Juvenile Court\u201d) seeking to terminate the parental rights of Rikiya P. (\u201cMother\u201d) to\nher minor children Annabelle, Jasmine, and Liam (\u201cthe Children,\u201d collectively), as well as\nthe parental rights of Daniel R. (\u201cFather\u201d) to Liam.1 The Children had been removed from\nMother and Father\u2019s custody because Mother starved and beat Kenna, Father\u2019s daughter\nby another mother.2 Father was aware of the abuse but failed to protect Kenna. The\nJuvenile Court terminated Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of severe\nchild abuse. Mother and Father appeal. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground\nof severe child abuse was proven against Mother and Father by clear and convincing\nevidence. We find further, as did the Juvenile Court, that clear and convincing evidence\nsupports termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as being in the best interest\nof the Children. We affirm.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Juvenile Court Affirmed;\n Case Remanded\n\nD. MICHAEL SWINEY, C.J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J. STEVEN\nSTAFFORD, P.J., W.S., and W. NEAL MCBRAYER, J., joined.\n Aaron P. is the father of Annabelle and Jasmine. Aaron P.\u2019s parental rights were terminated, and he\nappealed. Subsequently, counsel for Aaron P. filed a motion in this Court seeking dismissal of the appeal\nbased on his client\u2019s lack of participation. We granted the motion and dismissed this appeal as to Aaron P.\nIn this Opinion, we address only Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights. We mention Aaron P. only as\nnecessary to set out the factual background. In addition, as this is a parental rights case, we refrain from\nusing the full names of children and their relatives.\n Kenna has since reached majority age.\n\fNicholas S. Davenport, V, Kingsport, Tennessee, for the appellant, Rikiya P.\n\nEmily C. Morley, Rogersville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Daniel R.3\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter, and Mara L. Cunningham, Assistant\nAttorney General, for the appellee, the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services.\n\nOPINION\n\nBackground\n\nMother is the mother of Annabelle, born May 2013; Jasmine, born June 2014; and\nLiam, born December 2019. Aaron P. is the father of Annabelle and Jasmine. Father is\nthe father of Liam. Father has an older daughter, Kenna, by another mother. At the\ninception of this case, Mother, Father, Aaron P., the Children, and Kenna all lived under\nthe same roof. In May 2021, Kenna, then age sixteen, tried to run away. A neighbor\nstopped Kenna and returned her. Law enforcement later performed a welfare check but\ndid not see Kenna. That night, law enforcement returned. Mother and Father told the\nofficers that Kenna was away visiting a relative. That was false. Law enforcement found\nKenna hiding under a bed. She was bruised, emaciated, and had a shaved head. Afterward,\nthe Children and Kenna were removed into state custody. DCS filed a petition for\ndependency and neglect, but it was never adjudicated.\n\nOn May 25, 2022, DCS filed a petition seeking to terminate Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s\nparental rights to their respective children. Kenna has since reached majority age. DCS\nproceeded against Mother and Father on the ground of severe child abuse. Trial on DCS\u2019s\npetition was on November 29, November 30, and December 1, 2023. We proceed to review\nthe pertinent testimony from trial. Both Mother and Father declined to testify, invoking\ntheir rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nDr. Andrew Steven Wilt (\u201cDr. Wilt\u201d), an expert witness and the doctor who treated\nKenna after her removal, testified by deposition. Kenna suffered from \u201csevere\nmalnutrition.\u201d Kenna\u2019s weight for her age was less than the bottom first percentile, as was\nher body mass index. Dr. Wilt said it was most medically reasonable that Kenna\u2019s\nmalnutrition was not due to anything Kenna had done to herself but was the result of her\nbeing denied enough food. Kenna weighed 83 pounds when she was admitted to the\nhospital. Kenna had shown signs of \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d in which a malnourished\nperson does not properly handle the reintroduction of proper nutrients, which in turn can\n Father\u2019s previous attorney, Gerald T. Eidson, submitted Father\u2019s appellate brief.\n -2-\n\flead to death. In addition to starvation, Kenna showed signs of having been abused\nphysically, including facial bruising; a subconjunctival hemorrhage (a bleed in the white\npart of one\u2019s eye); bruises on her back; and bruises on her scapula. Kenna told Dr. Wilt\nthat Mother had hit her with a broom and a dustpan. Kenna also reported that she had lived\nunder strict rules about eating and drinking. For breakfast, she tended to have pack of\noatmeal. She was allowed to eat ramen or Chef Boyardee for lunch and dinner. Despite\nthese meager offerings, Kenna remained hungry. When the home ran out of oatmeal, she\nwas given a protein drink instead. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s malnourishment was\nsuch that it was likely to cause severe bodily injury or death. In Dr. Wilt\u2019s view, a\nreasonably prudent medical professional who saw Kenna in the condition she was in would\nhave made a referral.\n\nLisa Hawryluk (\u201cHawryluk\u201d), a DCS caseworker, took the stand to testify. Father\ntold Hawryluk that Kenna had done this to them, and he did not want her back in his home.\nMother likewise blamed Kenna. The thrust of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s positions was that\nthe family\u2019s problems were brought about by Kenna\u2019s bad behavior, not their parenting.\nHawryluk said that Kenna, now out of the family home, was glad to drink something\nbesides water and consumed whatever was given to her. On cross-examination, Hawryluk\nacknowledged that the Children appeared clean and did not have any marks visible.\n\nRetired detective Jeff Greer (\u201cGreer\u201d) testified. Greer saw Kenna at Mother\u2019s and\nFather\u2019s home in her malnourished state. Kenna appeared \u201cvery emaciated\u201d to Greer. She\nwas bruised around one eye and her head. According to Greer, the other children did not\nlook emaciated. Father told Greer that Kenna \u201creally didn\u2019t eat,\u201d but admitted they used\nfood as a punishment. Mother, in turn, told Greer that Kenna refused to eat. Corporal\nAnthony Crosby (\u201cCrosby\u201d) of the Hawkins County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified, as well.\nCrosby said that Kenna looked \u201cseverely abused.\u201d She had a black eye and looked like she\nwas \u201cliterally starving to death.\u201d\n\nConstance Cole (\u201cCole\u201d), a former DCS worker, testified next. Cole previously\nworked on the Children\u2019s case. Cole said that the Children were placed in a home together\nwhile Kenna was placed in a separate home. Cole acknowledged that Mother and Father\nhave a parental attachment to the Children but said that it is not of a healthy kind.\nAnnabelle broke down and cried at the first parental visitation. Cole said that she did not\nbelieve this was due to Annabelle missing her parents. In fact, Annabelle said that she was\nscared because \u201cthey beated me.\u201d However, Cole acknowledged that some of the visits\nwent well. Visitation remained supervised. Annabelle and Jasmine told Cole that they\nwere fearful of returning home. Annabelle and Jasmine said that the parents had been mean\nto Kenna. With respect to positive steps taken by Mother and Father, Cole testified that\nthey had housing and jobs. They also underwent parenting classes. All the same, in Cole\u2019s\nview, the Children should be freed for adoption. Cole explained why this was her view:\n -3-\n\f The abuse that Kenna received while in their care. I would be afraid that\n other children would face that same abuse and the older they get they would\n face the same abuse and it was horrific. Every time I met with Kenna she\n was vibrant and I never saw the things that were described to me by the\n Defendants in her. I never saw the attitudes or any of that in her. I saw a\n thriving young lady. I would be fearful for the other children.\n\nSchool counselor Jason Floyd (\u201cFloyd\u201d) testified. Regarding Annabelle and\nJasmine, Floyd said: \u201cOn a couple occasions separately and every now and again they\nwould want to come in together. They would say they are starving us and not giving us\nany food. When I would ask questions to explore that further they wouldn\u2019t say anything\nelse.\u201d Floyd said that Annabelle was very anxious early on, and Jasmine exhibited\ndisruptive behaviors. In addition, Tracy Burke (\u201cBurke\u201d), a CASA volunteer who worked\nwith the Children, testified. Annabelle told Burke that Mother pulled her hair, slapped her\nin the face or legs, and withheld food from her. Even still, Annabelle said that this was\n\u201cnothing like what they had seen done to Kenna.\u201d Annabelle also reported that Father once\npulled a gun on Kenna.\n\nLarissa J., Kenna\u2019s foster mother, testified.4 Kenna came to live with Larissa J. in\nMay 2021. According to Larissa J., Kenna initially looked \u201cvery frail and skinny.\u201d\nKenna\u2019s head was shaved, and she had a lot of bruises. When Kenna came to live with\nLarissa J., she ate regularly. Kenna then weighed between 80 and 90 pounds. Since then,\nshe has risen to around 140 pounds. Larissa J. enrolled Kenna in school. Kenna did not\nhave any high school credits when she was enrolled. Nevertheless, Kenna has since\ngraduated and has a job.\n\nKenna testified next. Kenna, age 19 at trial, is Father\u2019s daughter. Kenna was asked\nto describe a typical day in Mother and Father\u2019s home. According to Kenna, she woke up\n\u201csuper early,\u201d went to the living room to sit all day, and then went to bed. Mother made\nKenna sit on the floor in a certain precise way as a form of punishment. If Kenna failed to\ndo so, Mother hit her or yelled at her. Kenna needed permission to use the restroom.\nOtherwise, an alarm went off signaling that she could go. Kenna had no television or\ncomputer. For breakfast, she had one bowl of plain oatmeal. This was not by Kenna\u2019s\nchoice. For lunch, she was allowed to have canned soup or Chef Boyardee. It was not\nheated; she had to eat it out of the can. Dinner was the same. If Kenna asked for more,\nMother yelled at her. Kenna could drink only water. Meanwhile, cameras monitored\nKenna in the home. Kenna testified that Father threatened her with a gun twice. Kenna\nwas asked if Father ever tried to protect her from Mother. Kenna said that Father did \u201ca\n Larissa J.\u2019s first name is spelled Larisa in some parts of the record.\n -4-\n\fcouple of times,\u201d but he told her it was not for her benefit, but to protect Mother from\ngetting in trouble.\n\nOn cross-examination, Kenna said that her own mother left her when she was a year\nor a year-and-a-half old, and Mother was at one time a mother figure to her. Asked why\nshe did not climb out of her bedroom window to find food, Kenna said that the window\nwas screwed shut. Kenna acknowledged certain correspondence in which she admitted to\nbeing stubborn. Kenna also said that Mother was \u201cjust a typical mom\u201d to Annabelle and\nJasmine.\n\nMike Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), the Children\u2019s DCS case manager, testified. Smith said that\nthe Children are doing well in foster care. Jasmine and Annabelle were two years behind\nin school, based on their prior lack of education. However, they have made significant\nimprovements. Regarding the Children\u2019s attachment to Mother and Father, Smith testified:\n\nQ. Would you be able to tell the Court if you believe there is a secure and\n healthy parental attachment between these children and the parents?\n A. This is a difficult situation. Annabelle and Jasmine both have disclosed\n that they both don\u2019t want to have any contact with their mother. There are\n certainly concerns there. They both have disclosed that they love their father\n and they would like to see their father. I have seen an attachment there in\n those visits. Liam due to his age obviously he recognizes his mother and\n father. He likes seeing them and he is excited to see them. The question I\n have wondered about with the attachment factor with Liam and generally\n when I see a two or three year old at the end of visits whenever there is some\n kind of separation from the visits a child will normally scream, cry, it is\n usually a traumatic experience to separate the child from the visit. We never\n have that issue with Liam. He is happy to go. He is happy to come and\n happy to go. That has always been an odd situation.\n\nSmith testified that while Father was engaged during the visits, Mother tended to\nuse her phone on the couch. Smith acknowledged that Mother and Father paid child\nsupport. Asked if Mother or Father had undergone a mental health intake, Smith said:\n\nThere is some question with that. I have requested documentation. It is not\n to my liking but it is to her credit, [Mother] has sent me a screen shot of a\n piece of paper from her therapist, but as far as ongoing or what is being\n discussed in therapy, I don\u2019t have any knowledge of it. [Father] has reported\n that he is going to Camelot. I haven\u2019t had any verification from that. I think\n it was Camelot and I may be mistaken as far as the provider but he has\n reported that he is receiving therapy. . . .\n -5-\n\fAt a February 2023 visit, Jasmine locked herself in a bathroom crying that Mother abused\nthem. Jasmine threatened to kill herself. She also threatened to stab Mother if she had to\nsee her again. After this incident, Jasmine spent a week in the hospital. Mother\u2019s visits\nwith Annabelle and Jasmine were suspended.\n\nNext at trial, Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s employer testified favorably about Mother and\nFather. In addition, Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., testified favorably about Mother and\nFather, as well. Pamela P. testified, in effect, that Kenna\u2019s bad behavior was the problem\nin the household, not Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parenting. When confronted with photographs\nof Kenna, Pamela P. testified:\n\nQ. You stated that you left in March, 2021, is that correct?\n A. That\u2019s correct.\n Q. Can you look at this picture and see if that is how Kenna looked when you\n left?\n A. Well, she has her pick marks. I was not here for this picture and that\n timing exactly. I have seen her have injuries before from nobody being at\n home.\n THE COURT: She asked you if that is how she looked when you left?\n A. When I last saw her?\n THE COURT: Yes.\n A. No. She was thin and she had pick marks but, no, I didn\u2019t see this.\n THE COURT: Thank you.\n Q. Same thing. Did she look like this when you left? Is that her haircut that\n she had when you left?\n A. No, Ma\u2019am, but it is the haircut she described that she wanted.\n Q. Oh, it is?\n A. Yes.\n Q. Okay, that is what she said she wanted her hair to look like?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. Okay, thank you. Did she have black eyes when you last saw her and is\n that an injury she would have inflicted upon herself?\n A. Twice. One time she had one black eye and the second time she had two\n and no one was there all day. She didn\u2019t expect to see me.\n Q. Did you ask her about her injuries?\n A. Oh, I had an accident and she would go hide in her room.\n Q. Are you aware that both Annabelle and Jasmine have made statements\n that they also had food restrictions in the home of your daughter?\n A. I am not aware but I know better.\n Q. You don\u2019t believe the children are saying that?\n -6-\n\f A. I believe I have broken children that never got the help they wanted and\n they could be coerced in any way.\n Q. You believe these children are being coerced?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. What evidence do you have of them being coerced?\n A. What evidence do I have?\n Q. Yes.\n A. I can\u2019t state because it is evidenced presented through other people.\n Q. You can\u2019t state?\n THE COURT: You can answer her question, Ma\u2019am.\n A. Why do I think so because other people have told me and I know the kids\n are broken and I have been told in the past that they are in fear of everything\n going on and they can be coerced. I know they always had plenty of food.\n\nIn January 2024, the Juvenile Court entered its final order in which it terminated\nMother\u2019s parental rights to the Children and Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. The Juvenile\nCourt found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the ground of severe child abuse had\nbeen proven against both Mother and Father. The Juvenile Court also found that clear and\nconvincing evidence supported termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as\nbeing in the Children\u2019s best interest. The Juvenile Court specifically found Kenna to be a\ncredible witness. The Juvenile Court also credited the testimony of witnesses Hawryluk,\nGreer, Crosby, Larissa J., Cole, Floyd, Burke, and Smith. By contrast, the Juvenile Court\nspecifically found the testimony of Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., in which she blamed\nKenna for the family\u2019s situation, not credible. In its detailed Memorandum Opinion\nincorporated into its termination order, the Juvenile Court found, in relevant part:\n\nOn May 17, 2021, Kenna was 16 years old, and had been living . . .\n with her father, two other adults, and three younger children. When law\n enforcement discovered Kenna under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed they knew\n immediately from her appearance and condition that she needed medical\n attention. Kenna looked emaciated, as if she was \u201cstarving to death.\u201d She\n had bruising on her face and head, and she had a bizarre haircut.\n Kenna was transported by ambulance to Hawkins County Memorial\n Hospital, and then to Johnson City Medical Center, where law enforcement\u2019s\n observations were confirmed. When Kenna arrived at JCMC she appeared\n visibly dirty, malnourished and bruised. Her appearance was described by\n Dr. Wilt as \u201cwasted or cachectic.\u201d Her ribs were visible, and her hips and\n spine were protruding. In addition to the bruising on her face and head, she\n had bruising down her back and on her shoulder blades. Upon admission,\n Kenna was approximately 5\u2019 6\u201d tall, and weighed 83 pounds. Kenna was\n diagnosed as being severely malnourished due to caloric restriction by the\n -7-\n\fcaregivers in her home. Her malnourishment was so severe that her life was\nat risk from refeeding syndrome. Even in the face of Kenna\u2019s wasted\nappearance, and her obvious need for immediate medical care, Respondents\ncould not recall the last time she had seen a doctor and did not seek medical\nhelp.\n Kenna has also consistently recounted her physical and emotional\nabuse at the hands of Respondents: from being beaten by [Mother]; to being\nthreatened with a hand gun by [Father]; to having her sense of femininity\nsheared away by [Aaron P.]. It is evident to the Court that all three\nrespondents actively participated in her systematic starvation, and in her\nextreme isolation. This evidence was uncontested at trial, and the Court finds\nby a preponderance of the evidence that Kenna suffered from abuse and\nneglect.\n\n***\n\nKenna suffered no burns at the hands of Respondents. No evidence\nwas presented at trial that Kenna suffered any broken bones, or a concussion.\nThe Court does find, however, that being struck in the head by [Mother] with\nher fists and a broom was likely to cause a broken nose or concussion. No\nevidence was introduced that the child suffered subdural bleeding, cerebral\nedema, or a brain contusion. Upon her admission to JCMC, Kenna did have\na subconjunctival hemorrhage. Kenna did have deeply disturbing bruising\non her face and head, and along her spinal column and across her shoulders.\nWhile Kenna was defeminized by her forced haircut, it did not result in\npermanent or protracted disfigurement. Kenna did report that [Mother] had\nhit her with a broom, a bowl, and a belt. Still, Kenna\u2019s wasted condition does\nnot quite fit squarely within any of the abhorrent injuries specifically detailed\nin the statutory definition. The Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d\nelement, however, does not end there.\n While the statutory definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d includes\nspecific examples, it is \u201cnot limited to\u201d those listed examples. Our Supreme\nCourt has held that the words \u201cincludes, but not limited to\u201d are terms of\nenlargement, not terms of restriction. See Lovlace v Copley, 418 S.W.3d 1,\n18 (Tenn. 2013). This language allows a court to employ its aforementioned\ncommon sense to determine whether an injury suffered by a child can\nreasonably be defined as a serious bodily injury. As such, the Court finds\nthat any reasonable person would conclude that a child who is so severely\nmalnourished that she requires hospitalization and medically monitored\nnourishment, has sustained a serious bodily injury. Accordingly, the Court\n\n-8-\n\ffinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the abuse and neglect suffered\nby Kenna was likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n Likewise, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nabuse and neglect suffered by Kenna was likely to cause death. Kenna\u2019s\nmalnourishment was so severe that she exhibited signs of refeeding\nsyndrome, which poses a severe risk of death. Dr. Wilt testified\nunequivocally that Kenna\u2019s severe malnourishment was likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nPerhaps the most damning evidence of Respondents\u2019 knowing\nexposure of Kenna to severe abuse is the fact that they tried to hide her from\nthe authorities. When a Sheriff\u2019s deputy first responded to the residence for\na welfare check, [Aaron P.] told Kenna to hide under his bed, and told law\nenforcement she was not there. When authorities returned to the residence,\nKenna was again told to hide under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed, and [Mother] and\n[Father] lied about Kenna\u2019s whereabouts. Respondents\u2019 actions clearly\nbetray a consciousness of guilt. They knew that Kenna\u2019s discovery by\nauthorities would reveal the abuse they had inflicted on her. The Court,\ntherefore, finds by clear and convincing evidence that [Father], [Mother], and\n[Aaron P.] each knowingly exposed Kenna to abuse or neglect likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n Furthermore, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n[Father] and [Mother] used force on Kenna likely to cause serious bodily\ninjury or death. As discussed above, [Mother] used her hands and objects,\nsuch as a broom, to strike Kenna in the face and head. This force was likely\nto cause a broken bone or concussion. Additionally, the uncontradicted\nevidence at trial was that [Father] twice threatened Kenna with a gun; on one\noccasion pointing a loaded gun at her forehead and stating, \u201cI want to shoot\nyou.\u201d There is no doubt in the Court\u2019s mind that this behavior constitutes a\nuse of force likely to result in serious bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nThe Court, having addressed the underlying facts and elements of the\nstatutory ground of severe child abuse, must now address the ground itself.\n\u201cOnce these specific underlying facts are established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, the court must step back to look at the combined weight of all\nof those facts, to see if they clearly and convincingly show severe child\nabuse.\u201d Id. at 457 quoting In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 591-592 (Tenn. App.\n\n-9-\n\f2012). The Court finds that the Department has proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] have\ncommitted severe child abuse as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102.\n\n***\n\n[Best Interest]\n\n(A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the\nchild\u2019s critical need for stability and continuity of placement throughout\nthe child\u2019s minority. None of the children are currently in an adoptive\nplacement. The children have also been removed from Respondents\u2019 custody\nfor more than two and a half years. Respondents\u2019 therapeutic visitation has\nnever been increased. In fact, [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was\nsuspended at the time of trial. There has never been a trial home placement,\nor even unsupervised visitation. Considering that Respondents\u2019 case for a\nreturn of custody has not advanced at all in more than two and a half years,\nthe instant termination of their parental rights will free the children for\nadoption and perhaps facilitate a pre-adoptive placement. This factor weighs\nin favor of the termination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is\nlikely to have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical\ncondition. A return of Jasmine and Annabelle to the custody of [Mother]\nand/or [Aaron P.] would have a negative effect on their emotional and\npsychological condition. Both girls were present in the home when Kenna\nwas being severely abused. Jasmine witnessed her mother pulling Kenna\u2019s\nhair, and Kenna screaming. She witnessed her mother yelling at Kenna to sit\ncorrectly. Annabelle also witnessed the severe abuse of Kenna. She\ndescribed scary events, and recounted her own maltreatment. At the prospect\nof a visit with her parents, Jasmine threatened to hurt herself and her mother,\nresulting in her admission to Woodridge Psychiatric Hospital. Annabelle did\nnot want to visit with her parents, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic\nstress disorder. All of these facts were uncontradicted by [Mother] and\n[Aaron P.] at trial. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the termination\nof [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n There was no evidence presented at trial regarding Liam\u2019s emotional,\npsychological, or medical condition, likely due to his young age. The Court\nis unable to make a factual finding regarding what effect a change of\ncaretakers would have on Liam. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\nagainst the termination of [Father\u2019s] or [Mother\u2019s] parental rights to Liam.\n\n-10-\n\f (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability\nin meeting the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety\nneeds. Respondents have not had a meaningful opportunity to meet these\nneeds in more than two and a half years. Of course, the children\u2019s removal\nwas the result of Respondents\u2019 own actions. The evidence is undisputed that\nat the time of their removal, the children subject to this petition appeared\nwell. They did not appear malnourished; they were not bruised like Kenna.\nThe evidence is also undisputed that prior to their removal they were\nallegedly being home schooled with a curriculum not accredited in\nTennessee, and that they were educationally behind. It is equally undisputed\nthat when in Respondents\u2019 custody, the children lived in a home of casual\nviolence and abuse. A home in which adults assault, threaten and abuse one\nchild does not meet the safety needs of any child. This factor weighs in favor\nof termination of all Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy\nparental attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable\nexpectation that the parent can create such attachment. As already\ndiscussed, the evidence presented at trial clearly establishes that neither\n[Mother] nor [Aaron P.] have a secure and healthy parental attachment with\nJasmine or Annabelle. Moreover, neither [Mother] nor [Aaron P.] testified\nregarding their attachment with, or love for, their children, or how they\nexpect to recreate that relationship. There was simply no evidence\nintroduced at trial that would allow the Court to conclude that there is a\nreasonable expectation that [Mother] or [Aaron P.] can create a healthy\nparental attachment with Annabelle or Jasmine. The undisputed evidence\nsuggests the opposite.\n At the time of trial, Liam was nearly four years old. He has been\nremoved from his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s custody for significantly more than\nhalf his young life. Again, neither [Father] nor [Mother] elected to testify\nregarding their parental attachment with or love for Liam, or how they hope\nto create such attachment. This factor weighs in favor of the termination of\nall Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other\ncontact with the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate\na positive relationship with the child. The evidence at trial establishes that,\nwhen available, Respondents regularly attended therapeutic visitation with\nthe children, and that Respondents behavior during the visits was largely\nappropriate. [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was suspended in 2023,\nthough the suspension does not appear to have resulted from their behavior\nat the visit. As of trial, [Father] was still attending visits with Liam.\n\n-11-\n\f With regard to [Mother] and [Aaron P.], this factor weighs neither in\nfavor of nor against termination. With regard to [Father], this factor weighs\nagainst termination.\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home. The\nevidence presented at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and\nAnnabelle are fearful of their parents. Jasmine was so fearful of a visit that\nshe credibly threated [sic] to hurt herself and her mother, requiring her\nadmission to a psychiatric hospital. Annabelle has consistently maintained\nthat she does not want to see her parents, and she has been diagnosed with\npost-traumatic stress disorder. While [Father] is not the father of Jasmine or\nAnnabelle, the Court has no doubt their fear also extends to him. There was\nno evidence introduced at trial that Liam was in fear of his parents.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s\nhousehold trigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or\npost-traumatic symptoms. Much as in the previous factor, the evidence\nintroduced at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and Annabelle are\nterrified of all Respondents. There is simply no question that Respondents\ntrigger and exacerbate the girls\u2019 experience of trauma and post-traumatic\nsymptoms. The Court does not have to speculate, as there is undisputed\nevidence of this actually happening. Again, there was no evidence presented\nat trial that would allow the Court to make this same conclusion with regard\nto Liam.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment\nwith another person or persons in the absence of the parent. The children\nare not in a pre-adoptive home. There was no evidence introduced at trial\nthat the children had developed a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson who is still involved in their care in the absence of the parent. The\nchildren had become attached with their initial foster parent who had hoped\nto adopt them, but due to the development of a serious illness was no longer\nable to care for them. Still, the children do not have a healthy attachment\nwith Respondents. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor against\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n\n-12-\n\f (I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships\nwith persons other than parents and caregivers, including biological or\nfoster siblings, and the likely impact of various available outcomes on\nthese relationships and the child\u2019s access to information about the\nchild\u2019s heritage. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle have been placed together\nsince their removal from Respondents more than two and a half years ago.\nThere is direct evidence that Jasmine and Annabelle rely on their relationship\nfor comfort and safety. Their school counsellor, Mr. Floyd, testified that the\nchildren would want to meet with him together. Annabelle scolds her CAC\ninterviewer that she and Jasmine could have been interviewed together. It is\nevident to the Court that this sibling relationship is paramount, and is\nessential to the best interest of all three children. Indeed, their relationship\nwith each other has been the only constant in their lives. This factor weighs\nheavily in favor of the Court\u2019s decision being uniform for all three children.\n (J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and\nbeneficial for the child to be in the home of the parent, including\nconsideration of whether there is criminal activity in the home or by the\nparent, or the use of alcohol, controlled substances, or controlled\nsubstance analogues which may render the parent unable to consistently\ncare for the child in a safe and stable manner. No evidence was presented\nthat Respondents had issues with substance abuse. There was testimony that\nRespondents had largely completed the actions steps set forth for them by\nthe Department. There was some dispute as to whether Respondents had\ncompleted a mental health assessment. Of course, Respondents could have\naddressed this question had they elected to testify. They could have also\nintroduced confirming documentation. They did neither. More importantly,\nRespondents did not testify that they had made a lasting adjustment regarding\ntheir abusive conduct, or even deny that such conduct ever happened. There\nis simply no evidence that allows the Court to conclude, in the face of\nundisputed evidence that Respondents severely abused Kenna, that the\nchildren would be safe in their parents\u2019 home. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available\nprograms, services, or community resources to assist in making a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions. The Court\u2019s\nassessment of this factor mirrors that of factor (J). While Respondents\nlargely completed the action steps set forth by the Department, no\ndocumentary evidence was submitted as an exhibit, and there was no\ntestimony that Respondents have made a lasting adjustment to their abusive\nconduct which resulted in the removal of the children from their custody.\n -13-\n\fThe undisputed testimony at trial was that Respondents refused to accept\nresponsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondent\u2019s parental rights.\n (L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist\nthe parent in making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in\nthe custody of the department. The Court cannot conclude from the\nevidence presented at trial that the Department made reasonable efforts to\nassist Respondents in making a lasting adjustment that would allow the return\nof the children. This factor weighs against termination of Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nestablishing paternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or\naddressing the circumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award\nof custody unsafe and not in the child\u2019s best interest. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nregaining custody of the children, or in addressing the undisputed abuse of\nKenna which led to the removal of the children in the first place.\nRespondents did not testify regarding any steps they had taken to regain\ncustody of the children. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\nRespondents refused to accept responsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This\nfactor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or\nfrequenting the home of the parent, has shown brutality or physical,\nsexual, emotional, or psychological abuse or neglect toward the child or\nany other child or adult. This Court has found by clear and convincing\nevidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] severely abused\nKenna. This factor weighs heavily in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for\nthe child or any other child. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle resided in a\nhome in which Respondents were severely abusing another child. Jasmine\nand Annabelle were twice removed from the custody of [Mother] and [Aaron\nP.] before their current removal. The Court simply cannot find that the\nchildren were ever provided safe and stable care by Respondents. This factor\nweighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the child to thrive. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the children to thrive. The undisputed\nevidence is that Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was\n\n-14-\n\f occurring, which has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n This factor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s\n basic and specific needs and in which the child can thrive. No evidence\n was presented at trial that Respondents demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating a home that meets the children\u2019s basic and specific\n needs and in which the children can thrive. The undisputed evidence is that\n Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was occurring, which\n has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs\n in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is\n healthy and safe for the child. There was no testimony or other evidence\n introduced at trial regarding the physical environment of any of\n Respondents\u2019 current homes. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\n against termination.\n (S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token\n financial support for the child. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\n Respondents paid their child support. The amount of support was not\n identified. This factor weighs against termination.\n (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would\n be detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n The Court has found by clear and convincing evidence that each of [Father],\n [Mother], and [Aaron P.] committed severe child abuse against Kenna. The\n undisputed evidence supports this finding. Respondents did not deny the\n abuse; they did not accept responsibility for their conduct. They did not\n address how things have changed. They did not address the trauma suffered\n by Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs heavily in favor of\n terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n This Court acknowledges, and truly believes, that not all parental\n misconduct is irredeemable. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 877 (Tenn.\n App. 2005). But knowing full well what is at stake, Respondents declined to\n dispute the overwhelming evidence that they severely abused a child;\n declined to accept any responsibility for Kenna\u2019s wasted condition and the\n trauma suffered by Annabelle and Jasmine; and declined to tell the Court\n what steps they have taken to redeem themselves. This Court has no choice\n but to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that the termination of\n Respondents\u2019 parental rights is in the best interest of the children.\n\n(Footnote omitted). Mother and Father timely appealed to this Court.\n -15-\n\f Discussion\n\nWe restate and consolidate Mother\u2019s issues into the following dispositive issues: 1)\nwhether the Juvenile Court erred in finding the ground of severe child abuse against Mother\nand 2) whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of Mother\u2019s parental\nrights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. Father does not challenge the ground for\ntermination found against him but raises an issue as to Liam\u2019s best interest.\n\nAs our Supreme Court has instructed regarding the standard of review in parental\nrights termination cases:\n\nA parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of her child is among the\n oldest of the judicially recognized fundamental liberty interests protected by\n the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.5 Troxel v.\n Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); Stanley\n v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); In re\n Angela E., 303 S.W.3d 240, 250 (Tenn. 2010); In re Adoption of Female\n Child, 896 S.W.2d 546, 547-48 (Tenn. 1995); Hawk v. Hawk, 855 S.W.2d\n 573, 578-79 (Tenn. 1993). But parental rights, although fundamental and\n constitutionally protected, are not absolute. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 250. \u201c\u2018[T]he [S]tate as parens patriae has a special duty to protect minors .\n . . .\u2019 Tennessee law, thus, upholds the [S]tate\u2019s authority as parens patriae\n when interference with parenting is necessary to prevent serious harm to a\n child.\u201d Hawk, 855 S.W.2d at 580 (quoting In re Hamilton, 657 S.W.2d 425,\n 429 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983)); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747,\n 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 250.\n \u201cWhen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks\n not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388. \u201cFew consequences of judicial\n action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u201d Id. at 787, 102\n S.Ct. 1388; see also M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136\n L.Ed.2d 473 (1996). The parental rights at stake are \u201cfar more precious than\n any property right.\u201d Santosky, 455 U.S. at 758-59, 102 S.Ct. 1388.\n Termination of parental rights has the legal effect of reducing the parent to\n the role of a complete stranger and of \u201csevering forever all legal rights and\n U.S. Const. amend. XIV \u00a7 1 (\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without\ndue process of law . . . .\u201d). Similarly, article 1, section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution states \u201c[t]hat no\nman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled,\nor in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers or\nthe law of the land.\u201d\n -16-\n\f obligations of the parent or guardian of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-\n 113(l)(1); see also Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388 (recognizing\n that a decision terminating parental rights is \u201cfinal and irrevocable\u201d). In light\n of the interests and consequences at stake, parents are constitutionally\n entitled to \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d in termination proceedings.\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 754, 102 S.Ct. 1388; see also Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc.\n Servs. of Durham Cnty., N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d\n 640 (1981) (discussing the due process right of parents to fundamentally fair\n procedures).\n\nAmong the constitutionally mandated \u201cfundamentally fair\n procedures\u201d is a heightened standard of proof \u2013 clear and convincing\n evidence. Santosky, 455 U.S. at 769, 102 S.Ct. 1388. This standard\n minimizes the risk of unnecessary or erroneous governmental interference\n with fundamental parental rights. Id.; In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d 586, 596\n (Tenn. 2010). \u201cClear and convincing evidence enables the fact-finder to\n form a firm belief or conviction regarding the truth of the facts, and\n eliminates any serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of these\n factual findings.\u201d In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596 (citations omitted).\n The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard ensures that the facts are\n established as highly probable, rather than as simply more probable than not.\n In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 861 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); In re M.A.R.,\n 183 S.W.3d 652, 660 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).\n\nTennessee statutes governing parental termination proceedings\n incorporate this constitutionally mandated standard of proof. Tennessee\n Code Annotated section 36-1-113(c) provides:\n\nTermination of parental or guardianship rights must be based\n upon:\n\n(1) A finding by the court by clear and convincing evidence that\n the grounds for termination of parental or guardianship rights\n have been established; and\n (2) That termination of the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s rights is in the\n best interests of the child.\n\nThis statute requires the State to establish by clear and convincing proof that\n at least one of the enumerated statutory grounds6 for termination exists and\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(1)-(13).\n -17-\n\f that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d\n at 250; In re F.R.R., III, 193 S.W.3d 528, 530 (Tenn. 2006); In re Valentine,\n 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). \u201cThe best interests analysis is separate\n from and subsequent to the determination that there is clear and convincing\n evidence of grounds for termination.\u201d In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 254.\n Although several factors relevant to the best interests analysis are statutorily\n enumerated,7 the list is illustrative, not exclusive. The parties are free to offer\n proof of other relevant factors. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 878. The trial\n court must then determine whether the combined weight of the facts\n \u201camount[s] to clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the child\u2019s\n best interest.\u201d In re Kaliyah S., 455 S.W.3d 533, 555 (Tenn. 2015). These\n requirements ensure that each parent receives the constitutionally required\n \u201cindividualized determination that a parent is either unfit or will cause\n substantial harm to his or her child before the fundamental right to the care\n and custody of the child can be taken away.\u201d In re Swanson, 2 S.W.3d 180,\n 188 (Tenn. 1999).\n\nFurthermore, other statutes impose certain requirements upon trial\n courts hearing termination petitions. A trial court must \u201censure that the\n hearing on the petition takes place within six (6) months of the date that the\n petition is filed, unless the court determines an extension is in the best\n interests of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(k). A trial court must\n \u201center an order that makes specific findings of fact and conclusions of law\n within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d Id. This portion of\n the statute requires a trial court to make \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of\n law as to whether clear and convincing evidence establishes the existence of\n each of the grounds asserted for terminating [parental] rights.\u201d In re Angela\n E., 303 S.W.3d at 255. \u201cShould the trial court conclude that clear and\n convincing evidence of ground(s) for termination does exist, then the trial\n court must also make a written finding whether clear and convincing\n evidence establishes that termination of [parental] rights is in the [child\u2019s]\n best interests.\u201d Id. If the trial court\u2019s best interests analysis \u201cis based on\n additional factual findings besides the ones made in conjunction with the\n grounds for termination, the trial court must also include these findings in the\n written order.\u201d Id. Appellate courts \u201cmay not conduct de novo review of the\n termination decision in the absence of such findings.\u201d Id. (citing Adoption\n Place, Inc. v. Doe, 273 S.W.3d 142, 151 & n. 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)).\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i).\n -18-\n\f B. Standards of Appellate Review\n\nAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in\n termination proceedings using the standard of review in Tenn. R. App. P.\n 13(d). In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 246. Under Rule 13(d), appellate courts review factual findings de novo on\n the record and accord these findings a presumption of correctness unless the\n evidence preponderates otherwise. In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In\n re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d 387, 393 (Tenn. 2009); In re Adoption of A.M.H., 215\n S.W.3d 793, 809 (Tenn. 2007). In light of the heightened burden of proof in\n termination proceedings, however, the reviewing court must make its own\n determination as to whether the facts, either as found by the trial court or as\n supported by a preponderance of the evidence, amount to clear and\n convincing evidence of the elements necessary to terminate parental rights.\n In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596-97. The trial court\u2019s ruling that the\n evidence sufficiently supports termination of parental rights is a conclusion\n of law, which appellate courts review de novo with no presumption of\n correctness. In re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d at 393 (quoting In re Adoption of\n A.M.H., 215 S.W.3d at 810). Additionally, all other questions of law in\n parental termination appeals, as in other appeals, are reviewed de novo with\n no presumption of correctness. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 246.\n\nIn re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507, 521-24 (Tenn. 2016) (footnotes in original but\nrenumbered). In conjunction with a best interest determination, clear and convincing\nevidence supporting any single ground will justify a termination order. E.g., In re\nValentine, 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). Although Father does not challenge the\nground for termination found against him, we must review it anyway. In re Carrington H.,\n483 S.W.3d at 511 (\u201c[A]ppellate courts must review a trial court\u2019s findings regarding all\ngrounds for termination and whether termination is in a child\u2019s best interests, even if a\nparent fails to challenge these findings on appeal.\u201d).\n\nWe first address Mother\u2019s issues, beginning with whether the Juvenile Court erred\nin finding the ground of severe child abuse against her. On May 25, 2022, when DCS filed\nits petition, the ground of severe child abuse read as follows:\n\n(g) Initiation of termination of parental or guardianship rights may be based\n upon any of the grounds listed in this subsection (g). The following grounds\n are cumulative and nonexclusive, so that listing conditions, acts or omissions\n in one ground does not prevent them from coming within another ground:\n\n***\n -19-\n\f (4) The parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child\n abuse, as defined in \u00a7 37-1-102, under any prior order of a court or is found\n by the court hearing the petition to terminate parental rights or the petition\n for adoption to have committed severe child abuse against any child[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nAs relevant, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102 provides:\n\n(27) \u201cSevere child abuse\u201d means:\n (A)(i) The knowing exposure of a child to or the knowing failure to protect\n a child from abuse or neglect that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or\n death and the knowing use of force on a child that is likely to cause serious\n bodily injury or death;\n (ii) \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d shall have the same meaning given in \u00a7 39-15-\n 402(c)[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102(b)(27)(A) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022). Regarding\nwhat \u201cknowing\u201d conduct consists of in the context of severe child abuse, our Supreme\nCourt has held:\n\n[F]or severe child abuse, a person\u2019s conduct is considered \u201cknowing,\u201d and a\n person is deemed to \u201cknowingly\u201d act or fail to act, when he actually knows\n of relevant facts, circumstances or information, or when he is either in\n deliberate ignorance of or in reckless disregard of such facts, circumstances,\n or information presented to him. Under this standard, the relevant facts,\n circumstances, or information would alert a reasonable parent to take\n affirmative action to protect the child. For deliberate ignorance, a parent can\n be found to have acted knowingly when he has specific reason to know the\n relevant facts, circumstances, or information but deliberately ignores them.\n For reckless disregard, if the parent has been presented with the relevant\n facts, circumstances, or information and recklessly disregards them, the\n parent\u2019s failure to protect can be considered knowing.\n\nIn re Markus E., 671 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Tenn. 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402 provides, as relevant:\n\n(c) \u201cSerious bodily injury to the child\u201d includes, but is not limited to, second-\n or third-degree burns, a fracture of any bone, a concussion, subdural or\n -20-\n\f subarachnoid bleeding, retinal hemorrhage, cerebral edema, brain contusion,\n injuries to the skin that involve severe bruising or the likelihood of permanent\n or protracted disfigurement, including those sustained by whipping children\n with objects and acts of female genital mutilation as defined in \u00a7 39-13-110.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402(c) (West eff. July 1, 2019).\n\nMother challenges the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings that she committed severe child\nabuse. She asserts that, while the Juvenile Court focused on Kenna\u2019s risk for \u201crefeeding\nsyndrome,\u201d refeeding syndrome was not an abusive act by Mother but simply a result of\nincreasing caloric intake to a malnourished person. Mother argues further that there was\nno basis for the Juvenile Court\u2019s finding that Mother\u2019s striking Kenna with her fists or a\nbroom were likely to cause a broken nose or a concussion.\n\nThe Juvenile Court made detailed factual findings regarding Mother\u2019s abusive acts\ntoward Kenna. The evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s factual\nfindings. Furthermore, the Juvenile Court credited Kenna\u2019s testimony, including her\naccount of suffering at Mother\u2019s hands. We defer to a trial court\u2019s credibility determination\nabsent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Kelly v. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 692\n(Tenn. 2014). This record contains no clear and convincing evidence that would serve to\noverturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s credibility determinations regarding Kenna or any of the\nother witnesses.\n\nThe record reveals that Mother brutally abused Kenna by starving and beating her.\nMother\u2019s emphasis on refeeding syndrome misses the forest for the trees. Had Mother not\nstarved Kenna in the first place, Kenna would not have been at risk for refeeding syndrome.\nMother\u2019s abusive acts led to Kenna becoming gravely malnourished. This Court has\npreviously recognized malnourishment as a basis for sustaining the ground of severe child\nabuse. See In re Keara J., 376 S.W.3d 86, 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2012) (\u201c[W]e conclude that\nthe evidence overwhelmingly establishes Keara as a severely abused child who was\nsuffering the effects of knowing nutritional and physical neglect in her parents\u2019 care.\u201d).\nHere, Mother purposefully deprived Kenna of sufficient food, leading to Kenna becoming\nseverely emaciated. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s condition was such that she faced likely\nstarvation or death, had it continued. Had it not been for the intervention of law\nenforcement, Kenna might well have died of starvation thanks to Mother. Mother\u2019s\nstarvation of Kenna constituted severe child abuse under any definition of the term.\n\nMother also takes issue with the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings regarding her beatings of\nKenna. The Juvenile Court found that, while Kenna had not suffered any broken bones or\na concussion, \u201cbeing struck in the head by [Mother] with her fists and a broom was likely\nto cause a broken nose or concussion.\u201d Mother contends that this finding has no basis. We\n -21-\n\fdisagree. The Juvenile Court\u2019s findings reflect the common sense understanding that an\nadult repeatedly striking a child in the face with fists and/or various hard objects is likely\nto cause that child to have a broken nose or concussion. Mother\u2019s actions toward Kenna\nwent far beyond any legitimate discipline and fell squarely into the statutory definition of\nacts likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n\nAs a final point on this issue, Mother argues strenuously that since Kenna was not\nher child, she should not be held to the duties of a parent or guardian. Mother\u2019s argument\nis without merit. The ground for parental rights at issue, (g)(4), provides for termination\nwhen \u201c[t]he parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child abuse . . .\nagainst any child[.]\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30,\n2022) (emphasis added). Thus, it does not matter that Kenna was not Mother\u2019s child. The\nGeneral Assembly has decided that inflicting severe abuse on any child, not only one\u2019s\nbiological or legal child, will sustain the ground of severe child abuse. We find, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that the ground of severe child abuse was proven against Mother by clear\nand convincing evidence.\n\nWe next address whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. On May 25, 2022, when DCS\nfiled its petition, the best interest factors read as follows:\n\n(i)(1) In determining whether termination of parental or guardianship rights\n is in the best interest of the child, the court shall consider all relevant and\n child-centered factors applicable to the particular case before the court.\n Those factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n (A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the child\u2019s critical\n need for stability and continuity of placement throughout the child\u2019s\n minority;\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to\n have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical condition;\n (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability in meeting\n the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety needs;\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy parental\n attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable expectation that the\n parent can create such attachment;\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with\n the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate a positive\n relationship with the child;\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home;\n\n-22-\n\f(G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s household\ntrigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or post-traumatic\nsymptoms;\n(H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson or persons in the absence of the parent;\n(I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships with persons\nother than parents and caregivers, including biological or foster siblings, and\nthe likely impact of various available outcomes on these relationships and\nthe child\u2019s access to information about the child\u2019s heritage;\n(J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and beneficial for the\nchild to be in the home of the parent, including consideration of whether there\nis criminal activity in the home or by the parent, or the use of alcohol,\ncontrolled substances, or controlled substance analogues which may render\nthe parent unable to consistently care for the child in a safe and stable\nmanner;\n(K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available programs, services,\nor community resources to assist in making a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions;\n(L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent\nin making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in the custody of\nthe department;\n(M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in establishing\npaternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or addressing the\ncircumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award of custody unsafe\nand not in the child\u2019s best interest;\n(N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or frequenting the\nhome of the parent, has shown brutality or physical, sexual, emotional, or\npsychological abuse or neglect toward the child or any other child or adult;\n(O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for the child\nor any other child;\n(P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the basic and\nspecific needs required for the child to thrive;\n(Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and commitment to\ncreating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s basic and specific\nneeds and in which the child can thrive;\n(R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is healthy and\nsafe for the child;\n(S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token financial\nsupport for the child; and\n\n-23-\n\f (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would be\n detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n (2) When considering the factors set forth in subdivision (i)(1), the prompt\n and permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is presumed to\n be in the child\u2019s best interest.\n (3) All factors considered by the court to be applicable to a particular case\n must be identified and supported by specific findings of fact in the court\u2019s\n written order.\n (4) Expert testimony is not required to prove or disprove any factor by any\n party.\n (5) As used in this subsection (i), \u201cparent\u201d includes guardian.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nMother argues that the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest analysis. According\nto Mother, she \u201chas not had a meaningful opportunity to meet the needs of her children in\nmore than two and a half years\u201d because DCS took the Children from her. Mother says it\nwas wrong for the Juvenile Court to hold this separation against her because it presumes\nthat she did what she was accused of doing. Mother also points out that, despite Kenna\u2019s\ncondition, the Children appeared to have been properly fed and were not bruised. In\nessence, Mother argues that, regardless of what she may have done to Kenna, the Children\nwere fine in her care. Mother also says that the Juvenile Court wrongly held her decision\nnot to testify against her.\n\nImplicit to Mother\u2019s argument is that she merely is alleged to have abused Kenna.\nHowever, a bench trial has been held in this matter. The Juvenile Court found that Mother\ncommitted severe child abuse against Kenna based upon its findings that Mother starved\nand beat Kenna. We have found nothing in the record to overturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s\nfactual findings. On the contrary, the record fully supports the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings.\nMother\u2019s abuse of Kenna no longer is a mere allegation\u2014it is an adjudicated fact. It was\nMother\u2019s abusive actions that led to the Children\u2019s removal and her separation from them.\nMother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take responsibility for it, is the\nweightiest factor in this matter. Regarding Mother\u2019s argument that the Children appeared\nnormal despite Kenna\u2019s condition, that is both insufficient and misleading. The Children\nwere in the same household where Mother\u2019s brutality and violence against Kenna unfolded.\nAnnabelle and Jasmine required therapy and fell behind educationally. While the Children\nmay not have been subjected to the same horrors that Mother inflicted on Kenna, they were\nnevertheless exposed to a climate of abuse and fear. Thus, it is inaccurate to suggest that\nthe Children somehow led normal lives notwithstanding what Mother did to Kenna. It was\nappropriate for the Juvenile Court to consider Mother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna in\n -24-\n\fconcluding that the Children were at risk of facing similar abuse should they be returned\nto Mother\u2019s care. There is no hint that Mother understands the severity of what she did to\nKenna or even that what she did to Kenna was wrong. Finally, regarding Mother\u2019s\nassertion that the Juvenile Court held her refusal to testify against her, we find that not to\nbe the case. The Juvenile Court did not punish Mother for declining to testify. It merely\nnoted that Mother could have shed more light on certain factors had she chosen to testify.\nThat was a correct observation by the Juvenile Court. Mother chose not to testify, and the\nJuvenile Court was by necessity limited to the evidence adduced from other sources. In\nsum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as to each applicable best interest factor.\nThe evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We\nfind by clear and convincing evidence, as did the Juvenile Court, that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. We affirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s\njudgment terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights to the Children.\n\nWe next address Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. Father does not contest the ground\nof severe child abuse found against him. All the same, under our Supreme Court\u2019s holding\nin In re Carrington H., we are required to address it. The Juvenile Court made detailed\nfindings regarding Father\u2019s role in the severe abuse suffered by Kenna. Father stood by\nwhile his daughter was starved and suffered beatings at Mother\u2019s hands. Father even\npointed a gun at Kenna on occasion. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground of\nsevere child abuse was proven against Father by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThe final issue we address is whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that\ntermination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. On this issue, Father\nmakes several contentions as to why he believes the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest\nanalysis. Father states that he has appropriate housing; that he is employed; that he\ncompleted a parenting assessment; that he completed an alcohol and drug program; that his\nvisits with Liam were appropriate; that he has completed the tasks required of him; and\nthat Liam liked seeing him on visits. According to Father, the Juvenile Court did not give\nenough weight to these positives in its analysis.\n\nFather is correct in that he did certain positive things during the custodial period.\nThe Juvenile Court recognized as much in its order. For example, the Juvenile Court found\nthat the factor concerning visitation weighed against terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to\nLiam. The record reflects that Liam was happy to see Father on visits. By the same\nmeasure, however, the record reflects that Liam is happy in general. In any event, the\nJuvenile Court did not utterly discount Father\u2019s positive acts. Even still, hinging upon \u201cthe\ncircumstances of a particular child and a particular parent, the consideration of one factor\nmay very well dictate the outcome of the analysis.\u201d In re Gabriella D., 531 S.W.3d 662,\n682 (Tenn. 2017) (quoting In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 878 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).\n -25-\n\fUnder the circumstances of this case, severe child abuse is the paramount concern. Father\nstood by while his daughter Kenna was starved and beaten by Mother. Father even\ncontributed to the abuse by pointing a gun at Kenna on occasion. There is no hint that\nFather has ever taken responsibility for the brutality Kenna endured. Instead, Father\nblamed Kenna. Father\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take\nresponsibility for it, outweighs his positive actions and poses the real risk that Liam could\nsuffer similar abuse in Father\u2019s care. In sum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as\nto each applicable best interest factor. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find by clear and convincing evidence, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that termination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. We\naffirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe judgment of the Juvenile Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the\nJuvenile Court for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed 50% to\nthe Appellant, Rikiya P., and 50% to the Appellant, Daniel R., and their surety, if any.\n\n____________________________________\n D.

Opinion by Gould,\nJ.\n\nDIVORCE \u2013 PROPERTY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Supreme Court of Maryland recognized that in divorce proceedings, a court analyzing\nwhether a property settlement agreement exists utilizes the same principles that it uses for\nother contracts. Mutual assent is a prerequisite for a finding that such an agreement exists.\n\nDIVORCE \u2013 PROPERTY SETTLEMENT \u2013 OFFER\n\nThe Supreme Court of Maryland determined that an offer must be interpreted based upon\na reasonable person standard.\n\nDIVORCE \u2013 PROPERTY SETTLEMENT \u2013 OFFER \u2013 CONDITIONS FOR\nACCEPTANCE\n\nThe Supreme Court of Maryland held that a condition attendant to an offer does not need\nto be communicated within the four corners of the agreement.\n\nDIVORCE \u2013 CONTRACTS \u2013 WITHDRAWAL OF AN OFFER\n\nThe Supreme Court of Maryland determined that an offer can generally be withdrawn by\nthe offeror and that withdrawal can be communicated in writing. If the offeree attempts to\naccept the offer after it has been withdrawn or has expired, the offer becomes a\ncounteroffer, putting the power of acceptance in the hands of the original offeror.\n\nDIVORCE \u2013 CONTRACTS \u2013 ACCEPTANCE\n\nThe Supreme Court of Maryland held that unless the parties so specify or indicate by prior\nperformance, silence does not constitute acceptance of an offer.\n\nDIVORCE \u2013 CONTRACTS \u2013 ACCEPTANCE\n\nThe Supreme Court of Maryland held that there is no duty to respond to a counteroffer.\n\fCircuit Court for Anne Arundel County\nCase No.: C-02-FM-19-001962\nArgued: April 7, 2025\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT\n\nOF MARYLAND\n\nNo. 33\n\nSeptember Term, 2024\n\n______________________________________\n\nTODD A.

The circuit court found that it was timely accepted and that a\n\nbinding settlement agreement was formed. Over the wife\u2019s objection, the court entered a\n\njudgment for absolute divorce based on mutual consent. The court incorporated (but did\n\nnot merge) the settlement agreement into the judgment. The Appellate Court of Maryland\n\ndisagreed and reversed the judgment of the circuit court. We affirm the judgment of the\n\nAppellate Court.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nThis contested divorce case was commenced by Petitioner Todd Pattison\n\n(\u201cHusband\u201d) on May 24, 2019, when he filed a complaint for an absolute divorce against\n\nRespondent Deborah Pattison (\u201cWife\u201d), who filed a counterclaim the following month. The\n\nparties alleged various grounds for divorce, none of which are relevant here.\n\nTrial was scheduled to begin on October 5, 2020. On September 16, 2020, over\n\nWife\u2019s objection, the court postponed the trial until March 2021. Two days later, the parties\n\nattended a pretrial/settlement conference at which they spent approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a retired judge. No settlement was reached.\n\nOn Friday, September 25, 2020, Wife\u2019s counsel sent a hand-delivered settlement\n\npackage to Husband\u2019s counsel containing a Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement\n\nAgreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), bearing Wife\u2019s signature. Among other terms, the\n\nAgreement provided that, \u201c[i]n order to balance the equities of the parties in and to their\n\nproperties, Husband shall pay to Wife a monetary award . . . in the amount of $760,000.00\n\fto be paid\u201d in six installments over two and one-half years. To secure this obligation, the\n\nAgreement required Husband to execute a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d), attached as\n\nExhibit A to the Agreement. The Agreement also stated that Husband\u2019s business and living\n\ntrust \u201cshall guarantee payment of this monetary award obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an\n\nunconditional guaranty (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d) was included in the settlement package.\n\nThe cover letter with the proposed Agreement stated:\n\nEnclosed please find two (2) signed, initialed and notarized originals\n of the Pattison Marital Settlement Agreement for counter-execution by your\n client. A redlined copy of the pages of the Agreement depicting my revisions\n to the version which you sent to me yesterday is also attached; note that non-\n substantive changes were also made at pages 5, 6 and 8 in addition to the\n \u201crepairs\u201d language on pages 3-4. Further note that changes to page 8 were\n made in order to reflect the fact that there is a Note to be paid according to\n its terms and that the Guarantors will not be signing the Note itself.\n\nAlso enclosed is the final version of the Promissory Note (Ex. A) and\n the form of the Guaranty which has been approved by [Wife].\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nHusband received the settlement package by email that same day, but signed the\n\ndocuments the following Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, Husband filed an amended complaint seeking an absolute\n\ndivorce based on mutual consent. See MD. CODE ANN., FAM. LAW (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 7-103(a)(3)\n\n(2019 Repl. Vol.). Among other things, Husband alleged that he and Wife entered into the\n\fAgreement. He requested that the court incorporate but not merge the Agreement into a\n\njudgment of absolute divorce.\n\nWife timely answered the amended complaint on October 12, 2020, alleging that\n\nHusband failed to timely accept her settlement offer and that, therefore, the Agreement was\n\na nullity.\n\nHusband moved to enforce the settlement agreement on October 16, 2020. The court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on March 16, 2021. Husband and Wife both testified. The\n\ncircuit court granted Husband\u2019s motion. The court recognized that settlement agreements\n\nare contracts, and that mutual assent is an \u201cessential prerequisite to the creation or\n\nformation of a contract.\u201d The court then analyzed the language of the Agreement and\n\nconcluded that its plain terms were definite and reflected the parties\u2019 intent to be bound.\n\nThe court rejected Wife\u2019s argument that her offer was conditioned on Husband\n\nsigning the Agreement on September 25, 2020. The court acknowledged that the cover\n\nletter contained language \u201cindicating\u201d a condition that Husband needed to sign the\n\nAgreement on September 25, 2020, but that Husband \u201cdenie[d]\u201d that the letter imposed a\n\n\u201chard deadline, and point[ed] to language\u201d in the letter \u201cindicating an expectation that the\n\nagreement would be finalized by the following week.\u201d The court weighed the credibility\n\nof the witnesses and concluded that Wife\u2019s offer did not include \u201ca definite time expiration\n\nof September 25th, 2020.\u201d The court stated that even if it did, \u201ccontract formation still\n\nwould have occurred through the action of the parties.\u201d The court did not explain the factual\n\nbasis for that finding, but instead proceeded to find that even if Wife had imposed a hard\n\ndeadline, she waived it.\n\f To that end, the court stated that \u201cthe evidence presented at the hearing indicated\n\nthat counsel was in communication throughout the day and the parties were being updated\n\nby their respective counsel.\u201d The court reasoned:\n\nAt some point on the 25th [Husband] indicated through counsel that\n he would not be able to sign the agreement until Monday.\n There is no evidence presented to indicate that [Wife] rejected\n [Husband]\u2019s offer to sign the agreement on Monday, the 28th, rather than\n Friday. In fact, the evidence indicates a willingness to accept the separation\n [agreement] from [Husband] on Monday.\n As a result, [Husband] signed and returned the separation agreement\n on September 28th, 2020.\n Importantly, the first time the issue of untimeliness was raised by\n [Wife] was when she filed her answer to the amended complaint 17 days\n later. [Wife]\u2019s failure to raise the issue until 17 days after [Husband] accepted\n her offer constitutes a waiver of the requirement to sign the separation\n agreement on the 25th.\n\nCiting section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, 1 the court stated:\n\nan offeror who has imposed a time limit in its offer does not in fact insist\n upon it, and by further negotiations the offeror may indicate a continued\n willingness to stand by the terms of its offer. Any such manifestation of\n continued willingness on the part of the offeror will extend the time during\n which acceptance may occur, constituting in effect a new offer which may\n be accepted, and if so accepted, will ripen into a contract.\n\nSee 1 Samuel Williston & Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 5:5 (4th\n\ned.).\n\nFrom there, the court determined that it was \u201cnot persuaded that [Wife] was\n\nunwilling to extend the time during which acceptance [could] occur after learning that\n The circuit court cited to section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, \u201cLapse by\nexpiration of time stated in offer.\u201d In the May 2025 updated version of Williston on\nContracts, that passage is found in section 5:7.\n\f[Husband] was unable to perform\u201d on September 25. Thus, the court found \u201cthat mutual\n\nconsent of the parties to form a contract, namely the [Agreement], ha[d] occurred.\u201d\n\nB\n\nWife noted an appeal. The Appellate Court of Maryland dismissed her appeal\n\nbecause no final judgment had been entered. Pattison v. Pattison, 254 Md. App. 294\n\n(2022).\n\nOn remand, the court granted Husband an absolute divorce by mutual consent and\n\nincorporated but did not merge the Agreement into the divorce decree.\n\nWife appealed again, and in a reported opinion, the Appellate Court reversed.\n\nPattison v. Pattison, 262 Md. App. 504 (2024). The court found that no contract was\n\nformed because Husband failed to execute the Agreement by the end of the day on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, as required by Wife\u2019s explicitly stated condition. Id. at 529, 534-35.\n\nThe court also found no evidence supporting the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Wife had\n\nwaived this condition. Id. at 534.\n\nWe granted Husband\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. Pattison v. Pattison, 489 Md.\n\n243 (2024).\n\nII\n\nA\n\nHusband contends that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement because Wife signed the document on September 25, 2020, and he signed it on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020. He argues that Wife accepted the terms of the Agreement through her\n\nsignature, and that her condition for same-day execution was not part of the Agreement but\n\fwas rather an extrinsic attempt to change its terms. To that end, Husband argues that the\n\nintegration clause in the Agreement\u2014which states that the document contains the entire\n\nunderstanding of the parties\u2014precludes consideration of the condition in the cover letter.\n\nTo support his position, Husband points to his testimony at the hearing that he did\n\nnot interpret the cover letter as imposing a hard deadline of September 25. Husband\n\ntestified: \u201cMy interpretation was [Wife\u2019s counsel] needed all the executed documents by\n\nMonday, because without the personal guarant[y] and the promissory note the settlement\n\nagreement is unenforceable.\u201d\n\nHusband argues that even if the cover letter imposed an acceptance deadline, it was\n\nan unreasonable condition. According to Husband, that\u2019s because the parties\u2019 attorneys\n\ncommunicated on the morning of September 25, and Wife\u2019s counsel knew that nobody\n\nwould be at Husband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office to accept delivery of the settlement package. He\n\nargues that the email with the settlement package was not received by his counsel until\n\n3:51 p.m., \u201cjust over an hour from the close of the business day.\u201d Husband contends that\n\nhe did not receive the original package until September 28. Relying on Canaras v. Lift\n\nTruck Services, Inc., 272 Md. 337 (1974), Husband argues that \u201c[w]hether a provision in a\n\ncontract is a condition the nonfulfillment of which excuses performance depends upon the\n\nintent of the parties to be ascertained from a fair and reasonable construction of the\n\nlanguage used in light of all the surrounding circumstance[s] when they executed the\n\ncontract.\u201d\n\nHusband also relies on section 41 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts for the\n\nproposition that whether an offer is accepted within a reasonable amount of time \u201cis a\n\fquestion of fact[,] depending on all the circumstances existing when the offer and attempted\n\nacceptance are made.\u201d And he argues that he \u201cacted as quickly and as reasonably under\n\nthe facts and circumstances of this case as he could\u201d to fully execute the settlement\n\ndocuments.\n\nFinally, Husband contends that even if Wife imposed a September 25 deadline for\n\nacceptance, she waived it. According to Husband, Wife never communicated her rejection\n\nof the Agreement until she responded to his motion to enforce the Agreement. And, he\n\nmaintains, the circuit court determined that Wife knew Husband could not sign the\n\ndocuments until Monday and that Husband\u2019s counsel was not in his office to accept their\n\ndelivery. Thus, he argues, the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in finding that\n\nWife \u201cwaived strict compliance with her attempted condition[.]\u201d\n\nB\n\nProperty settlement agreements are analyzed under the same principles as other\n\ncontracts. Bruce v. Dyer, 309 Md. 421, 439 (1987). 2 Mutual assent is a prerequisite to the\n In a divorce proceeding, one of the benefits of entering into a property settlement\nagreement is that it provides a basis to obtain a divorce on an expedited basis based on\nmutual consent. But to do that, the parties must put their agreement in writing and submit\nit to the court, which in turn must make a finding that the best interests of the parties\u2019 minor\nchildren, if any, are served by the agreement. FL \u00a7 7-103(a)(3). There is no dispute that\nHusband and Wife intended to put in writing any agreement they reached so that they could\nproceed with a divorce on that basis. This is important because the dissent seems to think\nthat because Wife and Husband, through their counsel, negotiated and agreed upon the\nvarious terms of the Agreement in the days and hours leading up to Wife signing the\nAgreement, there was no going back\u2014that those terms were final and binding before either\nparty even signed the Agreement. To the contrary, it is clear from the testimony that neither\nparty intended to be bound until the Agreement was finalized and signed, and neither party\nargued to the contrary in this Court.\n\fformation of a contract, which means that the contract terms are definite and that the parties\n\nintend to be bound by them. Cochran v. Norkunas, 398 Md. 1, 14 (2007). And \u201cthe\n\nacceptance of the other party must correspond with the offer in its entirety.\u201d Peoples Drug\n\nStores v. Fenton Realty Corp., 191 Md. 489, 494 (1948). Here, neither party contends that\n\nthe proposed Agreement\u2019s terms were not certain or definite. And both parties agree that\n\nWife was the offeror. The sole issue is whether there was an offer and acceptance, without\n\nwhich there can be no mutual assent.\n\nAn offer can come with or without conditions. As this Court stated 92 years ago:\n\nSince the offeror was at liberty to make no offer, it was free to determine and\n impose whatever terms it might choose, and among these it might require\n that its offer be accepted within a designated time in a specific manner. If no\n acceptance is made in the manner and within the period fixed by the offer,\n the offer necessarily expires. Williston on Contracts, secs. 53, 61, 76; Van\n Camp Packing Co. v. Smith, 101 Md. 565, 61 A. 284.\n\nAm. Med. Spirits Co. v. Mayor & City Council of Balt., 165 Md. 128, 133 (1933). This\n\ntime-tested rule makes sense: Contracts are voluntary undertakings; thus, it\u2019s not the\n\ncourt\u2019s place to pass judgment on the wisdom, necessity, or fairness of the conditions an\n\nofferor attaches to her offer. Perhaps Wife had her reasons; perhaps not. Legally, it doesn\u2019t\n\nmatter.\n\nNor does it matter what Husband thought the cover letter meant. An offer is\n\ninterpreted based on \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have\n\nthought it meant.\u201d Ray v. Eurice & Bros., Inc., 201 Md. 115, 127 (1952) (quoting 1 Samuel\n\nWilliston & George J. Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 94 (2d ed.)). As\n\nwe explained 73 years ago:\n\f Williston . . . states the rule as follows: \u201cThe only intent of the parties to a\n contract which is essential[] is an intent to say the words and do the acts\n which constitute their manifestation[s] of assent.\u201d\n\nId. at 127 (quoting 1 Williston & Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 21). 3\n\nHere, there was no ambiguity in the September 25 signature deadline; thus, its\n\ninterpretation is a matter of law that we review without deference. See Adventist\n\nHealthcare, Inc. v. Behram, 488 Md. 410, 432 (2024) (\u201cThe interpretation of a contract,\n\nincluding the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law\n\nreviewed without deference.\u201d). Whether the letter imposed a hard signature deadline does\n\nnot hinge on the credibility of the parties\u2019 respective testimony. What matters is what the\n\ncover letter said and the legal effect of its words.\n\nThe cover letter stated:\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nAlthough the letter was not admitted into evidence, the contents of the entire first\n\nparagraph above were elicited verbatim and confirmed by both Husband and Wife in their\n\ntestimony. The letter expressly distinguishes between the Agreement and Note, which had\n\nto be signed on September 25, and the Guaranty, which could be signed on September 28.\n\nThus, any reasonable person in the parties\u2019 positions would understand that Wife\u2019s offer\n See footnote 4 for an explanation of the legal effect of the words used to express\nan offer.\n\fwas conditioned on Husband signing the Agreement and Note on September 25.\n\nConversely, no reasonable person would perceive any flexibility in that deadline.\n\nC\n\nThat Wife imposed the condition in the cover letter and not within the four corners\n\nof the Agreement is also irrelevant. \u201cIt is hornbook law that an offer of no specified\n\nduration must be accepted within a time reasonable under the circumstances or the offer\n\nwill lapse and a subsequent attempt to accept will be of no effect.\u201d Barnes v. Euster, 240\n\nMd. 603, 607 (1965). It is equally true that \u201can offer that has been extended, but not yet\n\naccepted, generally can be withdrawn by the offeror.\u201d Hall v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty.\n\nDemocratic Cent. Comm., 431 Md. 108, 131 (2013); see also Lemlich v. Bd. of Trs. of\n\nHarford Cmty. Coll., 282 Md. 495, 502 (1978) (\u201cIt is so basic a contract principle that\n\nminimal supporting authority is needed to authorize the statement that there must exist an\n\noffer by one party and an unconditional acceptance of that precise offer by the other, prior\n\nto withdrawal by the offeror, before a binding agreement is born.\u201d); Coleman v.\n\nApplegarth, 68 Md. 21, 29 (1887).\n\nThe withdrawal of a condition can be communicated in various ways, including\n\nthrough written communication. See Pavel Enters., Inc. v. A.S. Johnson Co., Inc., 342 Md.\n\n143, 163 (1996) (finding that the offer was withdrawn by the offeror by a letter to the\n\nofferee expressing an intent to withdraw); James L. Kernan Co. v. Cook, 162 Md. 137, 143\n\n(1932) (finding that an offer had been revoked via a letter from the offeror). Obviously, no\n\nmatter how the offeror communicates a withdrawal, one thing is certain: a withdrawal\n\nwould never be contained in the proposed contract; that is, an offeror cannot\n\fsimultaneously extend and withdraw an offer. So even if Wife had not imposed any\n\ncondition in her cover letter, and so long as Husband had not already accepted it, she could\n\nhave withdrawn the offer in a separate letter at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, September 26, or\n\nat any other time of her choosing. The only difference here is that Wife communicated the\n\nexpiration of the offer in advance, when she conveyed the offer. Basic logic dictates that if\n\nthe withdrawal of an offer can be (and always is) communicated outside of the proposed\n\ncontract after the offer is made, so too can a deadline for accepting an offer when the offer\n\nis made.\n\nD\n\nWe turn now to Husband\u2019s contention that Wife waived compliance with the\n\nSeptember 25 signature deadline. Waiver is \u201cthe intentional relinquishment of a known\n\nright.\u201d Taylor v. Mandel, 402 Md. 109, 135 (2007). Waiver must be clearly communicated\n\nor implied from the circumstances. See Myers v. Kayhoe, 391 Md. 188, 205 (2006) (stating\n\nthat waiver \u201cmust be clearly established and will not be inferred from equivocal acts or\n\nlanguage\u201d); Canaras, 272 Md. at 360-61 (stating that for waiver to be established through\n\nimplication or mutual understanding, there must be evidence of a party\u2019s conduct\n\ndemonstrating relinquishment of a right).\n\nHusband leans heavily on his contention that the circuit court found that Wife knew\n\nHusband could not sign the documents until Monday and that Wife knew Husband\u2019s\n\ncounsel was not at the office to take delivery of the settlement package. Even if those facts\n\nwere true, it would not matter. An offeror\u2019s freedom to impose any conditions on her offer\n\nis not constrained by the offeree\u2019s ability, or lack thereof, to satisfy those conditions.\n\f Wife\u2019s silence after receiving the documents from Husband on September 28\n\nlikewise did not constitute a waiver. When Husband signed the documents on September\n\n28, Wife\u2019s offer had already expired, see Am. Med. Spirits Co., 165 Md. at 133, and thus,\n\nthere was no offer for Husband to accept. As a matter of law, when Husband delivered the\n\nsigned documents to Wife (through counsel) on September 28, Husband made his own\n\noffer\u2014some would call it a counteroffer\u2014to Wife. That counteroffer put the power of\n\nacceptance in Wife\u2019s hands, as the new offeree. Wife had no duty to respond to Husband\u2019s\n\ncounteroffer, and there is no evidence that she did respond, either in words or in deeds,\n\nuntil she timely filed her answer to Husband\u2019s amended complaint, in which she\n\nunambiguously disputed the validity of the Agreement.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that silence can never amount to an acceptance. Acceptance\n\nthrough silence can occur if: (1) the parties agreed to that effect in advance, (2) there was\n\na prior course of dealings that indicated such an understanding, or (3) the offeree accepts\n\nany benefits of the agreement. See id. But there is no evidence to support any of those\n\nexceptions here. Thus, Wife\u2019s mere silence, without more, was not an acceptance of\n\nHusband\u2019s offer. See Cochran, 398 Md. at 23-24.\n\nE\n\nHusband argues that the circuit court improperly excluded evidence of the parties\u2019\n\ncommunications in the days and hours leading up to the hand delivery of the Agreement to\n\nHusband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office. As he did before the Appellate Court, Husband argues that, at\n\na minimum, we should remand the matter for the circuit court to consider those exhibits.\n\nWe have considered all the exhibits in the record, and we determine that, as a matter of\n\flaw, no contract was formed due to Husband\u2019s failure to adhere to Wife\u2019s deadline, and\n\nthat the evidence, including the excluded exhibits, does not support the circuit court\u2019s\n\nwaiver finding.\n\nThose emails, had they been admitted, would have established the following:\n\n\u2022 September 24 at 9:37 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel responded to Husband\u2019s proposals\n regarding personal property and financial responsibility for home repairs. Wife\u2019s\n counsel closed the email saying: \u201cIf this is acceptable, I will include your\n revisions in the Agreement, add the repair language above, and have [Wife] sign\n the Agreement for your client\u2019s counter-signing.\u201d Thus, Husband was on notice\n to expect the signed documents from Wife that same day.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 8:16 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel emailed to Wife\u2019s counsel a draft\n of the Guaranty with both counsel\u2019s and Husband\u2019s corporate counsel\u2019s\n comments and edits. Husband\u2019s counsel advised that \u201c[Husband\u2019s corporate\n counsel] has not addressed some things still.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:17 a.m.: Referring to the Guaranty, Wife\u2019s counsel asked\n Husband\u2019s counsel: \u201cWhen can we expect [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\u2019s final\n comments? If not done this morning, I suppose this will have to be done next\n week sometime.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:40 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cWe can execute the\n other documents today though. I have no problem with that. The Guaranty is\n agreed.\u201d Thus, it was Husband\u2019s counsel, not Wife\u2019s counsel, who planted the\n idea that Husband would sign the Agreement and Note, but not the Guaranty,\n that same day. Husband\u2019s counsel never retracted that suggestion.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:52 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel proposed revised language\n regarding the repairs to the marital home before it could be sold and told\n Husband\u2019s counsel that Husband\u2019s proposed changes to the Guaranty were\n accepted \u201cexcept for the striking of the attorneys[\u2019] fees provision. My partner\n has included the same 10% attorneys[\u2019] fees provision as is in the Promissory\n Note.\u201d The email closed with: \u201cIf these changes are accepted, we can finish up.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 11:04 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI sent this to [Husband].\u201d\n And referring to the proposed changes to the home repair provisions, Husband\u2019s\n counsel said, \u201cI am fine with it as long as it is clear it is an exception to the\n\f general language that [Husband] is solely responsible for upkeep of the house\n and bills.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 1:59 p.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel attached a revised Guaranty\n reflecting the change to the attorneys\u2019 fees provision mentioned in the prior\n email, and informed Husband\u2019s counsel that: \u201cthe signed and notarized\n Agreement, the Note and Guaranty will be delivered to your office in the next\n half hour. The [cover] letter is attached to this e-mail as well.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s\n counsel was informed about the signature deadline in the early afternoon of\n September 25. And Husband testified that he saw that email and was aware that\n the signed Agreement and Note would be delivered to his counsel\u2019s office.\n Husband testified that he received the cover letter attached to that email.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:31 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\n is there.\u201d This was when Wife\u2019s counsel first learned that Husband\u2019s counsel\n was not in his office.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:39 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel told Wife\u2019s counsel that he asked\n Husband\u2019s corporate counsel to expedite his review of the Guaranty and stated:\n \u201cIf it needs to be edited at all I will let you know.\u201d Husband\u2019s counsel added:\n \u201cFortunately [Husband] was ok with the principle regarding the house repairs as\n you set forth in your earlier email. I do need to review myself and if I have any\n tweak[s] I will let you know.\u201d Thus, Husband was engaged in the settlement\n process on September 25, notwithstanding his illness.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:27 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel wrote to Wife\u2019s counsel: \u201cI know\n you are out, and am sorry to bother. But could you have someone send me via\n email the version of the Separation Agreement you had her sing [sic] and sent to\n my office please. I am not there at all today.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s counsel\n appreciated the importance of getting the documents to Husband for his\n signature that day, as opposed to waiting for the following Monday.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:57 p.m.: Responding to Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s 1:59 p.m. email,\n Husband\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cThis should be fine. [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\n had no more additions.\u201d Again, no mention of any concern with the signature\n deadline.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:51 p.m.: Someone from Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s office emailed the\n settlement agreement package to Husband\u2019s counsel as requested in the latter\u2019s\n email at 3:27 p.m.\n\f These emails would have provided no support for the circuit court\u2019s finding that\n\nHusband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer or that Wife waived the signature deadline. Thus,\n\nwe agree with the Appellate Court that a remand for that purpose is unnecessary. 4\n\nJUDGMENT OF THE APPELLATE\n COURT OF MARYLAND\n We respectfully disagree with the analysis of our dissenting colleagues. This case\nis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about whether the Agreement constituted a\nbinding contract under basic principles of offer and acceptance. The dissent\u2019s reliance on\nthe terms of the Agreement, including the provisions confirming the voluntariness of the\nparties\u2019 signatures, the effective date of September 25, 2020, the integration clause, and\nothers, are misplaced. For the same reason, so too is the dissent\u2019s reliance on the parol\nevidence rule. Had Husband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer, all the terms of the Agreement\nwould have been binding, and parol evidence would not have been permitted to vary them.\n The dissent contends that we should attribute no significance to the cover letter\nbecause it was excluded as hearsay. But the dissent overlooks that both parties, in their\ntestimony, testified about and confirmed the cover letter\u2019s contents verbatim, and without\nobjection. So even if the substance of the cover letter constituted hearsay, any objection on\nthat basis was waived, as its contents were in evidence and undisputed. Thus, the existence\nof the September 25th deadline for the execution of the Agreement did not hinge on\nanyone\u2019s credibility.\n The dissent\u2019s focus on the hearsay issue underscores a broader misunderstanding of\nthe legal import of the cover letter and the evidentiary purpose it served. \u201c\u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). The\ncontents of the cover letter were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather\nfor the legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter\nwith such contents constituted an act with independent legal significance. See State v.\nYoung, 462 Md. 159, 175 (2018).\n Such acts include the making and acceptance of an offer. Garner v. State, 414 Md.\n372, 382 (2010). For example, if a person were to say to a car owner \u201cI offer you $200 for\nyour car and the offer expires in 15 minutes,\u201d that statement would be admissible for the\nlegal effect of uttering those words, which are twofold: (1) the person offered to buy the\ncar for $200 and put the power of acceptance in the owner\u2019s hands; and (2) the owner\u2019s\npower of acceptance expires in 15 minutes. If the owner wasn\u2019t listening and did not learn\nabout the offer until after it expired (perhaps when the person later said to the owner that\nthe person was surprised that the owner didn\u2019t accept it), as a matter of law, this would not\nmatter. Nor would it matter that the owner never agreed to the unilateral deadline.

In my view, the Majority\u2019s\n\nframing of the case through an \u201coffer and acceptance\u201d construct is misplaced. The parties\n\nhad already negotiated and agreed to all material terms of a settlement, reduced that\n\nagreement to writing, and Respondent (referred to herein as \u201cWife\u201d or \u201cMs. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned, initialed, and notarized the agreement. Her signature reflected her unequivocal\n\nassent to be bound. When Petitioner (referred to herein as \u201cHusband\u201d or \u201cMr. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned the agreement on September 28, 2020, there was no open offer left to accept or\n\nreject \u2013 only a binding agreement to be enforced.\n\nThe Majority cites no case \u2013 and I am aware of none \u2013 in which a court has set aside\n\na fully executed, integrated agreement based solely on a purported condition precedent\n\nfound in an extrinsic document. Yet that is precisely the result the Majority reaches.\n\nAccording to the Majority, \u201cany reasonable person\u201d would have understood Wife\u2019s\n\ndirective that Husband sign the agreement on September 25, 2020, as a binding condition\n\nprecedent to contract formation, and \u201c[c]onversely, no reasonable person would perceive\n\nany flexibility in that deadline.\u201d Majority Op. at 9-10. But that is not what the trial court\n\nfound. There is no evidence that this so-called \u201cdirective\u201d was timely conveyed to Husband\n\nor that he acknowledged it. This \u201cdirective\u201d was not contained in the agreement, but rather\n\nappeared only in a cover letter dated September 25, 2020, authored by Wife\u2019s counsel and\n\nenclosing the agreement (the \u201cCover Letter\u201d). Husband did not testify that he read the\n\nCover Letter before the deadline passed or that he understood it to impose any binding\n\ncondition. Neither party\u2019s counsel testified as to what, if any, communications occurred\n\fregarding a deadline. Most notably, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as\n\nhearsay.\n\nIn effect, the Majority invalidates a fully executed, integrated settlement agreement\n\nbased entirely on an excluded hearsay document \u2013 a remarkably thin evidentiary reed on\n\nwhich to overturn not only a signed contract but also the trial court\u2019s supported factual\n\nfindings. In my view, the trial court got it right. Given the deference owed to a trial court\u2019s\n\nfindings, and in light of Maryland\u2019s strong policy favoring settlements and the efficient\n\nadministration of justice, see Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., 251 Md. 544, 550 (1968),\n\ncert. denied, 394 U.S. 974 (1969), I would affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n\nI.\n\nFacts\n\nI agree with the factual background set forth in the Majority opinion and will only\n\nsummarize additional facts in this opinion as needed.\n\nAfter a hearing on the Petitioner\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement, the trial judge\n\nruled on March 17, 2021, that the parties had reached a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement following extensive negotiations. After spending approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a former judge of the Supreme Court of Maryland and engaging in nearly\n\nthree weeks of back-and-forth negotiation, the parties agreed on all material terms of a\n\nsettlement and reduced that agreement to writing. The agreement, finalized by Wife\u2019s\n\nattorney, was memorialized in a twelve\u2010page \u201cVoluntary Separation and Property\n\nSettlement Agreement\u201d (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d).\n\f The uncontroverted record shows that Wife signed and initialed each page of the\n\nSettlement Agreement and dated it September 25, 2020. Wife had the Settlement\n\nAgreement notarized, certifying that she personally appeared before the notary to\n\n\u201cexecute[] this Agreement and made oath in due form of law that the matters and facts set\n\nforth in the foregoing Agreement true and correct as stated in the Agreement, and [that she]\n\nacknowledged that the Agreement is in fact her free act and deed and that she has full\n\nunderstanding of its terms.\u201d Husband signed and notarized the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms are undisputed: it became effective on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. The Settlement Agreement is fully integrated and prohibits any\n\namendments without mutual written consent. Both parties declared that the terms of the\n\nagreement were \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d and that they signed the agreement \u201cfreely and\n\nvoluntarily.\u201d Based on its analysis of the agreement, the trial court held that the parties\u2019\n\n\u201cintent can be determined from the unambiguous language in the [Settlement Agreement].\u201d\n\nConsequently, the trial court found that the Settlement Agreement was valid and\n\nenforceable as of September 25, 2020, and that there was mutual assent by the parties to\n\nbe bound by its terms.\n\nWife argued that there was no mutual assent to contract because Husband did not\n\ncomply with her demand in the Cover Letter that he sign the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. In that letter, Wife\u2019s counsel wrote, \u201c[t]his Agreement is delivered\n\nto you in settlement of the parties\u2019 outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement\n\nand Note be executed by Mr. Pattison today.\u201d But the Cover Letter was excluded from\n\fevidence as inadmissible hearsay. During the hearing, however, Wife\u2019s counsel read\n\nexcerpts from the Cover Letter to Husband and he was questioned as to whether he was\n\nfamiliar with the letter. The authors and recipients of the hearsay documents did not testify.\n\nHusband testified that he first saw the original copy of the Settlement Agreement\n\nwith Wife\u2019s signature \u201c[o]n the morning of Monday, September 28th, 2020.\u201d Because he\n\nwas quarantined after testing positive for Covid, he made arrangements with his attorney\n\nto have the Settlement Agreement dropped off on the sidewalk outside his home. He then\n\nsigned the Settlement Agreement, had it notarized, and returned it to his counsel. Husband\n\ntestified that he saw an emailed version of the Settlement Agreement at some point after 5\n\np.m. on Friday, September 25. He was not sure if that email version he saw was signed by\n\nMs. Pattison. No exhibit was admitted into evidence that purported to be the emailed\n\nversion of the Settlement Agreement or Cover Letter. The Cover Letter itself does not\n\nindicate that it was emailed to Mr. Pattison or his counsel but indicates that Ms. Pattison\n\nwas copied on the email.\n\nWife testified that she signed the Settlement Agreement \u201caround noon\u201d on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, and instructed her counsel to deliver it \u201cwith condition that the\n\nAgreement and Note be executed by Mr. Pattison that Friday.\u201d Yet she neither directly\n\ncommunicated that condition to Husband nor did Husband testify specifically that he saw\n\nthe Cover Letter on that date. There is no evidence in the record of whether the attorneys\n\ncommunicated with each other about the deadline contained in the Cover Letter. What we\n\ndo know is that the Settlement Agreement contained no such deadline; Wife never\n\fconveyed one directly; and neither attorney was in the office late Friday afternoon,\n\nSeptember 25, to receive the executed documents.\n\nThe trial court ruled that the language of the Settlement Agreement\n\n\u201cunambiguously[] indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into a[n] . . . agreement\n\non September 25th, 2020 to settle all matters[.]\u201d With respect to the alleged condition\n\nprecedent, all that the trial judge had before her were the parties\u2019 competing testimonies \u2013\n\nHusband\u2019s testimony that he never understood September 25, 2020, to be a firm cutoff, and\n\nWife\u2019s recollections of her instructions to her counsel regarding the alleged condition\n\nprecedent. The trial court relied on neither the Cover Letter nor the emails between counsel\n\nthat it excluded from evidence. On that record, the trial court found the alleged deadline\n\nuncommunicated and unenforceable, holding that \u201c[a]fter consideration of the evidence\n\nand considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The trial court further\n\nreasoned that \u201c[e]ven if for argument sake communication that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a time limit, contract formation still would have occurred through the action of\n\nthe parties.\u201d\n\nII.\n\nStandard of Review\n\nWhen an action is tried without a jury, an appellate court reviews both the law and\n\nthe evidence. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The trial court\u2019s factual findings \u2013 including findings\n\nbased on witness credibility, inferences from conduct, and the surrounding context of an\n\nalleged agreement \u2013 are reviewed for clear error. See Torboli v. Torboli, 127 Md. App.\n\f666, 672 (1999). The appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party, City of Bowie v. MIE Props., Inc., 398 Md. 657, 676 (2007) and resolves\n\nall evidentiary conflicts in the prevailing party\u2019s favor. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Steele\n\nSoftware Sys. Corp., 154 Md. App. 97, 107 n.1 (2003), cert. denied, 380 Md. 619 (2004);\n\nsee also Brault Graham, LLC v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., 211 Md. App. 638,\n\n659 (2013) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and\n\nreviews the trial court's legal conclusions de novo.\u201d). If there is any competent and material\n\nevidence to support the court\u2019s findings, those findings cannot be held clearly erroneous.\n\nL.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Md. Nat\u2019l Golf, L.P., 165 Md. App. 339, 343 (2005).\n\nIII.\n\nDiscussion\n\nI disagree with the Majority that Wife imposed a valid condition precedent to the\n\nformation of the Settlement Agreement through the Cover Letter. The parties agreed to\n\nsettle this case effective September 25, 2020, as evidenced by their notarized signatures on\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The terms and conditions of their settlement are reflected in\n\nthat agreement. Nowhere in the Settlement Agreement is there a timing provision on\n\nsigning the agreement or any reference to the Cover Letter. Moreover, the Cover Letter\n\nwas deemed hearsay by the trial court and was not admitted into evidence. At most,\n\nwhether Wife imposed a valid condition precedent presented a disputed factual question \u2013\n\nnamely, whether she clearly and effectively communicated a firm deadline for Husband to\n\nsign the agreement on September 25, 2020. The trial court answered that question in the\n\nnegative and its finding is well supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.\n\f A.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That There Was Mutual Assent\n For the Settlement Agreement Is Entitled to Deference\n\nThe trial court correctly found that the parties reached mutual assent to settle the\n\ncase effective September 25, 2020. After nearly three weeks of back-and-forth\n\nnegotiations and multiple drafts, Wife\u2019s counsel prepared the final agreement, which Wife\n\nsigned in two original copies, initialed on each page, and had notarized. Husband likewise\n\ntestified that he agreed to all the terms and conditions. The trial court found that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was fully integrated and effective under its express terms on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. There was no allegation of duress, fraud, or mistake. 1 Wife signed\n\nof her own volition, fully represented by counsel, and under no compulsion to execute the\n\ndocument. Husband did the same on Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nThe trial court concluded that the Settlement Agreement:\n\n[U]nambiguously, indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into\n a voluntary separation and property agreement on September 25th, 2020 to\n settle all matters of every kind and character arising from their marital\n relationship.\n\nAs a result, this Court finds that the threshold issue of whether mutual\n assent, the essential prerequisite to the creation or formation of a contract,\n has occurred.\n\nI find that the trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion are well-supported by the\n\nevidentiary record in this case.\n Wife alleged duress in her motion to set aside the Settlement Agreement, but did\nnot introduce any evidence of duress at the hearing, and ultimately withdrew the motion.\n\f The trial court further determined that because the parties\u2019 intent to form a contract\n\ncould be gleaned from the unambiguous language contained in the Settlement Agreement,\n\nconsideration of the Cover Letter was not appropriate because it was barred by the parol\n\nevidence rule. I agree with this ruling as well. See Calomiris v. Wood, 353 Md. 425, 361-\n\n62 (1999) (\u201cUnder the parol evidence rule, a written agreement \u2018discharges prior\n\nagreements,\u2019 thereby rendering legally inoperative communications and negotiations\n\nleading up to the written contract.\u201d) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\n\n213 (1979)).\n\nThere is ample competent evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding of a binding\n\ncontract: the fully executed, integrated, and notarized Settlement Agreement itself, Wife\u2019s\n\ndelivery of the signed originals, and Husband\u2019s express acceptance of its terms. The trial\n\ncourt credited this direct evidence in finding mutual assent \u2013 a finding we review only for\n\nclear error. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The Majority ignores the trial court\u2019s finding of mutual\n\nassent and its interpretation of the express terms of the Settlement Agreement. Instead, the\n\nMajority relies on an excluded post hoc hearsay document to conclude that Wife\u2019s\n\npurported \u201coffer\u201d had not been \u201caccepted\u201d and expired at midnight on September 25. As\n\ndiscussed below, I disagree with this approach because it rewrites the factual record,\n\ndisregards the trial court\u2019s firsthand credibility determinations, and relies on excluded\n\nhearsay to reach its conclusion.\n\f B.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Wife Did Not Impose\n A Valid Condition Precedent Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\nHaving determined that the fully executed, integrated Settlement Agreement was\n\nbinding and enforceable as of September 25, 2020, the trial court also evaluated whether\n\nWife\u2019s testimony \u2013 that she conditioned her offer on Husband\u2019s signing by that date \u2013 was\n\nsupported by the evidence. The trial court found that it was not, explaining: \u201cAfter\n\nconsideration of the evidence and considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find\n\nthat Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer included a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d\n\nBecause that factual finding is entitled to deference under Maryland Rule 8-131(c) unless\n\n\u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d see Mercy Medical Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare of the Mid-Atl.,\n\nInc., 149 Md. App. 336, 355 (2003), and because the record amply supports that finding,\n\nthe trial court ruling should be affirmed.\n\nThe reasons offered by the Majority to overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling are\n\nunpersuasive.\n\nFirst, the Cover Letter could not impose a valid condition precedent to formation of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The letter was drafted after Wife had already executed the\n\nSettlement Agreement, contains no reference to any signature deadline, and cannot\n\nretroactively alter a contract already formed as of September 25. A condition precedent by\n\ndefinition must exist at the moment of contract formation; it cannot be grafted on by a\n\nunilateral post-execution communication.\n\f Second, there is no evidence that any deadline was directly conveyed to Mr. Pattison\n\nprior to midnight on September 25, much less that he acknowledged or ratified such a\n\ndeadline. No one \u2013 neither Mr. Pattison, the attorneys, nor Ms. Pattison \u2013 testified that a\n\nSeptember 25, 2020 deadline was expressly conveyed to Mr. Pattison. Mr. Pattison\n\nacknowledged receiving and being familiar with the Cover Letter; but that does not\n\nestablish that he read or understood the letter as of the evening of September 25, or that he\n\nregarded it as imposing a binding deadline.\n\nMr. Pattison was asked directly whether he understood there to be \u201ca condition that\n\nyou sign the agreement and the note on September 25.\u201d He responded: \u201cThat\u2019s not\n\ncorrect.\u201d He elaborated:\n\nBecause the next sentence [of the Cover Letter] says, \u2018I will assume that we\n will have a final guaranty signed by Mr. Pattison by close of business on\n Monday.\u2019 My interpretation was [Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney] needed all the\n executed documents by Monday, because without the personal guaranty and\n the promissory note, the settlement agreement is unenforceable.\n\nMr. Pattison further testified that he understood there to be no deadline or expiration\n\ndate for his signature on the Settlement Agreement. He believed, based on his attorney\u2019s\n\ncommunications with Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney, that the parties had reached agreement on\n\nall terms as of Friday, September 25, 2020, and that he was obligated to sign the personal\n\nguaranty and promissory note in the days that followed. When asked if it was his position\n\nthat he could sign the settlement documents on Monday, September 28, when he provided\n\nthe final guaranty, Mr. Pattison answered: \u201cMy position has always been that.\u201d\n\nI disagree with the Majority opinion that Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was\n\nirrelevant. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was informed, at least\n\fin part, on his understanding that he and Wife had agreed to all outstanding issues effective\n\nSeptember 25 as evidenced by Wife\u2019s execution of the Settlement Agreement. With respect\n\nto the timing of his signature, Mr. Pattison understood that he could execute all of the\n\nsettlement documents on Monday, September 28. The trial court credited that testimony,\n\nand it provided a reasonable basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that there was no clear\n\ncondition precedent tied to the September 25 date.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s citation to Ray v. Eurice & Bros, Inc., 201 Md. 115 (1952) is\n\nmisplaced. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Ray and its progeny stand for the principle that a\n\nparty\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant when interpreting the terms of a contract that both\n\nparties signed. Here, it is undisputed that the Cover Letter was not incorporated into the\n\nSettlement Agreement, was not signed or agreed to by Husband (or perhaps timely seen),\n\nand, importantly, never admitted into evidence. Since the Cover Letter was not part of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Ray does not resolve whether that letter\u2019s terms \u2013 standing alone \u2013\n\ncreate a legally enforceable condition precedent. As the trial court correctly recognized,\n\nthey did not.\n\nThird, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as inadmissible hearsay and its\n\ncontents cannot be considered on appellate review as a basis for overturning the trial court\u2019s\n\nfactual findings. 2 Wife did not challenge that exclusion on appeal, so we should not\n The Majority\u2019s analytical variability on the trial court\u2019s findings below is\nunderscored by its effort to recast the Cover Letter as non-hearsay. See Majority Op. at 15\nn.4. The Majority argues that the Cover Letter was not offered for its truth, but rather \u201cfor\nthe legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter with\nsuch contents constituted an act with independent legal significance.\u201d But that effect\n\freconsider its exclusion now. See Md. Rule 8-131(a); Robinson v. State, 404 Md. 208, 217\n\n(2008). The fact that Wife\u2019s counsel read the contents of the Cover Letter to Husband and\n\nWife during questioning does not transform inadmissible material into admissible\n\nevidence. See cf. Clermont v. State, 348 Md. 419, 429 (1998) (defense counsel\u2019s statement\n\ndid not constitute as evidence and was properly struck from the record). It is manifestly\n\nunfair to strike down a contract based on a document the trial court neither admitted into\n\nevidence nor relied upon in its ruling. The Majority cites no case to the contrary.\n\nFourth, the Majority overlooks the fact that the Cover Letter was both legally and\n\npractically incapable of imposing a same-day deadline. Because the Settlement Agreement\n\ndid not include a counterpart clause, Mr. Pattison was not authorized to simply signed an\n\nemail copy of the agreement as the Majority suggests. Such a clause typically allows\n\ncontracts to be executed in \u201ccounterparts, and each counterpart will have the same force\n\nand effect as an original and will constitute an effective, binding agreement on the part of\n\neach of the undersigneds.\u201d See Alan S. Gutterman, Business Transactions Solutions \u00a7\n\nhinges on the recipient\u2019s timely awareness of \u201cWife\u2019s expression of the deadline\u201d \u2013 a\nfactual dispute the trial court resolved in Husband\u2019s favor. Indeed, the very case the\nMajority cites \u2013 Garner v. State, 414 Md. 372 (2010) \u2013 undermines the notion that it does\nnot matter if the offeree \u201cdid not learn about the offer until after it expired.\u201d Majority Op.\nat 15 n.4. In order to constitute non-hearsay, a \u201cverbal act\u201d must not only have independent\nlegal significance, but also is clearly communicated to the recipient to give it evidentiary\nsignificance. Garner, 414 Md. at 382 (\u201ccan I get a 40\u201d was a verbal act with legal\nsignificance and actually received by the listener). More fundamentally, the time to invoke\nthis argument has long passed. Unlike in Garner, where the hearsay issue was appealed,\nWife did not raise this argument before the trial court. Neither party challenged the\nexclusion of the Cover Letter on appeal, and both structured their proofs at trial\naccordingly. Waiver and failure to preserve preclude this Court from reversing the trial\ncourt\u2019s evidentiary ruling. The Majority cites no authority permitting it to revive and rely\non excluded hearsay at this stage \u2013 and I know of none.\n\f113:130 (Thomson Reuters 2010). These clauses are standard when parties are expected\n\nto sign at different times or locations. Indeed, the Cover Letter acknowledged that Ms.\n\nPattison had already signed both originals and instructed Mr. Pattison to \u201ccounter-execute\u201d\n\nthem \u2013 not sign an email copy. Thus, this instruction contemplated sequential, not\n\nsimultaneous, execution of the Settlement Agreement. 3\n\nSame-day counter-execution of the Settlement Agreement was also impractical. It\n\nis undisputed that Wife\u2019s counsel sent the executed originals late in the day on Friday,\n\nSeptember 25, to a law office he knew would be closed for the weekend. See Majority Op.\n\nat 13-14. Mr. Pattison, who was incapacitated on September 25 as a result of having Covid,\n\ndid not receive the originals until Monday, September 28. How, then, can the Cover Letter\n\nimpose a \u201cdefinite deadline\u201d requiring execution on September 25, when the documents\n\nwere physically inaccessible to Mr. Pattison until three days later? The Majority offers no\n\nanswer \u2013 only speculation that his counsel could have requested an extension. See Majority\n\nOp. at 15.\n\nFifth, the Majority disregards the trial judge\u2019s credibility determinations. After\n\nhearing testimony from both parties, the judge found that Ms. Pattison did not impose \u201ca\n\ndefinite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The Majority declares credibility\n This is further evidence that the Cover Letter was merely a timing provision that\nWife sought to impose after the fact. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, any temporal gap\nbetween the parties\u2019 respective signatures would reduce every mutually assented to\nagreement to a mere \u201coffer\u201d until the other party signed \u2013 an outcome squarely at odds with\nestablished principles of contract law.\n\f\u201cirrelevant\u201d and instead relies on counsel\u2019s scheduling emails \u2013 which were also excluded\n\nas hearsay \u2013 to conclude that Husband \u201cwas engaged in the settlement process on\n\nSeptember 25, notwithstanding his illness.\u201d Majority Op. at 14. Not only is this conclusion\n\ninconsistent with Mr. Pattison\u2019s testimony, 4 but it also ignores the trial court\u2019s role in\n\nresolving factual disputes.\n\nFinally, the Majority gives short shrift to the standard of review. The trial court,\n\nsitting as fact-finder, heard the evidence, evaluated credibility, and concluded that Wife\n\nfailed to prove the existence of a valid condition precedent. That conclusion was rooted in\n\nthe plain language of the Settlement Agreement, which established the effective date of the\n\nSettlement Agreement as of September 25 and which contained no deadline for Husband\u2019s\n\nsignature, and no express condition precedent. Viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to Husband as the prevailing party, and resolving all evidentiary conflicts in his\n\nfavor, we should affirm rather than second-guess the trial court\u2019s factual findings or fill\n\nevidentiary gaps with unwarranted inferences against him. See Knowles v. Binford, 268\n\nMd. 2, 11 (1972) (\u201c[T]he trial court is not only the judge of a witness\u2019 credibility, but is\n\nalso the judge of the weight to attach to the evidence[.]\u201d).\n\nIV.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to consider the context in which this dispute arose. On\n\nMarch 16, 2021, the trial court convened a two-day enforcement hearing on Husband\u2019s\n Mr. Pattison testified that he was ill with Covid on September 25, 2020, and slept\nmost of the day.\n\fmotion to enforce the Settlement Agreement he and Wife had negotiated and agreed to\n\nthrough counsel. In evidence before the court was the fully executed Settlement\n\nAgreement \u2013 signed, initialed, and notarized by both parties. The terms of the agreement\n\nwere clear and unambiguous.\n\nMs. Pattison seeks to transform an after-the-fact cover letter \u2013 excluded from\n\nevidence as hearsay \u2013 into a condition precedent to contract formation. She contends that\n\nthe agreement sent to Mr. Pattison on September 25, 2020, constituted a mere offer, subject\n\nto automatic withdrawal at midnight unless signed that same day. But this ignores that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was effective as of September 25 and there is no indication in the\n\nrecord that any such \u201ccondition\u201d was clearly communicated to Mr. Pattison. Notably,\n\nneither Ms. Pattison nor her attorney advised Mr. Pattison that the \u201coffer\u201d was withdrawn\n\nafter the supposed deadline passed. To the contrary, when Ms. Pattison received the\n\nexecuted agreement from Mr. Pattison on Monday, September 28, she raised no objections.\n\nIt was not until October 14 \u2013 seventeen days later, and two weeks after Mr. Pattison had\n\nbegun performing under the agreement \u2013 that Ms. Pattison first asserted that no contract\n\nhad been formed due to an unmet condition precedent. 5\n I agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that even assuming the Cover Letter imposed\na valid condition precedent, the record demonstrates that Wife waived that condition by\nher actions. Where an offeror \u201cwho does not in fact insist upon\u201d a time limit and continues\nnegotiations \u201cmay indicate a continued willingness to stand by the terms of its offer,\u201d\nthereby extending the acceptance period and effectively creating a new offer. Williston on\nContracts \u00a7 5:5.\n\f In reversing the trial court\u2019s enforcement of the Settlement Agreement, the Majority\n\nhas effectively announced a new rule of contract construction: a fully executed, integrated\n\nsettlement agreement \u2013 signed, notarized, and negotiated by counsel \u2013 may be set aside if\n\none party can point to any contemporaneous, extrinsic communication arguably\n\nconditioning its formation. That departs from Maryland\u2019s objective theory of contracts, as\n\narticulated in Ray, which holds that \u201c[t]he only intent of the parties to a contract which is\n\nessential, is an intent to say the words and do the acts which constitute their manifestation\n\nof assent,\u201d judged by what a reasonable person in the parties\u2019 position would have\n\nunderstood. Ray, 201 Md. at 127. Even if one party is mistaken, and even if that mistake\n\ncreates a hardship, a clearly expressed, integrated written contract may not be varied by\n\nparol evidence \u2013 absent fraud, duress, or mutual mistake. Id. at 125.\n\nHere, there are no allegations of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake \u2013 nor even a claim\n\nthat enforcement of the agreement would create any hardship. Ms. Pattison simply changed\n\nher mind \u2013 nineteen days after signing the Settlement Agreement \u2013 presumably because\n\nshe decided she wanted more money than what the agreement provided. She even later\n\ndescribed the Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms as \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nBy supplanting the objective inquiry (what does the contract say?) with a subjective\n\none (what do the extrinsic, unincorporated communications say?), the Majority undermines\n\nthe certainty that integrated contracts are meant to provide. 6 The Majority\u2019s opinion invites\n The Majority insists that this case \u201cis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about\n. . . offer and acceptance.\u201d Majority Op. at 15 n.4. Respectfully, that framing collapses\nunder the weight of the record. The trial court expressly found that the parties had already\n\flitigation over cover letters, emails, text messages, social media posts and other collateral\n\ndocuments or media a party may never have seen or agreed to \u2013 and renders enforcement\n\nof even signed, notarized, and fully integrated agreements uncertain.\n\nThe Majority opinion is even more problematic in the family law context, where\n\nemotions run high. By imposing strict black letter law as to offer and acceptance \u2013\n\nincorrectly, as it turns out here \u2013 the Majority opinion could significantly hamper the ability\n\nof judges to resolve these cases. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, a party who develops\n\nbuyer\u2019s remorse, or who for no reason at all wishes to return to the bargaining table without\n\nproviding a basis for doing so, need only append by email, or some separate writing, not\n\nagreed to or considered by the other party, a condition precedent that undercuts a carefully\n\ncrafted agreement that otherwise thoroughly and exclusively states the parties\u2019 mutual\n\nassent. With the Majority\u2019s view, where the record shows no disagreement by Ms. Pattison\n\nas to any term in the actual Settlement Agreement, the trial court\u2019s ability to make\n\ncredibility determinations, and most importantly, to resolve the case, has been effectively\n\nundercut. Ms. Pattison and other family law parties should not benefit from an incorrect\n\nformed a binding contract through mutual assent on September 25th \u2013 offer accepted. A\nmore apt analogy than the one posed by the Majority is where X and Y agree to the $200\ncar sale. Y signs a promissory note for $200, and X signs over title. Two hours later, X\nsends Y a text saying the sale is conditioned on my getting the $200 within the next 15\nminutes. Even where Y actually sees the text message (something that did not happen here\naccording to the trial court), this post hoc condition cannot retroactively alter the binding\nagreement already executed. It is exactly the Majority\u2019s elevation of the unilateral, post-\nexecution Cover Letter over the express and integrated terms of the Settlement Agreement\nthat is problematic, particularly here where the language of the Settlement Agreement\nprecludes precisely the kind of maneuver Wife has now effected with the Majority\u2019s\nendorsement.\n\fconstruct of contract law that prolongs the case by an unexpected condition precedent that\n\nwas wholly unreasonable under the circumstances. Gaming the resolution of family law\n\ncases in this manner benefits no one.\n\nThe trial court made no error in enforcing the Settlement Agreement based on the\n\nevidence before it, and the Majority identifies none \u2013 other than its argument that the\n\ninadmissible post-hoc Cover Letter was a valid condition precedent and is dispositive. The\n\nMajority offers no workable guidance to trial courts facing belated or collateral attacks on\n\nsettlement agreements. When does a \u201ccondition\u201d in a post-execution cover letter become\n\na valid condition precedent? Does mutual assent disappear simply because one party signs\n\nthe contract a few days after the other \u2013 particularly when sequential execution was\n\nanticipated? Does an integration clause preclude the enforcement of extrinsic terms that\n\ncontradict the agreement itself? And what role should trial courts play in enforcing written\n\nagreements when alleged conditions appear nowhere in the agreement and were never\n\nagreed to by the other party? I do not know the answers to these questions after reading\n\nthe Majority opinion. Instead, the Majority provides a roadmap for undoing signed\n\nsettlement agreements, undermining Maryland\u2019s strong public policy in favor of finality\n\nand resolution.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Majority opinion. Justice\n\nEaves has authorized me to state that she joins this dissent.\n\n18"

Answering only the question of liability, a jury found that Open\n\nfraudulently induced the City to enter the contract. The City elected to rescind\n\nthe contract, so the district court held a bench trial on restitution and ordered a\n\njudgment of almost $20 million against Open.\n\nOpen appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denials of its\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law. Because we find no error with the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s rulings or the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm. 2\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nIn February 2018, the City published a request for proposal (RFP) for a\n\nbilling software system for municipal utilities, including a new broadband\n\nutility called Connexion. On March 12, 2018, Open submitted a proposal for\n\nthe project based on its forthcoming software, Open SmartFlex Version 8. Open\n Except where the distinction matters, we refer to Open International and\nOpen Investments collectively as \u201cOpen.\u201d\n On February 19, 2025, Open moved for leave to file a supplemental\nappendix. We deny that motion.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 3\n\nclaimed that its product \u201ccomplie[d] with the vast majority of functional and\n\ntechnical requirements of th[e] RFP with one single and uniform product[.]\u201d\n\nSupp. App. vol. 4, at 1011 (emphasis omitted).\n\nThe RFP included a functional matrix that listed all the functional\n\nrequirements needed for the product and that directed bidders to complete the\n\nmatrix \u201caccurately and factually\u201d according to the provided grading rubric.\n\nSupp. App. vol. 8, at 2143. In its RFP response, Open graded about 90% of its\n\nhomegrown software\u2019s functionalities with \u201cA\u2019s,\u201d representing that the\n\nfunctionality was \u201cpart of [its software\u2019s] base system\u201d and that \u201c[n]o\n\n[m]odification [was] required.\u201d App. vol. 2, at 3.\n\nThe City selected Open International to be its vendor. And the parties\n\nformalized their contract with a Master Professional Services Agreement, in\n\nwhich Open Investments guaranteed Open International\u2019s performance under\n\nthe contract but made no contractual representations of its own. The contract\u2019s\n\nintroduction incorporates by reference the RFP and Open\u2019s proposal, which\n\nincludes the detailed functionality matrix for the services that Open\n\nInternational was to provide.\n\nThe project kicked off in late 2018 and suffered problems from the\n\nbeginning. One of the main sources of conflict was the customer self-service\n\nportal for the City\u2019s broadband-billing services. The service went live in\n\nAugust 2019 and had \u201ccritical functionality missing.\u201d App. vol. 7, at 68\u201369. In\n\nNovember 2019, the City cited the portal as one of its primary concerns, stating\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 4\n\nthat the \u201cportal testing hours [have been] extensive\u201d and that the \u201cpresented\n\nportal was different than what got delivered[.]\u201d App. vol. 9, at 26\u201327.\n\nDespite these problems, the City continued its contractual relationship\n\nwith Open International. Throughout the project, the parties negotiated and\n\nexecuted twenty-nine project change requests (PCRs), including PCR 19, which\n\naddressed issues relating to the customer portal. In a March 2020 memorandum,\n\nthe City\u2019s external project manager documented her concerns over problems\n\nwith Open International\u2019s product, but still recommended that the City preserve\n\nits relationship with Open International. And in June 2020, both parties agreed\n\nto a formal amendment that extended project milestones into 2021 and assigned\n\nmost of the added project costs to the City. The parties again agreed to extend\n\nthe project in December 2020.\n\nPrompted by this second amendment, the City hired a third-party\n\nconsultant to assess the project. In an April 2021 report, the consultant advised\n\nthe City to continue the project with Open International despite the project\n\ndelays and frustrations. Completing the project with Open International\n\nremained \u201cPlan A\u201d for the City. App. vol. 7, at 120\u201321. The parties jointly\n\nreviewed the functional matrix to evaluate whether the program was performing\n\nas Open had represented it would. But during the review in April and May\n\n2021, the City determined that Open\u2019s precontractual assertions about its\n\nsoftware\u2019s capabilities were false.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 5\n\nAlso during the review, Open International sent the City a notice of\n\ndefault stating that it could not proceed with its work unless and until the City\n\ncured certain deficiencies. From the City\u2019s view, that default notice \u201cwas a\n\nsignificant breach of trust.\u201d Id. at 123. Then on May 28, 2021, the City served\n\nits own notices\u2014a notice of dispute and notice of termination. In June, Open\n\nInternational provided a \u201cReset Proposal\u201d that acknowledged the results of the\n\nfunctional matrix audit\u2014which showed that only 17.3% of the \u201c[i]n scope\u201d\n\nrequirements had been accepted\u2014and sought additional funds to complete the\n\nproject. Supp. App. vol. 9, at 2473. But the proposal would not cure the issues\n\nwithin the thirty days required by the contract, so the City initiated this lawsuit\n\non July 2, 2021. The City also promptly retained a second vendor and began\n\nimplementing that product, and it stopped all use of Open International\u2019s\n\nproduct as soon as the new platform was available in December 2021.\n\nII. Procedural Background\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the City sued Open for breach of contract, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, and fraud-in-the-inducement. The City based its tort claims\n\non misrepresentations about (1) the timing for executing the project and the\n\nlevel of support Open International would provide, (2) Open International\u2019s\n\nsoftware being \u201cready for implementation,\u201d and (3) the fitness of Open\n\nInternational\u2019s software for the City\u2019s needs. App. vol. 3, at 60\u201361 \u00b6\u00b6 70\u201373.\n\nOpen pleaded affirmative defenses and asserted a counterclaim for breach of\n\ncontract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 6\n\nDuring discovery, the City learned that despite Open grading almost 90%\n\nof the required functionalities as an \u201cA\u201d in its March 2018 RFP response, Open\n\nhad internally assessed its software as meeting only 59.4% of the required\n\nfunctionalities. Open\u2019s internal assessment was dated in March 2018, before it\n\nresponded to the RFP. Also, the City learned that Open had not graded the\n\nprovided software\u2014a third-party portal called \u201cMilestone\u201d\u2014in the\n\nfunctionality matrix but had instead graded its \u201chomegrown\u201d software. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 254\u201355.\n\nOpen moved for summary judgment on the City\u2019s tort claims, arguing\n\nthat the claims were barred by the contract\u2019s merger clause and Colorado\u2019s\n\neconomic-loss rule, and that the City had waived the claims by repeatedly\n\naffirming the contract. The district court denied the motion. See City of Fort\n\nCollins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-MEH, 2023 WL 3585214,\n\nat *1, *13 (D. Colo. May 22, 2023). Open then asked the court to require the\n\nCity to elect a remedy before trial\u2014either affirming the contract and receiving\n\ndamages or rescinding the contract and receiving restitution. But the court\n\ndecided that the City would not have to select a remedy until the jury returned a\n\nverdict on the tort claims. City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-\n\nCV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2023 WL 11868279, at *2, *4 (D. Colo. Sept. 27, 2023).\n\nIf the City elected damages, the jury would be instructed on the breach-of-\n\ncontract claims and counterclaims; if the City elected rescission, the jury would\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 7\n\nbe dismissed, and the court would hold a bench trial on rescission and\n\nrestitution.\n\nThe trial started on October 23, 2023, and lasted ten days. At the close of\n\nevidence, Open moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the breach-of-contract claim and the tort claims.\n\nThe court denied the motion. Then the court gave the jury \u201call of the general\n\nclosing instructions,\u201d but only the fraud and negligent-misrepresentation\n\n\u201cclaim-specific instructions.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 58\u201359. For each of the tort claims,\n\nthe verdict form asked whether the City had proved the claim against \u201cOpen\u201d\n\nand whether \u201cOpen\u201d had proved waiver or expiration of the statute of\n\nlimitations. App. vol. 6, at 4\u20136. The district court instructed the jury to find\n\nwaiver if:\n\n1. The City learned the actual or true facts after it began the project\n with Open, but before it ceased the project with Open; and\n 2. The City continued the project with Open with full knowledge of\n the actual facts when a reasonable person under the same or similar\n circumstances would not have done so.\nApp. vol. 5, at 165. Open objected to the City\u2019s request that the instruction\n\nspecify, \u201cfull knowledge of all the actual facts,\u201d but it did not otherwise object\n\nto the waiver instruction. App. vol. 15, at 7 (emphasis added).\n\nThe jury determined that the City had proved fraudulent inducement and\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, but that the City had waived the negligent-\n\nmisrepresentation claim. The City elected to rescind the contract, so the court\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 8\n\ndismissed the jury. And because the City elected to rescind the contract, Open\u2019s\n\ncounterclaim for breach of contract disappeared.\n\nOpen timely renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nRule 50(b). And as part of its rescission brief, it also moved under Rule 52(c)\n\nfor partial judgment, arguing (1) that the City\u2019s evidence did not support a\n\nrestitution award and (2) that the City had waived rescission as a remedy. 3 The\n\ncourt denied the Rule 52(c) motion, City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No.\n\n1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *11\u201312 (D. Colo. Mar. 21,\n\n2024), and entered judgment against \u201cOpen\u201d for just under $20 million. Open\n\nagain moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and moved\n\nunder Rule 52(b) for amended or additional findings and Rules 59(a) and (e) for\n\namendment of the judgment or a new trial. The court orally denied those\n\nmotions and the earlier Rule 50(b) motion. Open timely appealed, and we have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 4\n The district court correctly noted that Rule 52 is reserved for nonjury\ntrials, but nonetheless addressed Open\u2019s arguments \u201cin the hopes of obviating\nthe need to address the[] matters in the future[.]\u201d City of Fort Collins v. Open\nInt\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *2\u20133 (D.\nColo. Mar. 21, 2024).\n The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\nOpen International and Open Investments are both Florida limited liability\ncompanies and their members are all Florida citizens. And Fort Collins is a city\nin Colorado, so it is a Colorado citizen. See App. vol. 3, at 47 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20135.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 9\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOpen presents four arguments on appeal: (1) that Colorado\u2019s economic-\n\nloss rule and the parties\u2019 contract bar the City\u2019s tort claims; (2) that insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of fraud; (3) that the City waived its\n\nability to rescind the contract; and (4) that Open Investments cannot be held\n\nliable for the rescission award.\n\nI. Tort Claims Not Barred\n\nFirst, Open asserts that the district court erred by denying its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, which argued that the City\u2019s tort claims were\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule and the parties\u2019 contract.\n\n\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d Fresquez v.\n\nBNSF Ry. Co., 52 F.4th 1280, 1295 (10th Cir. 2022). In reviewing the denial of\n\nsuch a motion, \u201cwe draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty,\u201d and we reverse \u201conly if the evidence points but one way and is\n\nsusceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the nonmovant.\u201d Id.\n\nA. Colorado\u2019s Economic-Loss Rule\n\n\u201cUnder the economic loss rule, a party suffering only economic loss from\n\nthe breach of an express or implied contractual duty may not assert a tort claim\n\nfor such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.\u201d Mid-\n\nCentury Ins. Co. v. HIVE Constr., Inc., 567 P.3d 153, 158 (Colo. 2025)\n\n(citation modified). Though it is termed the \u201ceconomic loss rule,\u201d a \u201cmore\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 10\n\naccurate designation . . . would be the \u2018independent duty rule\u2019\u201d because the\n\n\u201ckey to determining the availability of a contract or tort action lies in\n\ndetermining the source of the duty that forms the basis of the action.\u201d Town of\n\nAlma v. AZCO Constr., Inc., 10 P.3d 1256, 1262 & n.8 (Colo. 2000).\n\nTo determine whether a tort duty arises independent of a contract,\n\nColorado courts ask: \u201c(1) whether the relief sought in [tort] is the same as the\n\ncontractual relief; (2) whether there is a recognized common law duty of care in\n\n[tort]; and (3) whether the [tort] duty differs in any way from the contractual\n\nduty.\u201d 5 BRW, Inc. v. Dufficy & Sons, Inc., 99 P.3d 66, 74 (Colo. 2004). After\n\nexamining each factor, we conclude that the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by\n\nthe economic-loss rule.\n\nFirst, the City is seeking the same relief in tort that it is seeking under\n\nthe contract. In its complaint, the City sought rescission for both the tort and\n\ncontract claims, and alternatively sought damages for its contract claim. App.\n Though the Colorado Supreme Court has never held as much, dicta in\nColorado cases suggest that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not apply\nto intentional tort claims.\u201d Mid-Century Ins. Co., 567 P.3d at 156\u201357; see, e.g.,\nUnited Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1226 (10th\nCir. 2000) (\u201cIt is settled in Colorado that the economic loss rule applies only to\ntort claims based on negligence[.]\u201d); Bermel v. BlueRadios, Inc., 440 P.3d\n1150, 1153, 1154 n.6 (Colo. 2019) (observing that previous cases had applied\nthe economic-loss rule \u201cto bar only certain common law negligence claims\u201d and\nstating that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not be available to shield\nintentional tortfeasors from liability for misconduct that happens also to breach\na contractual obligation\u201d); Town of Alma, 10 P.3d at 1263 (citing Brody v.\nBock, 897 P.2d 769, 776 (Colo. 1995), a case that involved a common-law\nfraud claim, as an example of a common-law tort that is independent of a\nbreach-of-contract claim).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 11\n\nvol. 3, at 62 \u00b6 79 (rescission for tort claim), 64 \u00b6 89 (rescission for contract\n\nclaim, alternatively damages); see also id. at 47 \u00b6 2. So this factor supports\n\nOpen\u2019s view that the economic-loss rule bars the City\u2019s tort claims. See Dream\n\nFinders Homes LLC v. Weyerhaeuser NR Co., 506 P.3d 108, 121 (Colo. App.\n\n2021).\n\nSecond, because fraudulent inducement is a common-law tort claim,\n\n\u201cthere is a recognized common law duty of care in [tort.]\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74;\n\nsee also Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., 373 P.3d 603, 607 (Colo. 2016).\n\nSo this factor supports the City.\n\nThird, and most critically, \u201cthe [tort] duty differs . . . from the\n\ncontractual duty.\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74. Open claims that the parties\u2019 contract\n\n\u201cset[s] out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is based\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cthe grades Open assigned to thousands of software functionalities in its\n\nresponse to the City\u2019s RFP, and the City\u2019s claim that some of the delivered\n\nfunctionalities were inferior to those representations.\u201d Op. Br. at 25\u201326. So\n\nbecause the contract incorporated those grades and provided the requirements\n\nfor Open\u2019s software service, Open concludes that the contract subsumes the\n\nCity\u2019s fraud claim. We disagree.\n\nTorts based on precontractual conduct are often found to be independent\n\nof the contract. In re Bloom, 622 B.R. 366, 429 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2020)\n\n(collecting cases). For example, in Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., the\n\nColorado Supreme Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 12\n\nhad \u201cwrongfully induced him into entering a contractual relationship knowing\n\nthat it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised [services]\u201d\n\nestablished \u201ca violation of a tort duty that is independent of the contract.\u201d 373\n\nP.3d at 607. The court explained that \u201c[t]here is an important distinction\n\nbetween failure to perform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party\n\nto enter a contract in the first place.\u201d Id. It said that the \u201ccritical question\u201d was\n\nnot whether the tort claims were \u201crelated to the promises that eventually formed\n\nthe basis of the contract,\u201d but \u201cwhether the tort claims flow[ed] from an\n\nindependent duty under tort law.\u201d Id.; cf. Keller v. A.O. Smith Harvestore\n\nProds., Inc., 819 P.2d 69, 73 (Colo. 1991) (\u201c[C]laims of negligent\n\nmisrepresentation are based not on principles of contractual obligation but on\n\nprinciples of duty and reasonable conduct.\u201d).\n\nVan Rees is on point with our case. There, the parties contracted for web-\n\nrelated services and the development of new websites. 373 P.3d at 605. The\n\ncontract specified what services were to be provided and when. Id. Like our\n\ncase, the defendant \u201cmissed deadlines and failed to deliver the promised\n\nservices.\u201d Id. That was the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Id.\n\nBut during contract negotiations, the defendant allegedly \u201cknew that it lacked\n\nsufficient staff to complete the website on time, and did not intend to provide\n\nthe [full services],\u201d so it induced the plaintiff into a contractual relationship\n\n\u201cknowing that it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised\n\nweb-related services.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. Like our case, the defendant\u2019s\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 13\n\nmisrepresentation about its capabilities formed the basis for the tort claim. Id.\n\nat 607. And that claim was \u201can independent duty that did not arise from the\n\ncontracts,\u201d so it was \u201cnot barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. The\n\nsame is true here. 6\n\nNotwithstanding Van Rees, Open asserts that the City\u2019s claims are still\n\nbarred because the contract memorialized all precontractual representations,\n\nwhich means that the contract subsumed any tort duty. See BRW, 99 P.3d at 74\n\n(\u201cIf we conclude that the duty of care owed by [the defendants] was\n\nmemorialized in the contracts, it follows that the plaintiff has not shown any\n\nduty independent of the interrelated contracts[.]\u201d). But none of Open\u2019s cited\n\ncases involve precontractual representations. See id. at 75 (distinguishing its\n\nfacts\u2014a misrepresentation \u201cduring performance\u201d of the contract\u2014from cases\n\ninvolving misrepresentations \u201cprior to the execution of an agreement\u201d (citation\n\nmodified)); Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 123 (finding no independent duty\n Open criticizes Van Rees\u2019s distinction between a failure to perform the\ncontract and promises that induce a party to enter a contract. Reply Br. at 15\u2013\n16. It relies on HealthBanc Int\u2019l, LLC v. Synergy Worldwide, Inc., a Utah\nSupreme Court decision in which the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to\nadopt a blanket rule that fraudulent inducement is \u201cnecessarily independent of\nthe contract\u201d and instead held that a fraudulent-inducement claim that \u201coverlaps\ncompletely\u201d with a breach-of-contract claim is barred by the economic-loss\nrule. 435 P.3d 193, 196\u201397 (Utah 2018). The court criticized the Colorado\nSupreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Van Rees, calling its distinction between\nperformance and inducement \u201cillusory\u201d when \u201cthe subject matter of the\ninducing promises [is] later negotiated for and included in the contract.\u201d Id. at\n197. But whatever the merits of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning,\nHealthBanc is not binding here because the parties\u2019 contract is governed by\nColorado law, not Utah law. So Van Rees still controls.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 14\n\nbecause the relevant \u201cconduct occurred after the parties entered into the\n\ncontract\u201d). The closest Open gets is Smart v. Stropas, which involved a seller\u2019s\n\nprecontractual nondisclosure of latent defects in the home. No. 24CA0614,\n\n2025 WL 274726, at *2\u20133 (Colo. App. Jan. 23, 2025) (unpublished). There,\n\nthough the intermediate-appellate court found that the economic-loss rule\n\nbarred the home-buyer\u2019s fraudulent-nondisclosure claim, the contract\n\nprovisions exactly tracked the alleged tort duty. Id. at *3. The parties\u2019 contract\n\nboth (1) required the sellers to disclose any knowledge of methamphetamine\n\nbeing \u201cmanufactured, processed, cooked, disposed of, used or stored at the\n\nProperty\u201d and (2) represented that the sellers had no knowledge of such\n\nmethamphetamine use. Id. at *1. So the tort duty to disclose latent defects\n\n(here, the methamphetamine use) did not \u201cdiffer[] in any way from the\n\ncontractual duty\u201d to disclose methamphetamine use. Id. at *4 (citation\n\nmodified). \u201cBecause the contract explicitly addressed the sellers\u2019 obligation to\n\ndisclose methamphetamine,\u201d the tort duty was subsumed by the contract and\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule. Id. at *3.\n\nThe same is not true for our case; the parties\u2019 contract warranted only the\n\nquality of Open International\u2019s performance, not the accuracy of Open\u2019s\n\nrepresentations about its capabilities. Though Open claims that the parties\u2019\n\ncontract \u201cset out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is\n\nbased\u201d\u2014to deliver software functionalities consistent with the representations\n\nin the contract, Op. Br. at 25\u2014we agree with the City that Open conflates \u201cits\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 15\n\nultimate failures to provide and deliver the software functionalities in breach of\n\nits contractual obligations\u201d with its \u201cfraudulent representations about its\n\nsoftware which induced the City into\u201d the contract, Resp. Br. at 29\u201330. See Van\n\nRees, 373 P.3d at 607 (\u201cThere is an important distinction between failure to\n\nperform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party to enter into a\n\ncontract in the first place.\u201d); see also Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 120 (\u201cThe\n\neconomic loss rule does not apply to claims arising from a defendant\u2019s pre-\n\ncontractual conduct because, at that time, there was no contract that could have\n\nsubsumed identical tort duties.\u201d). Like the plaintiff in Van Rees, the City\u2019s \u201ctort\n\nclaims are based on misrepresentations made prior to the formation of the\n\ncontracts,\u201d which fraudulently induced it to enter the contract \u201cand therefore\n\nviolated an independent duty in tort to refrain from such conduct.\u201d 373 P.3d at\n\n607. So applying Van Rees, the third factor supports the City and finding that\n\n\u201cthe claims are not barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id.\n\nAs a final argument, Open claims that the economic-loss rule bars the\n\nCity\u2019s claims because the City is recovering a remedy that is expressly\n\nexcluded under the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 125\n\n(\u201cSophisticated commercial entities . . . may not circumvent the exclusion of\n\ndamages in their contracts by cloaking their claims in tort theories.\u201d). The\n\ncontract states that \u201cOpen\u2019s entire liability\u201d for breaching any of the warranties\n\n\u201cwill be for Open to correct or reperform any nonconforming [s]ervices[.]\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 7 \u00b6 2.1. And though the limitations-of-liability provision\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 16\n\ncontemplates damages and limits the type and amount of damages that can be\n\nrecovered, recovery of damages is limited to (1) indemnification claims,\n\n(2) intentional breaches of the confidentiality and personally-identifiable-\n\ninformation provisions, and (3) unauthorized use of Open\u2019s intellectual\n\nproperty. See id. at 12\u201313 \u00b6\u00b6 12.1\u201312.2. Yet the City sought rescission and\n\nalternatively damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nBut Open doesn\u2019t cite any Colorado Supreme Court case that supports\n\nthat this is a relevant consideration for determining whether a tort duty is\n\nindependent of a contract. And the cases that Open does cite all involve tort\n\nduties that were subsumed by the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at\n\n123\u201325 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cduty to not make misrepresentations\n\nor engage in fraud after they entered into the contract\u201d was \u201csubsumed within\n\nthe contract through the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d and then\n\nobserving that the claimants sought to recover \u201cthe very category of damages\u201d\n\nthat was barred by the contract); RE/MAX, LLC v. Quicken Loans Inc., 295 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 1163, 1170 (D. Colo. 2018) (\u201c[T]o the extent that Quicken Loans\n\nalleges misrepresentations by RE/MAX that are memorialized in the [contract],\n\nthe parties allocated risk with respect to those obligations by contract, and tort\n\nclaims based on those obligations are barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)). So though the City seeks to recover a type of relief that the\n\ncontract prohibits, the conduct warranting the relief is independent of, and\n\ntherefore not governed by, the contract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 17\n\nThus, under Colorado law, the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by the\n\neconomic-loss rule.\n\nB. Merger Clause and Other Provisions\n\nOpen also contends that the contract\u2019s merger clause and limited-\n\nwarranty provisions bar the City\u2019s tort claims.\n\nThough a merger clause \u201climit[s] future contractual disputes to issues . . .\n\nexpressly set forth in the executed document,\u201d misrepresentation claims \u201care\n\nbased not on principles of contractual obligation but on principles of duty and\n\nreasonable conduct.\u201d Keller, 819 P.2d at 72\u201373. So the \u201cmere presence of a\n\ngeneral integration clause in an agreement does not bar a claim for negligent or\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Id. at 73. Instead, to \u201ceffect a waiver of a claim\n\nof negligent [or fraudulent] misrepresentation,\u201d the merger clause must\n\n\u201cspecifically prohibit[]\u201d the claim. Id.\n\nOpen asserts that the contract\u2019s merger clause bars the City\u2019s tort claims\n\nbecause it \u201cwas quite specific with its integration of Open\u2019s RFP response into\n\nthe contract and the parties\u2019 disclaimer of extracontractual representations and\n\npromises.\u201d Op. Br. at 23. But the merger clause says nothing about precluding\n\nclaims for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation. See App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15. Though Open is correct that the clause covers the SOW and\n\nfunctionality matrix, the inclusion of those documents \u201cdoes not specifically\n\npreclude\u201d a fraud claim. Keller, 819 P.2d at 73. So the mere fact of a merger\n\nclause \u201cdoes not effect a waiver of [the tort] claim.\u201d Id. And unlike Steak n\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 18\n\nShake Enterprises, Inc. v. Globex Co., LLC, in which the court found that a\n\nmerger clause precluded a fraudulent-inducement claim because it disproved\n\nreliance \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d 110 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1083 (D. Colo. 2015), the\n\nmerger clause here says nothing about reliance. Compare App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15, with Steak n Shake, 110 F. Supp. 3d at 1083 (merger clause stating that\n\nthe \u201cFranchisees were entering into the agreement as a result of their own\n\ninvestigation and not as a result of any representation by Plaintiffs\u201d); see also\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 6 (contract introduction stating that \u201cthe City has proceeded\n\nwith reasonable reliance on Open\u2019s representations\u201d). So the merger clause\n\ndoes not bar the City\u2019s tort claim.\n\nOpen also asserts that the contract\u2019s limited-warranty provisions bar a\n\ntort claim because they \u201cexpressly disclaim[] reliance on precontractual\n\nrepresentations[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 24. Even if that were true (it\u2019s not), Open has\n\nwaived this argument by presenting it for the first time on appeal. 7 See\n Open claims it preserved this argument by \u201cma[king] a cogent and\ncomplete argument . . . discussing the complete and specific integration of the\nfunctionality matrix [and the] specific merger clause\u201d in its post-trial and\nsummary judgment motions, and that circuit precedent does not \u201crequire a\nlisting of every piece of evidence supporting an argument.\u201d Reply Br. at 17\u201318\n(citing Perez v. El Tequila, LLC, 847 F.3d 1247, 1256 (10th Cir. 2017)). But\nOpen misreads Perez. In Perez, we determined that the appellant had preserved\nits issues on appeal because the \u201cRule 50(a) motions contained identical\narguments\u201d as the Rule 50(b) motion. 847 F.3d at 1255\u201356 (emphasis added).\nThough the Rule 50(b) motion \u201cdid not rely upon the exact same facts\u201d as the\nearlier motions, we noted that such \u201ctechnical precision [was] unnecessary.\u201d Id.\n(emphasis added) (citation modified). But here, Open didn\u2019t simply fail to\ninclude certain facts\u2014it failed to include the argument itself. In its Rule 50(a)\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 19\n\nKnowlton v. Teltrust Phones, Inc., 189 F.3d 1177, 1183 (10th Cir. 1999) (\u201cBy\n\nfailing to timely raise the issue to the district court, [the defendant] waived the\n\nissue[.]\u201d).\n\nNeither the economic-loss rule nor the contract\u2019s merger clause bar the\n\nCity\u2019s tort claims, so we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Open\u2019s motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\n\nII. Sufficient Evidence of Fraud\n\nSecond, Open asserts that we should reverse the jury\u2019s verdict because\n\n\u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence of an actual and actionable material\n\nmisrepresentation.\u201d Op. Br. at 21 (emphasis omitted).\n\n\u201cWhen a jury verdict is challenged on appeal, our review is limited to\n\ndetermining whether the record\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party\u2014contains substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nBangert Bros. Constr. Co., Inc. v. Kiewit W. Co., 310 F.3d 1278, 1292 (10th\n\nCir. 2002) (citation modified). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something less than the\n\nweight of the evidence, and is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable\n\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if different\n\nconclusions also might be supported by the evidence.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nand (b) motions, Open argued only that \u201cthe economic loss rule and integration\nclause bar the City\u2019s fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims[.]\u201d App. vol.\n5, at 126 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (citation modified); see also App. vol. 6, at 151\n(Rule 50(b) Motion). The motions did not mention the limited-warranty\nprovisions.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 20\n\n\u201cBecause the jury has the exclusive function of appraising credibility,\n\ndetermining the weight to be given to the testimony, drawing inferences from\n\nthe facts established, resolving conflicts in the evidence, and reaching ultimate\n\nconclusions of fact, this standard of review is quite deferential to the jury\u2019s\n\nverdict.\u201d Knowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183\u201384 (citation modified).\n\nAt trial, the City alleged three misrepresentations: (1) the projected\n\ntiming for deliveries, (2) the statement in the RFP response that Version 8 of\n\nthe software had been released in 2017, and (3) Open\u2019s grading of the\n\nfunctionality matrix and its use of a software portal other than its homegrown\n\nportal. Because the parties and the district court focus on mainly the third\n\nmisrepresentation, and because we conclude that there is sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting that the third misrepresentation was fraudulent, we do not discuss\n\nthe other alleged misrepresentations.\n\nA. The Functionality Matrix\n\nThe City contends that \u201c[t]he most striking example of Open\u2019s false\n\nrepresentation was its fraudulent grading of its software in response to the\n\nCity\u2019s RFP in March 2018.\u201d Resp. Br. at 15. In Open\u2019s RFP response, Open\n\ngraded 89.7% of the required functionalities as \u201cA,\u201d or as already existing in\n\nthe current software system. But trial evidence showed that Open had internally\n\ngraded only 59.4% of its functionalities as the equivalent of an \u201cA.\u201d And\n\nbecause the internal grading was never disclosed to the City, the City claims\n\nthat Open\u2019s RFP response fraudulently represented its functionalities.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 21\n\nOpen claims that it accurately graded its functionalities based on the\n\nRFP\u2019s requirements. Below are the RFP\u2019s requirements for an \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d\n\ngrade:\n\nApp. vol. 2, at 3. Open asserts (1) that \u201cunrefuted trial testimony\u201d showed that\n\nOpen\u2019s grading was consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions and (2) that its\n\ninternal assessment cannot sustain the City\u2019s fraud claim because it \u201csorted the\n\nfunctionalities using different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a\n\ndifferent type of internal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39.\n\nAt trial, Open International\u2019s president explained that Open\u2019s grading\n\nwas consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions because the instructions asked about\n\nfunctionalities in Open International\u2019s base code, not functionalities in a\n\nreleased version of the software. App. vol. 12, at 184\u201385, 189\u201395. And because\n\nan \u201cA\u201d grade meant that the \u201c[d]esired functionality is achieved through\n\nconfiguration,\u201d even an \u201cA\u201d grade required some level of additional work. App.\n\nvol. 2, at 3; App. vol. 12, at 192\u201393; see also App. vol. 11, at 42 (the City\u2019s\n\nthird-party consultant testifying that \u201cconfiguration\u201d involves \u201cfive-plus\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 22\n\nthings\u201d). Open claims that the City\u2019s expert witness corroborated this testimony\n\nby agreeing that Open could grade a functionality as an \u201cA\u201d if that\n\nfunctionality was present in an earlier version of the software (but not the\n\nunreleased Version 8) so long as Open stated that the functionality was in an\n\nearlier version. See App. vol. 11, at 133\u201334. So Open concludes that the\n\nrepresentations were true and cannot support a finding of fraud.\n\nOpen also contends that its internal assessment \u201csorted the functionalities\n\nusing different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a different type of\n\ninternal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39. Below is a summary table of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment:\n\nApp. vol. 22, at 16. At trial, the City argued that the internal assessment\n\nshowed that only 59.4% of the functionalities (the \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d\n\ncategory) should have been given an \u201cA\u201d grade. But Open contends that its\n\ninternal assessment \u201cmerely broke down the RFP\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 grade into two\n\nsubcategories\u201d: \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d and \u201c[p]lanned for 2018.\u201d Reply Br.\n\nat 10. Open International\u2019s president testified that both categories had the\n\nrequired existing base code, but that the functionalities in the \u201c[c]urrent\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 23\n\nfunctionalities\u201d category were already integrated into Version 8 while the\n\nfunctionalities in the \u201c[p]lanned for 2018\u201d category would be integrated later in\n\n2018.

So we agree\n\nwith the district court that there was a \u201cdispute about what is A [grade] versus\n\nwhat [is] B [grade]\u201d and that it was \u201ccompletely a jury decision to conclude\n\nwhether [Open] was making those representations as to a current fact or a fact\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 24\n\nin effect at the time the product went live[.]\u201d Resp\u2019t Add. at 13. The jury made\n\nits decision and \u201c[w]e do not retry issues, second guess the jury\u2019s decision-\n\nmaking, or assess the credibility of witnesses and determine the weight to be\n\ngiven their testimony.\u201d Stroup v. United Airlines Inc., 26 F.4th 1147, 1157\n\n(10th Cir. 2022) (citation modified).\n\nOpen also asserts that the grades given to the various functionalities in\n\nthe functionality matrix are not actionable misrepresentations because the\n\nparties\u2019 contract stated that the criteria for the matrix and RFP response were\n\n\u201copen to interpretation\u201d and fraud claims cannot \u201crest on articulations of\n\nopinion or belief.\u201d Op. Br. at 38, 41. But Open did not present this argument in\n\nthe district court. See App. vol. 5, at 122\u201324 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (asserting\n\nthat the City had not proven a misrepresentation because \u201cthe functional matrix\n\ninstructions required those functionalities to be delivered at go-live,\u201d not at the\n\ntime Open submitted its RFP response); App. vol. 6, at 147\u201348 (Rule 50(b)\n\nMotion) (\u201cNothing in the RFP requested a vendor to grade its then-existing\n\nsoftware[.]\u201d). So it is waived. See Knowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183.\n\nGiven the conflicting testimony about Open\u2019s internal assessment and its\n\nRFP response, the jury had sufficient evidence to find that Open fraudulently\n\nrepresented its functionalities.\n\nB. Grading a Different Portal\n\nThe City also asserts that the jury could have found fraudulent\n\ninducement because of what Open graded. Despite allegedly knowing on March\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 25\n\n1, 2018, that it planned to stop developing its homegrown portal and instead\n\nuse the Milestone portal, Open still graded its homegrown portal for the RFP\n\nresponse. Open argues that this cannot support a fraud claim because the City\n\nadmitted at trial that it knew before signing the contract that Open International\n\nplanned to use the Milestone portal and because the City had described an early\n\ndemonstration of the portal as being \u201cexactly as expected when we selected\n\nOpen Smartflex.\u201d App. vol. 18, at 177; see also App. vol. 9, at 88\u201389; App. vol.\n\n12, at 196\u201397. Though the City knew that Open International was using the\n\nMilestone portal for the contract, Open International\u2019s president agreed at trial\n\nthat \u201c[n]o one at Open told the City [that Open] did not grade the Milestone\n\nportal in the RFP response[.]\u201d App. vol. 13, at 254\u201355. Again, because there\n\nwas conflicting testimony on this issue, we defer to the jury\u2019s finding. See\n\nKnowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183\u201384 (\u201c[T]he jury has the exclusive function of . . .\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, and reaching ultimate conclusions of\n\nfact[.]\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict finding Open liable\n\nfor fraudulent inducement.\n\nIII. Ability to Rescind\n\nThird, Open asserts that because the City knew of multiple problems with\n\nthe software and its implementation by spring 2020, yet continued to affirm the\n\ncontract, the City waived its right to rescind the contract.\n\n\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable time, but what\n\nconstitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a particular case and\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 26\n\nmust be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d Ralston Oil & Gas Co. v. July Corp.,\n\n719 P.2d 334, 340 (Colo. App. 1985). We review \u201cfindings of fact for clear\n\nerror.\u201d Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 826 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nA \u201cfinding of fact is not clearly erroneous unless it is without factual support in\n\nthe record, or if the appellate court, after reviewing all the evidence, is left with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Mile High\n\nIndus. v. Cohen, 222 F.3d 845, 854 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation modified).\n\nA. The Waiver Rule\n\nThe district court instructed the jury to find that Open proved \u201cthe\n\naffirmative defense of waiver\u201d if the City \u201ccontinued the project with Open\n\nwith full knowledge of the actual facts when a reasonable person under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances would not have done so.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 166.\n\nThat instruction is based on Elk River Associates v. Huskin, in which a\n\nColorado appellate court explained that \u201c[t]o sustain the defense of ratification\n\nand waiver, it must appear that the defrauded party, with full knowledge of the\n\ntruth respecting the false representations, elected to continue to carry out the\n\nagreement.\u201d 691 P.2d 1148, 1153 (Colo. App. 1984).\n\nBut Open contends that \u201cthe \u2018full knowledge\u2019 requirement comes into\n\nplay only if one elects to affirm the agreement and thereafter continues to carry\n\nit out and receive its benefits, which would then result in a remedy of damages,\n\nnot rescission.\u201d Op. Br. at 36 (citation modified). Open asserts that to waive\n\nrescission, \u201c[i]t is not requisite that the defrauded party shall be acquainted\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 27\n\nwith all the evidence constituting the fraud[.]\u201d Id. at 35 (quoting Gladden v.\n\nGuyer, 426 P.2d 953, 955 (Colo. 1967)). Instead, rescission is waived once a\n\nparty \u201chas evidence sufficient to reasonably actuate him to rescind the\n\ncontract[.]\u201d Id. (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955). So Open concludes that the\n\njury decided only whether the City had waived its ability to recover damages\n\nfor Open\u2019s fraud, not whether the City had waived its ability to rescind the\n\ncontract. 8\n\nWe disagree. As the district court correctly stated, \u201cColorado courts do\n\nnot treat fraudulent inducement waiver and recission waiver as separate claims,\n\ngoverned by different tests[.]\u201d Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *4;\n\naccord Gerbaz v. Hulsey, 288 P.2d 357, 363 (Colo. 1955) (\u201cIf [it] was actually\n\nthe fact [that the plaintiff misrepresented the contract] then defendant was in a\n\nposition to elect, when he discovered the fact, either to rescind the contract, or\n\nto sue for damages[.]\u201d (emphasis added)); Bankers Tr. Co. v. Int\u2019l Tr. Co., 113\n\nP.2d 656, 664 (Colo. 1941) (\u201c[T]he right to rescind and sue [is] waived\u201d if \u201cthe\n\ndefrauded party, with full knowledge, intentionally condoned the fraud,\n\naffirmed the contract and abandoned all right to recover damages.\u201d). A party\n\nwaives the right to rescind when it has full knowledge of the material fact of\n Open\u2019s argument in the district court was a little different. Rather than\nseparating the waiver rules based on two types of remedies (damages and\nrescission), it separated the waiver rules based on whether the plaintiff was\npursuing a claim or seeking a remedy. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934,\nat *3.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 28\n\nthe fraud, even if it does not know all the underlying details of the fraud. See\n\nTisdel v. Cent. Sav. Bank & Tr. Co., 6 P.2d 912, 917 (Colo. 1931) (finding\n\nwaiver because the defendant had \u201cfull knowledge of the falsity of the\n\nrepresentations, and [] all the material facts respecting the same well in mind\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)); Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955 (\u201cThe duty of rescinding arises\n\nimmediately upon acquiring knowledge of the substantial and material facts\n\nconstituting the fraud\u201d and \u201cno subsequent discovery of cumulative evidence\n\ncan operate to execute waiver of the fraud if one has in the meantime occurred,\n\nor to revise a once lost right of rescission.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation\n\nmodified)); see also In re Mascio, 454 B.R. 146, 151 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2011)\n\n(defining \u201cfull knowledge\u201d as \u201cthe substantial and material facts constituting\n\nthe fraud\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955)). So a party\n\nneed not elect rescission until \u201che becomes aware of facts or circumstances that\n\nentitle him to a rescission.\u201d Young v. Leech, 240 P. 692, 693 (Colo. 1925); see\n\nGerbaz, 288 P.2d at 363 (\u201c[T]he[] defendant was in a position to elect[] when\n\nhe discovered the fact[.]\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\nOpen claims that it makes sense to have separate waiver rules for\n\nrescission and claims for damages because it \u201cprevent[s] a party from waiting\n\nto see how their contract plays out before deciding whether to rescind or sue for\n\ndamages.\u201d Reply Br. at 19\u201320. But Open never explains why \u201cwaiting to see\n\nhow the[] contract plays out\u201d before suing for damages should be treated\n\ndifferently than \u201cwaiting to see how the[] contract plays out\u201d before rescinding.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 29\n\nId. Indeed, the point of waiver is to prevent the \u201cwaiting to see how the[]\n\ncontract plays out\u201d part. See Stoner v. Marshall, 358 P.2d 1021, 1023 (Colo.\n\n1961) (\u201c[The] election [of rescission or damages] must be promptly made . . .\n\notherwise one might, with knowledge of fraud, speculate upon the advantages\n\nor disadvantages of an agreement, receive its benefits, and thereafter repudiate\n\nall its obligations.\u201d (citation modified)). Though Open is correct that many\n\ncases the City and the district court cite involve claims for damages instead of\n\nrescission, it has not persuasively explained why that matters. Regardless of the\n\nremedy, the question is whether the party waived its right to recovery by acting\n\nlike everything was okay under the contract and then turning around and\n\nseeking recovery for the very conduct it chose to ignore.\n\nSo the district court properly instructed the jury on waiver, and we now\n\nconsider whether the finding that the City did not waive its right to rescind the\n\ncontract was clearly erroneous.\n\nB. No Waiver\n\nThe jury found that the City did not waive its right to recover for Open\u2019s\n\nfraudulent inducement. And the district court accepted that factual finding. See\n\nOpen Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *3\u20134. Because this finding has factual\n\nsupport in the record, it was not clearly erroneous. See Cohen, 222 F.3d at 854;\n\ncf. Ralston Oil & Gas Co., 719 P.2d at 340 (holding that the trial court\u2019s\n\nconclusion \u201cthat plaintiff did not unreasonably delay seeking rescission of the\n\ncontract\u201d was \u201camply supported by the record\u201d).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 30\n\nOpen contends that the City knew these facts by spring 2020: (1) that the\n\nsoftware was untested and had not been installed for any other customer,\n\n(2) that the customer portal was not satisfactory and was not the portal\n\nrepresented during the vendor-selection process, (3) that the software\u2019s\n\nfunctionalities were only 58% of the required functionalities, and (4) that there\n\nwere significant issues with Open International\u2019s product. And Open asserts\n\nthat despite this knowledge, the City agreed to PCR 19, which was meant to\n\naddress the issues with the software and deliver complete functionality, and\n\nthus affirmed the contract and waived rescission.\n\nBut Open continues to conflate the problems with its software with its\n\nfraudulent precontractual representations; knowledge of these problems is not\n\nthe same as knowledge of fraud. Though the jury could have inferred\n\nknowledge of fraud based on knowledge of the above facts, it was not required\n\nto do so. The City\u2019s CFO testified that realizing Open\u2019s misrepresentations\n\n\u201cwas a gradual process\u201d and that the \u201cfunctional matrix work was the point in\n\ntime where [the CFO] said I think we may have gotten swindled.\u201d App. vol. 7,\n\nat 108. And there was evidence that the City did not learn of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment of the functionality matrix until discovery. See App. vol. 13, at\n\n254\u201355. So there was at least conflicting evidence about when the City\n\ndiscovered the fraud.\n\nOpen criticizes the City\u2019s CFO\u2019s testimony as \u201cconclusory, self-serving,\n\nand self-contradictory[.]\u201d Reply Br. at 21. But it was the jury\u2019s role to assess\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 31\n\nthe witnesses\u2019 credibility and weigh the evidence. See Bankers Trust Co., 113\n\nP.2d at 664 (\u201c[Q]uestions as to the time when plaintiff first discovered the\n\nfraud . . . are questions of fact for resolution by a jury.\u201d); Ralston Oil & Gas\n\nCo., 719 P.2d at 340 (\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable\n\ntime, but what constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a\n\nparticular case and must be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d). And \u201c[w]e do not\n\nretry issues, second guess the [factfinder]\u2019s decision making, or assess the\n\ncredibility of witnesses and determine the weight to be given their testimony.\u201d\n\nStroup, 26 F.4th at 1157 (citation modified)).\n\nBecause the court\u2019s (and the jury\u2019s) finding that the City did not waive\n\nits right to recover had support in the record, the finding is not clearly\n\nerroneous, and we affirm the rescission.\n\nIV. Open Investments\u2019 Liability\n\nFinally, Open challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion that argued that Open Investments could not be liable for rescission (a\n\ntort remedy) because it was only a guarantor of the contract and thus liable only\n\nfor contract damages. Alternatively, it argued that even if Open Investments\n\ncould be liable for rescission, there was insufficient evidence that Open\n\nInvestments made a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. 9 But we agree\n Open complains that the City \u201ceschewed\u201d its burden to prove each\ndefendant\u2019s liability \u201cby sleight-of-hand, using \u2018Open\u2019 as a trial shorthand to\nrefer to both defendants collectively.\u201d Op. Br. at 42. But in the district court,\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 32\n\nwith the district court that Open has long waived this argument. See Open Int\u2019l,\n\nLLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *5 (\u201c[T]his argument disclaiming any liability of\n\nOpen Investments comes far too late.\u201d).\n\nOpen argued for the first time in its Rule 50(b) motion, one month after\n\nthe jury had been dismissed, that Open Investments could not be held liable for\n\nthe rescission remedy. See App. vol. 17, at 176 (Q: \u201cPrior to your Rule 50[b]\n\nmotion, had this issue ever been brought up?\u201d A: \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t think it\n\nwas brought up until the election of remedies[.]\u201d). Because Open failed to make\n\nthis argument in its Rule 50(a) motion, and because the City objected to this\n\nnew argument, the issue is waived and we will not consider it on appeal. 10 See\n\nall parties consistently referred to Open International and Open Investments\ncollectively as \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cDefendants.\u201d See e.g., Supp. App. vol. 1, at 50\u201385\n(Open\u2019s Partial Motion for Summ. J.); App. vol. 2, at 184\u2013224 (Final Pretrial\nOrder); App. vol. 4, at 1\u20132 (Open\u2019s Motion to Compel Election of Remedies);\nApp. vol. 5, at 118\u201340 (Open\u2019s Rule 50(a) Motion); App. vol. 7, at 25 (Open\u2019s\nOpening Statement) (\u201cNow, who is Open? Open is not just one company, as the\njudge mentioned.\u201d). And Open never objected to the jury instructions or to the\nverdict form that referred to \u201cOpen\u201d collectively.\n Open asserts three reasons why its argument would not be waived.\nFirst, it repeats its earlier argument that \u201ctechnical precision [between Rule\n50(a) and Rule 50(b) motions] is unnecessary[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 43 (quoting Perez,\n847 F.3d at 1256). We reject that argument for the same reason we rejected it\nabove\u2014Open failed to make the argument in its motion. See Perez, 847 F.3d at\n1255\u201356. Second, Open claims that its argument is not waived under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 46, which provides that \u201c[f]ailing to object does not\nprejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was\nmade.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 46. But Open doesn\u2019t assert that it had no opportunity to\nobject; it asserts that \u201cthere was no reason for Open Investments to object[.]\u201d\nOp. Br. at 47 (emphasis added). So Rule 46 does not save Open\u2019s argument.\nThird, Open contends that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(5) preserves\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 33\n\nTherrien v. Target Corp., 617 F.3d 1242, 1250 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010)\n\n(\u201cOrdinarily a party cannot raise in a Rule 50(b) motion an argument not\n\nalready raised in its Rule 50(a) motion. But on appeal we can consider such an\n\nargument when the opposing party failed to object to the Rule 50(b) motion for\n\nraising new arguments.\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the district court\u2019s\n\ndenial of Open\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion on this issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denial of Open\u2019s\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nits claim. But Rule 52(a)(5)\u2019s directive that \u201c[a] party may later question the\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the [court\u2019s] findings, whether or not the\nparty . . . objected to them\u201d is reserved for nonjury trials. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a)(1) (\u201cIn General. In an action tried on the facts without a jury . . . the\ncourt must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law\nseparately.\u201d); see also Johnson v. Raemisch, 779 F. App\u2019x 507, 518 n.10 (10th\nCir. 2019) (\u201cRule 52 governs bench trials[.]\u201d). Though the restitution amount\nwas decided by the court, the issue Open challenges here\u2014its liability\u2014was\ntried before a jury. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *1\u20132. So Rule\n52 offers Open no help either. Open waived its argument.\n\n33"

The Older Americans\nAct (OAA) establishes funding mechanisms and an adminis-\ntrative framework to help states provide healthcare, housing,\nand community services for older persons. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001 et\nseq. States must jump through several hoops before securing\nOAA funding, including submitting a state plan, designating\n\f2 No. 23-2788\n\na state agency, and geographically dividing the state into dis-\ntinct planning and service areas. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027; 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(1). Then, for each service area, states must designate\na \u201cpublic or private nonprofit \u2026 as the area agency.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(2). At the heart of this case is whether those \u201carea\nagencies\u201d can sue to enforce OAA provisions and related Illi-\nnois state laws.\n One such area agency, the Northwestern Illinois Area\nAgency on Aging (NIAAA), filed state and federal suits\nagainst Paula Basta, the former Director of the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA). NIAAA\u2019s lawsuits alleged that Basta,\nin her personal and official capacities, deprived it and others\nof rights guaranteed by Illinois law and the OAA. Specifically,\nthe lawsuits alleged that Basta unlawfully refused to hold\nhearings on three administrative petitions that NIAAA filed.\n Ultimately, NIAAA lost both suits. The Illinois Supreme\nCourt first ruled in Basta\u2019s favor. Then, the federal district\ncourt dismissed NIAAA\u2019s suit on the grounds that it was\ntime-barred and failed to state a claim. After requesting entry\nof a final judgment, NIAAA brought this appeal raising a host\nof issues.\n We find no error and affirm across the board.\n\nI\n\nWe begin with the facts. At the pleadings stage, we accept\nall well-pled facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw\nall reasonable inferences in NIAAA's favor. Gociman v. Loyola\nUniv. of Chicago, 41 F.4th 873, 878 (7th Cir. 2022).\n\fNo. 23-2788 3\n\nA. Administrative Background\n\nAs noted above, the Older Americans Act (OAA) requires\nstates to take certain steps to designate area agencies respon-\nsible for providing services to senior citizens. Should states\nfail to comply with those requirements, the federal govern-\nment can take remedial measures, such as terminating fund-\ning. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027(d). Area agencies, in turn, serve\nas the \u201cpublic advocate[s] for the development or enhance-\nment of comprehensive and coordinated community-based\nsystems of services in each community throughout and spe-\ncific to each planning and service area.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1321.61(a);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3025(b)(5). Area agencies must develop a\nplan to provide services within their designated area and then\nsubmit that plan to state authorities. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3026(a).\n The Illinois Act on Aging designates the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA) as the \u201csingle State agency for receiving\nand disbursing federal funds made available under the \u2018Older\nAmericans Act.\u2019\u201d 20 ILCS 105/4. The IDA is responsible for\ncomplying with the OAA\u2019s provisions and \u201c[a]ssisting area\nagencies on aging in the development of comprehensive and\ncoordinated service delivery systems throughout the State.\u201d\n89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.10(a)(4). NIAAA is one such agency,\nwhich the IDA assigned to cover the state\u2019s nine northwest-\nernmost counties. Although an independent nonprofit,\nNIAAA receives more than ninety percent of its funding from\nthe IDA.\n Previously, Illinois regulations required the IDA to pro-\nvide agencies like NIAAA an opportunity for a hearing when\nthe IDA \u201cpropose[d] to disapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan \u2026 or withdraw from the agency\n\f4 No. 23-2788\n\ndesignation as an [area agency],\u201d when \u201cany eligible appli-\ncant for designation as a planning and service area under the\nprovisions of [the Act]\u201d has been denied, or for \u201cany nutrition\nproject that an area agency proposes to defund.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 215 N.E.3d 935, 948 (Ill. 2022) (citing 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n\u00a7 230.410 amended at 5 Ill. Reg. 3722 (eff. Mar. 31, 1981), re-\nnumbered at 7 Ill. Reg. 5178 (eff. July 27, 1983)). That regula-\ntion was amended effective August 2021. Under the amend-\nment, a hearing is to be provided to an area agency when the\nIDA proposes to: \u201c(A) [d]isapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan that has been submitted to the\n[IDA] by the [area agency]; or (B) [r]eject the [area agency\u2019s]\nrecommendation to designate a service provider.\u201d 89 Ill. Ad-\nmin. Code \u00a7 230.450(a)(1) (\u201c2021 Hearing Rule\u201d). The IDA\nalso has the right to \u201cconduct administrative hearings for\nother appeal requests concerning the health, safety and wel-\nfare of older individuals.\u201d 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.450(b).\n\nB. The Underlying Disputes\n\nIn June 2019, NIAAA requested an administrative hearing\n(\u201cInitial Petition\u201d) with the IDA. The petition presented two\ngrievances and requested findings that the IDA violated the\nIllinois Administrative Procedure Act, 5 ILCS 100/1\u20131 et seq.,\nby withholding funds from it, and that the Department also\nviolated Illinois law.\n The first grievance NIAAA aired in its Initial Petition\nstemmed from the fallout that occurred when NIAAA de-\ncided that the IDA\u2019s Adult Protective Services (APS) Manual\nwas invalid and ought to be recalled. In July 2013, NIAAA\nreached out to the IDA\u2019s then-director, John Holton, raising\nconcerns about the manual. Months later, Holton sent\n\fNo. 23-2788 5\n\nNIAAA a letter advising that the IDA was terminating\nNIAAA\u2019s FY2014 Adult Protective Services (APS) Grant, ef-\nfective January 2014. Fast forward to 2019. In April of that\nyear, the petition alleged, NIAAA\u2019s director and general\ncounsel, Grant Nyhammer, was told by an IDA employee that\nthe employee had been \u201cgiven an order [to] withhold funding\nfrom [NIAAA] to retaliate for [its] advocacy.\u201d Later that\nmonth, as outlined in the petition, Nyhammer asked Basta via\nemail to \u201cinvestigate funding being withheld\u201d from NIAAA.\nBasta responded that she could not speak to practices preced-\ning her tenure as director.\n From this emerged the second grievance NIAAA pre-\nsented in the Initial Petition\u2014that the IDA had refused\nNIAAA\u2019s administrative hearing request. The IDA denied the\nInitial Petition because it did not present a \u201ccontested case\u201d as\ndefined in the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act and\ntherefore did not require a hearing.\n Two months after submitting the Initial Petition, NIAAA\nsubmitted a second petition (\u201cAPS Petition\u201d) in August 2019.\nThe APS Petition raised grievances about events after the fil-\ning of the Initial Petition. This second petition requested a\nhearing and alleged that the IDA had improperly rejected\nNIAAA\u2019s designation of APS providers. As background, two\nmonths earlier, in June, NIAAA had designated APS provid-\ners for its service agency. The next month, the IDA responded\nthat the IDA was \u201cexercising its right to reject the [provider]\nrecommendations\u201d because of \u201cvarious deficiencies in the un-\nderlying [r]equest.\u201d NIAAA\u2019s APS Petition followed, which\nthe IDA denied by letter in September 2019. The letter in-\nformed NIAAA that the IDA \u201cis unable to provide a hearing\n\f6 No. 23-2788\n\nbecause the [APS Petition] fails to present a contested case\nthat would support the right to an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d\n Two years after its first two petitions were denied, NIAAA\nsubmitted a third petition (\u201cState Plan Appeal\u201d). This peti-\ntion, sent in September 2021, alleged that the IDA\u2019s state plan\nfor 2022\u20132024 did not comply with the OAA\u2019s regulations.\nLike the first two petitions, the third petition requested an ad-\nministrative hearing. In December 2021, the IDA responded\nwith a letter dismissing the petition because 89 Ill. Adm. Code\n230.420(d) only permitted area agency appeals in two limited\nand inapplicable circumstances.\n\nC. Court Proceedings\n\nOn November 5, 2019, NIAAA filed a complaint for man-\ndamus in Winnebago County Circuit Court. The state trial\ncourt denied relief, but the state appellate court reversed with\ninstructions for the IDA to conduct hearings on both the Ini-\ntial Petition and APS Petition. In its order remanding the mat-\nter, the appellate court concluded that the IDA\u2019s \u201csummary\ndismissals of [NIAAA\u2019s] petitions and its conclusory state-\nments that the petitions failed to present contested cases were\ninsufficient for meaningful judicial review.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 188 N.E.3d 1283, 1290 (Ill. App. Ct. 2022). The appellate\ncourt also held that the IDA was \u201crequired to give [NIAAA]\nadjudicatory hearings and determine the merits of its peti-\ntions.\u201d Id. at 1292. The case then made its way to the Illinois\nSupreme Court which disagreed with the state appellate court\nand, instead, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing\nthe mandamus complaint. Nyhammer v. Basta, 215 N.E.3d 935\n(Ill. 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 2497 (2023).\n\fNo. 23-2788 7\n\nHaving lost its administrative and state court challenges,\nNIAAA proceeded to federal court. On February 28, 2022,\nNIAAA filed a complaint against Paula Basta in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois. NIAAA pleaded ten causes of action\nagainst Basta in its First Amended Complaint: five in her per-\nsonal capacity (Counts I\u2013V) and five in her official capacity\n(Counts VI\u2013X). The allegations at issue in this appeal are as\nfollows:\n Count I: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s hearing rights under the\n OAA;\n Count II: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s right to function as a public\n advocate as defined by the OAA;\n Count III: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n Initial Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count IV: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n APS Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count V: the IDA\u2019s regulation on hearings (as\n amended and codified under 89 Ill. Admin.\n Code \u00a7 230.410, which the parties refer to as the\n \u201cHearing Rule\u201d) denies NIAAA its right to a\n hearing under the OAA and thereby deprives\n NIAAA of due process.\nCounts I\u2013V were brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Counts VI\u2013\nX involved pendant state law claims. NIAAA sought dam-\nages in excess of $75,000, attorneys\u2019 fees, and declaratory\njudgments that (1) Basta unlawfully failed to provide\n\f8 No. 23-2788\n\nhearings on NIAAA\u2019s three petitions, (2) Basta violated due\nprocess, OAA, and state law rights, and (3) the Hearing Rule\nis invalid under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.\n In response, Basta filed a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). That motion\nalleged that NIAAA had not shown: (A) \u201cany property right\nin an administrative hearing pursuant to due process [or] the\nOlder Americans Act\u201d; (B) a clearly established right that had\nbeen violated to defeat qualified immunity to bar Counts I\u2013V;\n(C) why sovereign immunity would not bar Counts VI\u2013X; (D)\nwhy the statute of limitations would not bar Counts III and\nIV; (E) what standing NIAAA has to bring Counts VII\u2013VIII on\nbehalf of older adults and organizations. After full briefing on\nthat motion, the district court entered an order dismissing\nNIAAA\u2019s complaint without prejudice. The order invited\nNIAAA to file an amended complaint, but NIAAA instead\nfiled a motion for entry of a final judgment. The district court\ngranted that motion, and this appeal followed.\n\nII\n\nWith those facts established, we turn to NIAAA\u2019s chal-\nlenge to the district court order granting the motion to dis-\nmiss. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim. Gociman, 41 F.4th at 881. And we may affirm a dismis-\nsal on any basis supported by the record. Thomas v. Dart, 39\nF.4th 835, 840 (7th Cir. 2022).\n Recall, the district court dismissed all of NIAAA\u2019s federal\nclaims (Counts I\u2013V) for three reasons: (1) the statute of limita-\ntions barred claims arising from the IDA\u2019s denials of\nNIAAA\u2019s Initial Petition and APS Petition; (2) NIAAA lacked\n\fNo. 23-2788 9\n\nany property interest deprived by the IDA without due pro-\ncess; and (3) the OAA provisions at issue did not clearly man-\nifest an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights en-\nforceable by NIAAA via \u00a7 1983. On appeal, NIAAA chal-\nlenges all three reasons. We review each in turn.\n\nA. Statute of Limitations\n\nAs a threshold matter, NIAAA argues that the district\ncourt improperly considered the statute of limitations when\nruling on Basta\u2019s motion to dismiss. Specifically, NIAAA\nclaims that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense\nand therefore must be raised in an answer, not a motion to\ndismiss. That is incorrect. In Talevski ex rel. Talevski, our court\ndid indeed caution that \u201cthe proper way to raise a limitations\ndefense is in the answer, as an affirmative defense.\u201d Talevski\nex rel. Talevski v. Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty., 6 F.4th\n713, 721 (7th Cir. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Health & Hosp. Corp. of\nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023) (emphasis added)\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). But in that very case, we also\nacknowledged two other ways that the defense can be raised:\n(1) in a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(c); or (2) in a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in the rare circumstance where \u201cthe\ncomplaint alone alleges enough facts to eliminate all doubt\nabout timeliness.\u201d Id. Here, there was no factual dispute as to\ntimeliness, only a legal one. The parties do not dispute when\nthe underlying facts occurred, and the timing of those events\nwas adequately alleged in the complaint. Instead, they dis-\npute whether the timing of those events meant that related\nclaims were barred as a matter of law. Thus, the district court\n\f10 No. 23-2788\n\nwas right to consider Basta\u2019s statute of limitations argument\nwhen ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n With this threshold matter settled, we consider whether\nthe statute of limitations legally barred the claims at issue\nhere. We have previously held that \u201csection 1983 claims aris-\ning in Illinois are governed by a two-year statute of limita-\ntions.\u201d Kelly v. City of Chicago, 4 F.3d 509, 511 (7th Cir. 1993).\nIn Kelly, we made three important observations: (1) courts\nlook to the personal injury laws of the state where the injury\noccurred to determine the statute of limitations in a \u00a7 1983\ncase; (2) federal law governs the accrual of claims for these\npurposes; and (3) courts apply the tolling laws of the state\nwhere the injury occurred. Id. These rules and principles\nguide us in answering two questions. We first ask when the\nclaims accrued. We then ask whether the limitations period\nwas tolled.\n As we observed in Kelly, the general standard for the ac-\ncrual question is that \u00a7 1983 claims \u201caccrue when the plaintiff\nknows or should know that his or her constitutional rights\nhave been violated.\u201d Id. (quoting Wilson v. Giesen, 956 F.2d\n738, 740 (7th Cir. 1992)). In this case, the two relevant petition\ndenials were discrete events that both occurred by September\n2019. It is difficult to imagine how NIAAA would not or\nshould not have known of the injuries it suffered as a result of\nthose denials in September 2019. And NIAAA does not pre-\nsent any support for an alternative conclusion. In its appellate\nbriefing, NIAAA does not directly challenge Basta\u2019s argu-\nment about when NIAAA\u2019s claims accrued. Thus, NIAAA\nhas waived any argument that the claims accrued after Sep-\ntember 2019. See Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v.\nMidwest Motor Express, Inc., 181 F.3d 799, 808 (7th Cir. 1999)\n\fNo. 23-2788 11\n\n(\u201cArguments not developed in any meaningful way are\nwaived.\u201d).\n NIAAA does argue, however, that its state court litigation\ntolled the limitations period. Illinois law does not support this\nargument. NIAAA points us to the Illinois continuing tort\ndoctrine, under which the limitations period is \u201ctolled\u201d for\ncontinuing violations. Despite courts occasionally using the\nword \u201ctoll\u201d when applying the doctrine, the Illinois continu-\ning tort doctrine governs only the point at which a claim ac-\ncrues. See Pitts v. City of Kankakee, Ill., 267 F.3d 592, 595 (7th\nCir. 2001) (\u201cThe continuing violation doctrine is \u2026 best char-\nacterized as a doctrine governing the accrual of a claim.\u201d); see\nalso Heard v. Sheahan, 253 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he\ncorrect characterization of the [Illinois] doctrine of continuing\nviolation is that it is a doctrine governing accrual, \u2026 not a toll-\ning doctrine[.]\u201d (citations omitted)); Powell v. City of Danville,\n625 N.E.2d 830, 831 (Ill. 1993) (\u201cThere are situations where the\ntortious conduct is continuing, and the limitations period be-\ngins on the date of the last injury (the date the tortious acts\ncease).\u201d). Thus, NIAAA has not offered, nor have we found,\nany authority to support NIAAA\u2019s position that its state court\nlitigation tolled the statute of limitations for its federal claims.\n For these reasons, we find that the relevant claims accrued\nby September 2019\u2014more than two years before NIAAA filed\nits complaint in federal court in February 2022\u2014and were not\ntolled for any period. Accordingly, we affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s ruling that NIAAA\u2019s claims \u201carising from the denials\nof the Initial Petition and the APS Petition are barred by the\nstatute of limitations.\u201d Nw. Ill. Area Agency on Aging v. Basta,\n3:22-cv-50070, 2023 WL 6057263, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 16, 2023).\n\f12 No. 23-2788\n\nB. Deprivation of Property Rights Without Due Process\n\nAlthough the statute of limitations problem is sufficient to\naffirm the dismissal of NIAAA\u2019s claims about the denial of\nthe Initial and APS Petitions, it does not support dismissal of\nthe State Plan Appeal claims. Therefore, we next consider\nwhether those claims implicate NIAAA\u2019s due process rights.\n NIAAA argues that Illinois state law establishes property\nrights enforceable under \u00a7 1983. But this is hard to square with\nthe fact that Illinois\u2019 highest court determined that Illinois\nstate law does not create such rights, at least regarding the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion. In Nyhammer, the Illinois Supreme Court considered the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion and held:\n Here, NIAAA makes no argument that it has a\n life or liberty interest in the subjects of its peti-\n tions for hearing. Thus, the only potentially ap-\n plicable interest NIAAA could have in the fund-\n ing or service provider designation for which it\n seeks a hearing from the Department is a prop-\n erty interest. However, to have a property inter-\n est, there must be more than a unilateral expec-\n tation of the funding or approval of its service\n provider designations. Rather, NIAAA must\n show a legitimate claim of entitlement to the\n funding or service provider designation for\n which it seeks a hearing.\n Applying these principles to the case at bar, we\n cannot say that NIAAA has a constitutionally\n protected property interest because NIAAA has\n\fNo. 23-2788 13\n\nnot alleged facts explaining how, under objec-\n tively ascertainable criteria set forth in the law\n that limits the Department's discretion in some\n way, it is entitled to the \u201cother funding\u201d or ser-\n vice provider designation approval that it seeks.\n215 N.E.3d at 950 (citations omitted).\n We see no reason why the denial of the hearing requested\nin NIAAA\u2019s State Plan Appeal\u2014which was not before the Il-\nlinois Supreme Court\u2014would have involved property rights\ncreated by state law where the first two denials did not. In its\nbriefing, the NIAAA notes that the third petition cited two\nagency regulations, but those would have also applied to the\nfirst two petitions, as would the Illinois Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. Thus, in accordance with the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Nyhammer, we affirm the district court\u2019s\nholding that NIAAA has failed to plausibly allege a due pro-\ncess violation. See Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Miscevic, 880 F.3d\n927, 934 (7th Cir. 2018) (\u201cWe must defer to a state court\u2019s in-\nterpretation of the state\u2019s statute.\u201d) (cleaned).\n C. The OAA & Section 1983\n\nOn the question of whether the OAA creates rights en-\nforceable under \u00a7 1983, NIAAA asks us to reach the same re-\nsult that the Supreme Court did in Health & Hospital Corp. of\nMarion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023). As we recently\nobserved, the Supreme Court in Talevski provided a twofold\ntest to analyze whether a Spending Clause statute creates a\nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Saint Anthony Hosp. v. White-\nhorn, 132 F.4th 962, 970\u201371 (7th Cir. 2025) (citing Talevski, 599\nU.S. at 180\u2013183); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl.,\n145 S. Ct. 2219, 2229\u201334 (2025) (clarifying the analysis). The\n\f14 No. 23-2788\n\nfirst part of that analysis asks whether Congress \u201cunambigu-\nously conferred individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries\nto which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183\n(cleaned). If we answer that question in the affirmative, then\nthe second part of the Talevski analysis asks whether Congress\nintended to preclude the enforcement of those individual\nrights via \u00a7 1983. Id. at 186.\n Applying that two-part approach in Talevski, the Court\nconcluded that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act\u2019s\n(FNHRA) unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice pro-\nvisions \u201cunambiguously\u201d conferred such rights to nursing\nhome residents. Id. at 184 (citing Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S.\n273, 284 (2002)). The nursing home residents cleared the first\nhurdle because the provisions at issue spoke specifically in\nterms of individual rights. Id. at 184\u201386. And the defendants\ncould not rebut the resulting presumption\u2014that is, that the\nindividual rights Congress created in the FNHRA could be\nenforced via \u00a7 1983\u2014because enforcement under \u00a7 1983 was\ncompatible with the enforcement scheme provided for in the\nFNHRA. Id. at 187\u201391.\n Here, the district court determined that the OAA differs\nfrom the FNHRA in both relevant respects. At the first step of\nthe Talevski analysis, we \u201cemploy traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Here, those tools leave\nus without the necessary conviction that the OAA provisions\nat issue in this case create individual rights enforceable by\nNIAAA. So, we need not reach the second part of the analysis.\n Starting with \u00a7 3027 of the OAA, we conclude that this pro-\nvision does not create an individual right enforceable under\n\u00a7 1983 for three reasons.\n\fNo. 23-2788 15\n\nFirst, the context of \u00a7 3027 militates against this determi-\nnation. Although the OAA speaks to older Americans\u2019 \u201centi-\ntlements\u201d generally, \u00a7 3027 was not enacted to secure those\nentitlements per se, but to regulate federal funding related to\nthose entitlements. An indicator of that purpose, for example,\nis the remedy the section provides for noncompliance. See\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981)\n(\u201c[T]he typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally\nimposed conditions is not a private cause of action for non-\ncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to\nterminate funds to the State.\u201d). Here, that remedy is the ter-\nmination of funds to non-compliant states. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3027(d) (\u201cDiscontinuance of Payments\u201d).\n Second, \u00a7 3027 does not identify area agencies specifically\nor older persons more generally as the benefited class.\nWhereas the FNHRA\u2019s relevant provisions spoke directly to\nnursing home residents\u2019 needs and welfare, \u00a7 3027 speaks\nonly in terms of the states. It deals with giving funds to states,\nwithholding those funds from states, allowing states to appeal\nfindings made by the federal government, the notice afforded\nto states, and the limitations of states\u2019 power.\n Third, no provision of \u00a7 3027 specifically confers rights to\nresidents. Although it requires detailed state plans targeted at\nspecific services, \u00a7 3027 governs neither how those services\nare to be administered nor what individual rights (if any) the\nservices are intended to secure. This differs from the FNHRA\nprovisions at issue in Talevski which required nursing homes\nto protect \u201ctransfer and discharge rights\u201d and \u201cprotect and\npromote the right to be free from any physical or chemical re-\nstraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience\nand not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\u201d\n\f16 No. 23-2788\n\nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (emphasis in original) (cleaned)\n(citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1369r(c)(2)); see also\nMedina, 145 S. Ct. at 2234 (\u201c[T]he statutes at issue in Talevski\nsupply the only reliable yardstick against which to measure\nwhether spending-power legislation confers a privately en-\nforceable right.\u201d). Indeed, there is no mention of individual\n\u201crights,\u201d \u201cprivileges,\u201d \u201cimmunities,\u201d or any similar language,\nin \u00a7 3027.\n As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, \u00a7 1983 per-\nmits plaintiffs \u201cto sue for violations of federal spending-\npower statutes only in \u2018atypical\u2019 situations \u2026.\u201d Medina, 145 S.\nCt. at 2239 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). For the three rea-\nsons discussed above, we are left unconvinced that \u00a7 3027 is\nthe sort of \u201catypical\u201d provision contemplated in Talevski.\n Turning to \u00a7 3026(f)(2) of the OAA, we see no reason to\nengage in the Talevski analysis. This is because, even if the pro-\nvision could be enforced via \u00a7 1983, NIAAA failed to state a\nclaim against Basta. Recall, NIAAA claimed that \u00a7 3026(f)(2)\nrequired the IDA to hold a hearing on the withheld funding\nat issue in the Initial Petition. Yet the defendant, Basta, played\nno role in that affair. As the district court noted, \u201cthere are no\nallegations from which it can plausibly be inferred that [Basta]\never made any decision to withhold OAA funding.\u201d Basta,\n2023 WL 6057263 at *5. In the Initial Petition, NIAAA alleged\nonly that Basta\u2019s predecessor withheld funds without first\ngranting a hearing. So, even if \u00a7 3026(f)(2) does create rights\nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u2014a question that we do not consider\ntoday\u2014NIAAA fails to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.\n\fNo. 23-2788 17\n\nHaving followed the approach set forth in Talevski, we af-\nfirm the district court\u2019s ruling that none of the relevant OAA\nprovisions create a right enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n\nIII\n\nIn conclusion, we find that the district court correctly de-\ncided the due process, \u00a7 1983, and statute of limitations issues\nNIAAA raises, and properly granted the motion to dismiss.\nBecause we affirm on those grounds, we do not reach the\nquestion of qualified immunity. See Hicks v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corr.,\n109 F.4th 895, 900 (7th Cir. 2024).\n The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED."

The clerk's judgment, upon a jury verdict, is in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the clerk's judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p>In February 2015, a livery cab operated by the plaintiff and a Walgreens tractor-trailer operated by the defendant Christopher B. Bowman collided in the westbound lanes of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in Brooklyn. The plaintiff then commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained in the accident against Bowman and the defendants Walgreen Co, Walgreens Family of Companies, and Walgreen Oshkosh, Inc. The matter proceeded to a bifurcated jury trial. The jury found that Bowman was not negligent at the time of the accident. A clerk's judgment was then entered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff dismissing the complaint. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he scope of cross-examination and the determination of the evidence which may be introduced for impeachment purposes lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed unless there was an improvident exercise of discretion\" (<i>Linker v Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6006736\"><a href=\"/opinion/6141328/linker-v-sears-roebuck-co/#613\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Linker v.

Indeed, the trial court has broad discretion in controlling the scope of direct, cross, and redirect examination (<i>see Caserta v Levittown School Dist.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5679324\"><a href=\"/opinion/5823700/caserta-v-levittown-school-district/#550\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Caserta v.

Manha\">218 AD2d 784</a></span>). Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in permitting, for impeachment purposes, defense counsel's limited cross-examination of the plaintiff's expert as to the conclusions reached by an officer who authored a police accident report regarding the accident, as the plaintiff's expert admitted to reviewing and relying on, among other things, that report in reaching his conclusions and preparing for trial.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's contention on appeal concerning summation comments made by defense counsel, who referred to the plaintiff as inattentive and/or aggressive when describing the plaintiff's actions prior to the accident, are unpreserved for appellate review (<i>see Yakubov v Gaft</i>, [*2]<span class=\"citation no-link\">231 AD3d 1099</span>, 1101; <i>Castillo v MTA Bus Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">163 AD3d 620</span>, 623). The plaintiff's counsel failed to object to these comments at trial, did not request curative instructions at the time the comments were made, and did not move for a mistrial on this ground (<i>see Yakubov v Gaft</i>, 231 AD3d at 1101; <i>Kulynska v Agayeva</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">188 AD3d 659</span>, 660).</p>\n<p>GENOVESI, J.P., MILLER, DOWLING and MCCORMACK, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

In the present case, the plaintiff broker contends that it had an exclusive agreement to secure certain financing on behalf of the defendant and that it was entitled to a commission even though it was not the procuring cause of a loan the defendant ultimately obtained. For the reasons that follow, we determine that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the transaction at issue and, therefore, we affirm the order appealed from.</p><p><i>Factual and Procedural Background</i></p>\n<p>In June 2020, the defendant, Aurora Properties, LLC, entered into an agreement with the plaintiff, Angelic Real Estate, LLC, a licensed real estate broker specializing in obtaining financing for commercial properties, for the plaintiff to secure certain financing on the defendant's behalf. The two-page letter agreement dated June 8, 2020 (hereinafter the agreement), stated that the defendant was engaging the plaintiff \"exclusively\" to obtain debt financing for multiple office buildings located in Tennessee. Under the \"scope\" provision of the agreement, the plaintiff was to \"assist [the defendant] in identifying, soliciting proposals from, and negotiating with financing providers for debt for the Properties.\" The scope provision set forth the terms of the defendant's desired loan and further provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p>\"[I]f under this Agreement [the plaintiff] does not secure, on or before June 20, 2020, one or more written quotes or terms sheets from lenders [with the desired terms], this Agreement shall remain in place but shall become non-exclusive with regards to any lenders not already approached and engaged by [the plaintiff]. In such instance, [the plaintiff] shall provide [the defendant] a list of its protected lenders it has gone to for the Properties . . . by the end of the next business day. Should [the plaintiff] subsequent to that date secure such terms with a lender on the [list], or with another [*2]lender who has not already provided a terms sheet to [the defendant], either directly or via another intermediary, the exclusivity clause of this Agreement shall be reinstated.\"</p>\n<p>The term of the agreement was 120 days from June 8, 2020. Pursuant to the agreement, if the defendant came to an agreement on terms for financing, the plaintiff was to be paid a fee at the closing of each funding pursuant to a specified fee scale. The agreement also contained an \"Exclusion\" provision, which stated that the above-referenced fee would not apply to a loan with three specified lenders, including Mountain Commerce Bank (hereinafter MCB), \"provided a terms sheet is signed with one of them on or before June 30, 2020.\"</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2020, the defendant obtained a $16,750,000 loan commitment from MCB. The plaintiff allegedly informed the defendant that if MCB entered into a terms sheet before the expiration of the agreement and after the exclusion period, i.e., June 30, 2020, the plaintiff would be entitled to a fee under the agreement. The defendant subsequently closed on the loan with MCB and did not tender a fee to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>In November 2020, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover the fee allegedly due under the agreement. The plaintiff subsequently moved for summary judgment on the complaint. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that the terms of the agreement were clear and unambiguous and granted the plaintiff the exclusive right to secure debt financing on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff argued that since the agreement was exclusive, it was entitled to a fee as long as the defendant obtained financing during the life of the agreement, regardless of whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the financing. The plaintiff further argued that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB outlined in the agreement, that exclusion period expired on June 30, 2020, nearly two months before the defendant entered into a terms sheet with MCB.</p>\n<p>The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendant contended, among other things, that the agreement contained no clear and express language that a fee was owed regardless of the defendant independently negotiating its own terms. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff therefore was not entitled to a fee in connection with the defendant's loan from MCB, as there was no dispute the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of that loan.</p>\n<p>In an order dated October 11, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's motion and granted the defendant's cross-motion. The court determined, inter alia, that notwithstanding the fact the agreement's exclusion provision expired on June 30, 2020, given the lack of clear exclusivity in the agreement, the plaintiff was not entitled to receive a fee for a loan negotiated and secured solely by the defendant.</p>\n<p>This appeal by the plaintiff ensued.</p><p><i>Legal Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues on appeal, as it did before the Supreme Court, that it is entitled to a fee in connection with the MCB transaction because the agreement with the defendant was exclusive, and a broker is entitled to a commission under an exclusive agreement if a sales transaction occurs during the life of an agreement, whether or not the broker was the procuring cause of the transaction. The plaintiff further argues that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB, the plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to a fee because the loan commitment was obtained from MCB after the end of the exclusion period and before the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement, i.e., October 6, 2020.</p>\n<p>Generally, \"[t]o prevail on a cause of action to recover a commission, the broker must establish (1) that it is duly licensed, (2) that it had a contract, express or implied, with the party to be charged with paying the commission, and (3) that it was the procuring cause of the sale\" (<i>All Is. Estates Realty Corp. v Singh</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 1392</span>, 1392 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Blooming Home Realty, LLC v Infinity Holdings Northeast, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 AD3d 815</span>, 816). Thus, a broker seeking to recover a commission is normally required to make a showing that it was the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 AD3d 793</span>, 797 [involving a real estate brokerage agreement]; <i>Saunders Ventures, Inc. v Catcove Group, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">209 AD3d 893</span>, 896 [same]; <i>Multiloan Mtge.

Asian Gardens Ltd.\">303 AD2d 658, 660</a></span> [involving a mortgage brokerage agreement]). However, there is a distinction between brokerage agreements granting an exclusive agency and those conferring an exclusive right to sell, the latter of which permits a broker to recover a commission even if it was not the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#534\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 536</a></span>). In general, pursuant to an exclusive agency agreement, if the owner finds its own buyer, then no commission is due to the broker (<i>see U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v Hanna</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5989996\"><a href=\"/opinion/6124908/us-no-1-laffey-real-estate-v-hann/#553\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v.

Sanitary Disposal, Inc.\">120 AD2d 915, 916</a></span>). In other words, \"[w]here a broker has been granted an 'exclusive agency,' the seller cannot 'employ another broker,' but 'would not be precluded from itself making the sale without becoming liable to [the broker] for a commission'\" (<i>New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, 216 AD3d at 798, quoting <i>Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v Servinational, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5797685\"><a href=\"/opinion/5939275/hammond-kennedy-co-v-servinational-inc/#397\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v. Servinational, Inc.\">48 AD2d 394, 397</a></span>). In contrast, if a broker has been granted an exclusive right to sell, the broker would be entitled to a commission even if the owner were solely responsible for the sale (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5797685\"><a href=\"/opinion/5939275/hammond-kennedy-co-v-servinational-inc/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v.

Servinational, Inc.\">48 AD2d at 397</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Agreements have been construed as conferring an exclusive right to sell in instances where there was clear and express language providing that a commission was owed regardless of whether the broker was the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see J.E. Horan Duffy Realty v Brighton</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5990990\"><a href=\"/opinion/6125885/je-horan-duffy-realty-inc-v-brighton/#359\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: J.E.

Servinational, Inc.\">48 AD2d at 396-397</a></span>), or all inquiries or offers were required to be referred to the broker (<i>see Audrey Balog Realty Corp. v East Coast Real Estate Devs.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5972804\"><a href=\"/opinion/6108065/audrey-balog-realty-corp-v-east-coast-real-estate-developers-inc/#530\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Audrey Balog Realty Corp. v.

East Coast Real Estate...\">202 AD2d at 530</a></span> [internal quotation marks omitted]), it was held that a real estate brokerage agreement granted the plaintiff broker an exclusive right to sell because it required the defendant to \"refer all inquiries or offers\" on the subject condominium units to the attention of the plaintiff, and specified that commissions payable under the agreement would be due and payable \"regardless of whether [the plaintiff] has actually procured the Purchase Agreement.\" Consequently, the plaintiff was \"entitled to commissions on all sales procured prior to the termination of the agreement, regardless of whether or not the [plaintiff] put in any effort at all in procuring the sales\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5972804\"><a href=\"/opinion/6108065/audrey-balog-realty-corp-v-east-coast-real-estate-developers-inc/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Audrey Balog Realty Corp. v.

UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 535</a></span> [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]), the Court of Appeals held that \"a contract giving rise to an exclusive right of sale must clearly and expressly provide that a commission is due upon sale by the owner or exclude the owner from independently negotiating a sale.\" The Court of Appeals explained that \"[r]equiring an affirmative and unequivocal statement to establish a broker's exclusive right to sell is consistent with the general principle that an owner's freedom to dispose of her own property should not be infringed upon by mere implication\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). In that case, the plaintiff broker had entered into a financial brokerage agreement with the defendant, which the plaintiff conceded lacked a provision expressly conferring an exclusive right of sale (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The plaintiff argued that, despite the absence of such provision, the court should \"examine the contract as a whole to deduce the parties' intent to create an exclusive right to sell or, if the agreement is ambiguous, to examine parol evidence\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The Court of Appeals rejected that approach \"in favor of a rule that, '[w]ithout an unequivocal expression of intent by its own terms or by necessary implication from its terms, the . . . contract is at most considered to create an exclusive agency, not excluding the owner's inherent right to sell his or her own property'\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>, quoting 11 NY Jur 2d, Brokers \u00a7 169).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i> also made clear that the rule requiring a clear statement to confer an exclusive right of sale is not limited to real estate [*4]brokerage agreements. In rejecting the plaintiff's argument seeking to apply such a limitation, the Court of Appeals stated that it saw \"no reason to apply a different rule to brokerage contracts concerning the sale of financial instruments in the investment banking context,\" noting that, \"[i]n both cases, the governing principles arise from the law of agency and contract, not from the law of real property\" (<i>id.</i> at 536).</p>\n<p>The same reasoning has been applied in the context of brokerage agreements to secure financing. For example, in <i>Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i> (<span class=\"citation no-link\">197 AD3d 1057</span>, 1058), the defendant Crosswing Holdings, LLC (hereinafter Crosswing), retained the plaintiff Silvergrove Advisors, LLC (hereinafter Silvergrove), to assist it in obtaining financing. Crosswing obtained an interim bridge loan during the life of the agreement, and Silvergrove contended that it was entitled to a success fee for the bridge loan even though it had not been involved in that transaction (<i>see <span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>). The Appellate Division, First Department, in pertinent part, upheld the determination denying that branch of Silvergrove's motion which was for summary judgment in connection with recovering that success fee, noting that \"the contractual language plainly states that Silvergrove was not given an exclusive right of sale, but was simply made defendants' exclusive broker\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>, citing <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

Ward\">68 AD3d 1213, 1215</a></span>), certain defendants had entered into an agreement to obtain financing for a hotel project with a licensed real estate salesperson associated with the plaintiff, which set forth a period of exclusivity during which time the salesperson was entitled to a commission, regardless of whether he or another party procured the financing commitment. Given this language, the Appellate Division, Third Department, held that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of liability on his cause of action to recover a commission pursuant to that agreement even though the parties disputed the extent to which the salesperson was involved in the negotiation of the loan (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v.

Initially, it is undisputed that the plaintiff did not secure a lender or loan with conforming terms on behalf of the defendant before June 20, 2020. Further, the defendant demonstrated that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the loan the defendant independently obtained from MCB in August 2020. The agreement did not clearly and expressly provide the plaintiff with the exclusive right to deal or negotiate on the defendant's behalf (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from the trial court\u2019s order designating her a\n\nvexatious litigant and denying her statement of inability to pay costs. The appellee who\n\nfiled the motion is Nicholas Denbrock, the father of Andrews\u2019s daughter. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arises from a modification suit Andrews filed pro se on December 18,\n\n2024\u2014just three weeks after the trial court rendered a final order in another modification\n\nsuit on November 26, 2024.2 Over the next two months, Andrews filed sixteen additional\n\nmotions and pleadings. These included multiple emergency motions, amended petitions,\n\nmotions to reconsider, motions to stay, and notices claiming constitutional violations.\n\nAndrews also requested electronic access to the child, moved to declare Denbrock a\n\nvexatious litigant, filed special appearances challenging jurisdiction, and demanded\n\n\u201cimmediate return of child.\u201d\n\nAndrews filed a declaration of inability to pay costs, claiming $0 monthly income,\n\n$8,165 in monthly expenses, $1,800 in assets, and $118,500 in debt.\n\nDenbrock moved to declare Andrews a vexatious litigant based on her numerous\n\nfilings. At the hearing, the trial court asked Andrews to provide documentation supporting\n\nher inability to pay. Andrews initially claimed she received no notice, then stated the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over her. When pressed again, Andrews objected and continued\n\nasserting the court lacked personal jurisdiction.\n\nThe trial court found that Andrews refused to present proof of her financial records\n\nand ordered her to pay court costs. The court granted Denbrock\u2019s vexatious litigant\n\nmotion and required Andrews to post a security bond or face dismissal with prejudice of\n\nher pending motions. The order prohibits Andrews from filing new pleadings for\n\n2 Andrews\u2019s appeal from that decision is In the Interest of E.K.D., No. 07-24-00342-CV, also\nresolved this day.\n\faffirmative relief as a pro se litigant without first obtaining permission from the local\n\nadministrative judge. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.102(a). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI. Jurisdiction\n\nDenbrock contends this Court lacks jurisdiction because the vexatious litigant\n\norder is not final. However, the Third Court of Appeals has held that interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom prefiling orders designating a person as a vexatious litigant are permissible.\n\nSerafine v. Crump, 665 S.W.3d 93, 102 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2023), rev\u2019d on other grounds,\n\n691 S.W.3d 917 (Tex. 2024). Principles of horizontal stare decisis require this Court to\n\nfollow the authority of the Third Court as if we were sitting as that court. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 41.3; Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645 S.W.3d 251, 258 (Tex. 2022). We therefore exercise\n\njurisdiction over Andrews\u2019s appeal.\n\nII. Vexatious Litigant Designation\n\nChapter 11 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code establishes procedures\n\nfor designating vexatious litigants. A court may designate a plaintiff as vexatious if the\n\nplaintiff has either: (1) commenced, prosecuted, or maintained five litigations as a pro se\n\nlitigant in seven years with additional necessary findings; or (2) after a litigation has been\n\nfinally determined against the plaintiff, repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate the\n\nsame issues against the same defendant. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.054(1),\n\n(2).\n\f We review the court\u2019s vexatious litigant determination for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSerafine, 665 S.W.3d at 105. Constitutional claims are reviewed de novo. Fontenot v.\n\nFontenot, 667 S.W.3d 894, 911 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2023, no pet.).\n\nA. Fundamental Parental Rights\n\nAndrews argues the vexatious litigant designation violates her fundamental\n\nparental rights by preventing her from filing motions to protect her child. We addressed\n\nthis argument in Byars v. Evans, concluding that requiring a parent to seek permission\n\nfrom the local administrative judge before filing affirmative pleadings does not violate due\n\nprocess because it is not an absolute denial of parental rights. No. 07-14-00064-CV,\n\n2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 201, at *12\u201314 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Jan. 8, 2016, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). Although the Third Court has not precisely addressed this issue, it has generally\n\nrecognized that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate due process. Caldwell v.\n\nZimmerman, No. 03-18-00168-CV, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Mar. 27, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nAndrews argues that because attorneys have absolute immunity for actions\n\nundertaken while representing clients, parents appearing pro se should have similar\n\nimmunity when acting in their child\u2019s best interest. This argument fails for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the prefiling order does not prohibit Andrews from filing\u2014it requires her to obtain\n\npermission from the local administrative judge before filing new pleadings for affirmative\n\nrelief. Second, Andrews misunderstands attorney immunity. Attorney immunity protects\n\nagainst civil liability to third parties, not against court authority over attorneys. Bethel v.\n\nQuilling, Selander, Lownds, Winslett & Moser, P.C., 595 S.W.3d 651, 657 (Tex. 2020)\n\f(\u201cWe have long recognized . . . that attorney immunity is not boundless.\u201d). Courts retain\n\nfull authority to sanction, hold in contempt, or discipline attorneys for inappropriate\n\nconduct. Brewer v. Lennox Hearth Products, LLC, 601 S.W.3d 704, 718 (Tex. 2020) (\u201cA\n\ncourt\u2019s inherent authority includes the power to discipline an attorney\u2019s behavior.\u201d)\n\n(cleaned up).\n\nAndrews\u2019s first issue is overruled.\n\nFirst Amendment Right to Petition\n\nAndrews\u2019s entire second issue is stated as: \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the\n\nright to petition courts for redress (BE & K Construction Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516\n\n(2002)).\u201d This issue is insufficiently briefed. Nevertheless, the Third Court has previously\n\nheld that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate the First Amendment right to\n\npetition. Caldwell, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136.\n\nAndrews\u2019s second issue is overruled.\n\nStatutory Requirements\n\nBy her third issue, Andrews argues she is not a \u201cplaintiff\u201d under the statute and did\n\nnot file five frivolous cases in seven years. The statute defines \u201cplaintiff\u201d as \u201can individual\n\nwho commences or maintains a litigation pro se.\u201d TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 11.001(5) (emphasis added). Andrews meets both definitions: she commenced a\n\nmodification proceeding, and she maintained litigation through repeated motions to\n\nreconsider, stay enforcement, or declare orders void.\n\f Andrews\u2019s challenge is focused on only one basis for the vexatious litigant\n\nfinding\u2014five frivolous cases in seven years; she ignores the alternative basis that she\n\nrepeatedly attempted to relitigate matters finally determined against her. See id.\n\n\u00a7 11.054(1), (2). In her reply brief, Andrews summarily argues there was no competent\n\nevidence supporting this finding. However, arguments may not be raised for the first time\n\nin a reply brief. See McFadden v. Olesky, 517 S.W.3d 287, 293 n.3 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin\n\n2017, pet. denied).\n\nAndrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nInability to Pay\n\nBy her fourth issue, Andrews argues the trial court erred by denying her statement\n\nof inability to pay costs and failing to enter findings of fact. Andrews contends her affidavit\n\nconclusively established her inability to pay and was not contradicted by other evidence.\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 permits a party to file a sworn statement of\n\ninability to afford court costs. When the statement is contested, the trial court may require\n\nthe declarant to prove inability to pay at an evidentiary hearing with at least ten days of\n\nnotice. TEX. R. CIV. P. 145. At the hearing, \u201cthe burden is on the declarant to prove the\n\ninability to afford costs.\u201d Id.\n\nThe test for indigence is whether the record shows \u201cby a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the applicant would be unable to pay the costs . . . if [s]he really wanted to\n\nand made a good-faith effort to do so.\u201d Higgins v. Randall Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Off., 257 S.W.3d\n\n684, 686 (Tex. 2008) (cleaned up). We review for an abuse of discretion. Henderson v.\n\fArabzadegan, No. 03-24-00313-CV, 2024 Tex. App. LEXIS 5919, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Aug. 16, 2024, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nThe trial court provided Andrews with notice and asked her to bring documentation\n\nsupporting her indigency affidavit. Andrews refused to provide any documentation,\n\ninstead repeatedly asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction. Andrews\u2019s affidavit also\n\ncontained contradictory information: she claimed $0 monthly income and only $1,800 in\n\nassets while reporting $8,000 in monthly expenses. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in requiring Andrews to pay court costs.\n\nAndrews also complains the trial court failed to make findings of fact mandated by\n\nRule 145. See id. R. 145(f)(2). However, the trial court issued its findings seven days\n\nafter Andrews filed her brief, and she made no request to supplement her brief. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.7.\n\nAndrews also makes a conclusory argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling violates the\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. This argument consists of a\n\nsingle quote from a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Missing from the argument is any\n\nanalysis of how the trial court\u2019s ruling, or requiring her to pay court costs, violates her\n\nrights. Accordingly, this argument is waived for inadequate briefing. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex. 2018).\n\nAndrews\u2019s fourth issue is overruled.3\n\n3 In a fifth issue, Andrews challenges what she calls the trial court\u2019s \u201cflawed rulings.\u201d Her argument\ncontains no citations to the record, applicable law, or authority. Andrews fails to identify which specific\nruling she challenges, what relief she seeks, or how any relief could be granted. This issue is waived for\ninadequate briefing. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex.\n\f CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all of Andrews\u2019s issues, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n2018) (\u201cA brief must provide citations or argument and analysis for the contentions and failure to do this\ncan result in waiver.\u201d).\n\n8"

Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from a final order in a suit affecting the parent-\n\nchild relationship regarding her child, E.K.D., with Appellee Nicholas Denbrock. Andrews\n\nraises three issues: (1) the trial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised\n\nvisitation; (2) the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption favoring a standard\n\npossession order; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in determining her net\n\nresources for child support were subject to the maximum amount. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case began with two registered foreign orders from Nevada that gave the\n\nparties \u201cjoint legal custody,\u201d a week-on/week-off possession schedule, and a mutual\n\nbehavior order. Denbrock filed suit to modify the Nevada order in Texas, requesting that\n\nhe have the exclusive right to designate the child\u2019s residence and to make all medical and\n\neducational decisions concerning the child. Andrews counterpetitioned for similar relief.\n\nThe matter was tried to the bench over four trial days across six months. The trial\n\ncourt appointed both parties as joint managing conservators but awarded Denbrock\n\nexclusive rights including the right to designate the child\u2019s residence. Andrews received\n\nonly supervised visitation and was ordered to pay $1,500 monthly in child support.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPossession and Access\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s supervised visitation order in her first two\n\nissues. We review a trial court\u2019s modification of conservatorship or possession for an\n\nabuse of discretion. In re J.A.J., 243 S.W.3d 611, 616 (Tex. 2007). \u201cThe best interest of\n\nthe child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues\n\nof conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d\n\n211, 218 (Tex. 2021) (quoting TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.002). Conservatorship suits\n\nare \u201cintensely fact driven.\u201d Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 19 (Tex. 2002). For this reason,\n\n\u201cthe trial court is in the best position to \u2018observe the demeanor and personalities of the\n\nwitnesses and can \u201cfeel\u201d the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by\n\nmerely reading the record.\u2019\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting Echols v. Olivarez,\n\f85 S.W.3d 475, 477 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2002, no pet.)). The factfinder \u201cis the sole judge\n\nof the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d Golden Eagle\n\nArchery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion by acting \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principles\u201d or arbitrarily or unreasonably. In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting\n\nWorford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam)). A trial court also\n\nabuses its discretion \u201cif it imposes restrictions that exceed those required to protect the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest.\u201d In re H.D.C., 474 S.W.3d 758, 764 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2014, no pet.); see also In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218\u201319.\n\nUnder this standard, challenges to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nare not independent grounds of error but instead are factors used to assess whether the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion. Zeifman v. Michels, 212 S.W.3d 582, 587 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin 2006, pet. denied). An appellate court considers (1) whether the trial court had\n\nsufficient information on which to exercise its discretion and (2) whether the trial court\n\nerred in its application of discretion. Id. at 588. A trial court does not abuse its discretion\n\nif there is some substantive, probative evidence to support its decision. Id. at 587.\n\nAndrews argues that under the Holley and Family Code\u2019s best-interest factors, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised visits. She also challenges the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a standard possession\n\norder. See Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976);2 TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.\n\n2 The Holley factors include: (1) the desires of the child; (2) the emotional and physical needs of\n\nthe child now and in the future; (3) the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future;\n(4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (5) the programs available to assist these\nindividuals to promote the best interest of the child; (6) the plans for the child by the individuals seeking\n\f\u00a7 153.134(a).3 Andrews contends the trial court based its ruling on a \u201cmere failure to\n\nfollow a court order\u201d rather than the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe trial court found Andrews violated court orders approximately two dozen times.\n\nSome violations were relatively minor, such as failing to provide her new address in a\n\ntimely manner. Other violations were more significant, including going out of state,\n\nrefusing to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s periods of possession, and making\n\ndemeaning remarks about Denbrock during electronic communications with the child.\n\nThe trial court also found that Andrews had refused to identify herself at a hearing and\n\nsent ex parte communications to the trial court through social media. Additionally,\n\nAndrews tried to remove the child from Denbrock\u2019s car without permission during what\n\nwas supposed to be supervised visitation. Andrews does not challenge any of these\n\nfindings, and the evidence supports them.\n\nAdditional evidence at trial included various filings by Andrews, including a \u201cWrit of\n\nDivinia,\u201d and a notice that Andrews placed the child into a trust. Andrews testified she\n\ncustody; (7) the stability of the home or proposed placement; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent which\nmay indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and (9) any excuse for the acts\nor omissions of the parent. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976).\n 3 The statutory best-interest factors include:\n\n(1) whether the physical, psychological, or emotional needs and development of the child\n will benefit from the appointment of joint managing conservators; (2) the ability of the\n parents to give first priority to the welfare of the child and reach shared decisions in the\n child\u2019s best interest; (3) whether each parent can encourage and accept a positive\n relationship between the child and the other parent; (4) whether both parents participated\n in child rearing before the filing of the suit; (5) the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019\n residences; (6) if the child is 12 years of age or older, the child\u2019s preference, if any,\n regarding the person to have the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the\n child; and (7) any other relevant factor.\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a).\n\fagrees to follow court orders \u201cwhen it\u2019s in the best interest of [the child].\u201d She indicated\n\nthat she believed the original Nevada order violated due process and was illegal, which\n\nis why she did not believe she needed to follow it.\n\nThe Holley and statutory best-interest factors are neither exhaustive nor\n\ndeterminative. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a)(7) (permitting a trial court to\n\nconsider any other relevant factors); In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 27 (Tex. 2002) (the Holley\n\nfactors are not exhaustive and some cases may not have evidence of some factors at\n\nall). Courts have considered a parent\u2019s conduct that interferes with the other parent\u2019s\n\nrelationship with their child. See Allen v. Allen, 475 S.W.3d 453, 458 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.); In re Marriage of Chandler, 914 S.W.2d 252, 255 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAmarillo 1996, no writ).\n\nThe record contains significant testimony and evidence that Andrews interfered\n\nwith Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child. The evidence reveals that Andrews:\n\n\u2022 Sometimes refused to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s\n scheduled possession periods;\n\n\u2022 Made negative comments about Denbrock to the child and called\n Denbrock and his family \u201cdemons,\u201d \u201cpsychos,\u201d and \u201cevil monkeys\u201d;\n\n\u2022 Exhibited suicidal ideation and paranoid beliefs about being followed\n and monitored;\n\n\u2022 Engaged in \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d by seeking treatment from multiple\n physicians until receiving preferred responses, often without\n consulting Denbrock;\n\n\u2022 After temporary orders gave Denbrock medical decision-making\n authority, cancelled the child\u2019s four-year check-up and dental\n appointments; and\n\f \u2022 Attempted to open Denbrock\u2019s car doors to obtain the child when no\n supervisor was present, which severely upset the child.\n\nAlthough some of the Holley and statutory best-interest factors could have\n\nsupported a different outcome, that does not mean that the trial court\u2019s order constitutes\n\nan abuse of discretion. The trial court considered Andrews\u2019s extensive history of\n\ninterfering with Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child, as well as his efforts to obtain\n\nproper healthcare for the child, and Andrews\u2019s position regarding following court orders\n\nthat she deems not to be in the child\u2019s best interest. On this record, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by limiting Andrews\u2019s periods of possession and\n\naccess and requiring them to be supervised. Andrews\u2019s first and second issues are\n\noverruled.\n\nChild Support\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that her net monthly resources\n\nwere $9,200\u2014the statutory maximum\u2014resulting in a $1,500 monthly support obligation.\n\nChild support determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, with legal\n\nand factual sufficiency serving as relevant factors rather than independent grounds for\n\nreversal. Banakar v. Krause, 674 S.W.3d 564, 573 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2023,\n\nno pet.). Net resources include income from various sources, including trust income and\n\n\u201call other income actually received.\u201d TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 154.062(b). Trial courts may\n\ncalculate net resources based on imprecise information, particularly when a party fails to\n\nprovide required documentation. In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d 660, 666 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso\n\n2011, no pet.).\n\f Andrews challenges the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that she made\n\n$20,000 in monthly income. Andrews testified that she receives income from her father\u2019s\n\nbusiness that takes in $20,000 to $30,000 monthly, though she claimed her father pays\n\nher only $2,000 to $4,000 monthly \u201cfor the extra stuff.\u201d Notably, though, Andrews refused\n\nto provide trust documents, bank records, or other financial information despite discovery\n\nrequests and a court order compelling production.\n\nHowever, the trial court could also assess Andrews\u2019s credibility regarding her\n\nincome through the other evidence of her expenses: she reported approximately $7,000\n\nin monthly expenses for rent, car payments, and therapy alone\u2014well beyond the $2,000\n\nto $4,000 she claimed to receive. The trial court was free to disbelieve Andrews\u2019s\n\ntestimony regarding her income. See In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d at 666. Moreover, any error\n\nthat the trial court could have made would be the fault of Andrews by contumaciously\n\nrefusing to provide the necessary information to appropriately set child support, despite\n\ndiscovery requests and an order to compel. Accordingly, we conclude that there was at\n\nleast some evidence of a probative and substantive character supporting the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision and determine that the trial court made a reasonable decision based on that\n\nevidence. See Banakar, 674 S.W.3d at 573. Andrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n7"

See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\n2 TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1),(b)(2)(A), (B). Appellant pleaded true to the enhancement\n\nand habitual offender provisions. The range of punishment applicable to Appellant was enhanced to a term\nof confinement of \u201clife, or for any term of not more than 99 years or less than 25 years.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE\nANN. \u00a7 12.42(d).\n\fjury assessed a punishment of 40 years of confinement for each conviction. The trial\n\ncourt sentenced Appellant accordingly and ordered the sentences run concurrently. We\n\noverrule Appellant\u2019s two issues and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAppellant and the complainant, Marisa Espinoza, had been in an on-and-off\n\nromantic relationship since 1996. They have two children together, ages 29 and 11.\n\nEspinoza testified they had conducted a marriage ceremony but never filed official\n\npaperwork, and she would introduce Appellant as both her boyfriend or husband. At the\n\ntime of the charged offense, Appellant had been living with Espinoza for about eight\n\nmonths after being released from custody in January 2022.\n\nOn September 9, 2022, Appellant and Espinoza had been arguing all day. The\n\nargument intensified after Appellant took Espinoza\u2019s truck and was gone longer than\n\nexpected, which angered Espinoza. She began \u201cblowing up his phone\u201d;3 he would not\n\nanswer her calls. When Appellant returned, the discussion escalated, with Appellant\n\ncalling Espinoza names and then engaging in physical violence.\n\nAppellant grabbed Espinoza by her hair and pulled her inside the house. Once\n\ninside the kitchen and dining room area, Appellant struck her in the face and head area\n\nwith his hands. Espinoza testified he hit her \u201cat least three times\u201d with a closed fist.\n\nAppellant also grabbed Espinoza by the throat with his left hand, applying pressure with\n\na force that caused her to feel she \u201cwas being suffocated. Like . . . they\u2019re cutting off your\n\n3 This is a colloquial expression meaning repeatedly calling or texting someone, often in an urgent\n\nor persistent manner. See, e.g., K\u2019ron, Round of Applause, (Atlantic Records 2020). (\u201cShe blowin\u2019 up my\nphone / Won\u2019t leave me alone / She get on my nerves / Where would I be without her?\u201d).\n\fairway.\u201d Meanwhile, Appellant told Espinoza \u201che hates [her], he\u2019s going to kill [her], stuff\n\nlike that.\u201d Espinoza had difficulty breathing, was \u201cscared,\u201d and needed \u201cto get help.\u201d\n\nWhen Espinoza\u2019s brother walked into the room, Appellant released his grip.\n\nEspinoza immediately ran to the front door and called 911. Espinoza\u2019s voice was\n\nnoticeably raspy as she tried to catch her breath. Police officers responding to the scene\n\nobserved visible injuries on Espinoza\u2019s neck, photographed the injuries, and arrested\n\nAppellant for assault by strangulation.\n\nTwo days later, Appellant telephoned Espinoza from jail and told her to instruct\n\nprosecutors to drop the charges. During this call, he admitted he grabbed her by the\n\n\u201cpescuezo,\u201d the Spanish word for \u201cneck.\u201d\n\nANALYSIS\n\nFirst Issue: Double Jeopardy\n\nAppellant argues his convictions for both assault family violence by occlusion and\n\nassault family violence with a prior conviction constitute multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. He\n\nacknowledges the remedy for the alleged violation would be to \u201cretain the conviction with\n\nthe most serious punishment and vacate any remaining convictions\u201d that violate double\n\njeopardy. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent 40-year terms of imprisonment for both\n\nconvictions.\n\f(a) Preservation of Error\n\nThe State argues Appellant failed to preserve this issue. But a double-jeopardy\n\nclaim may be raised for the first time on appeal when (1) the undisputed facts show the\n\nviolation is clearly apparent on the record\u2019s face, and (2) enforcement of procedural\n\ndefault serves no legitimate state interest. Langs v. State, 183 S.W.3d 680, 687 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2006).\n\nWe hold these conditions are met. A claim is apparent on the face of the record if\n\nits resolution does not require additional proceedings to introduce more evidence. Ex\n\nparte Denton, 399 S.W.3d 540, 544 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy\n\nclaim does not require additional proceedings. Moreover, the State presents no\n\npersuasive argument why enforcing procedural default serves any legitimate state\n\ninterest under these circumstances. See Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889, 892 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d); Anderson v. State, No. 10-01-00306-CV, 2003 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 6008, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco July 2, 2003, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n(b) Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\nBrown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977); Ramos v. State, 636 S.W.3d 646, 651 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021). Multiple-punishment violations occur when the same conduct is\n\npunished under distinct statutes where the Legislature intended punishment only once.\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nHere, Appellant contends that the Legislature intended only one punishment,\n\narguing section 22.01(a) is the lesser-included offense of section 22.01(b)(2)(B)\n\f(impeding normal breathing or circulation), which is merely an enhancement of the same\n\ncriminal conduct. \u201cA multiple-punishments violation can arise either in the context of\n\nlesser-included offenses, where the same conduct is punished under a greater and a\n\nlesser-included offense, and when the same conduct is punished under two distinct\n\nstatutes where the Legislature only intended for the conduct to be punished once.\u201d\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nAccordingly, we look to the statute\u2019s text to determine legislative intent. Stevenson,\n\n499 S.W.3d at 850. It is undisputed that occlusion assault (Count I) and assault family\n\nviolence with a prior (Count II) have different elements and that the State proved these\n\nelements at trial. Occlusion assault requires the State prove that a defendant impeded\n\nthe normal breathing or blood circulation of the complainant, while this element is not\n\nrequired for assault family violence with a prior conviction.\n\nThis distinction is of critical importance. In Ortiz v. State, 623 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021), the Court of Criminal Appeals addressed whether bodily-injury assault\n\ncan be a lesser-included offense of occlusion assault and answered \u201cNo.\u201d The Court\n\nemployed an \u201callowable unit of prosecution\u201d analysis to examine what facts are required\n\nto prove each offense. Occlusion assault requires proof of a specific injury\u2014\u201cimpeding\n\nnormal breathing or circulation of the blood\u201d\u2014whereas simple assault requires proof of\n\nany \u201cbodily injury,\u201d broadly defined as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical\n\ncondition.\u201d Id. at 806\u201307. While impeding breathing constitutes bodily injury, it is a distinct\n\ntype that excludes other injuries. The Court illustrated this principle with an analogy:\n\nImpeding is exclusive of other injuries in the same way that a square is\n exclusive of other rectangles: A square is a rectangle, but other rectangles\n\f are not squares; specifying \u201csquare\u201d excludes non-square rectangles; and\n specifying \u201cimpeding\u201d excludes non-impeding injuries.\n\nFor example, if a defendant were charged with occlusion assault, and the\n evidence showed that he stomped on the complainant\u2019s foot and caused\n pain, that assault would not be included in the charged offense because a\n non-impeding injury is not required to prove occlusion assault.\n\nId. at 807. The Court explained that even a non-impeding injury inflicted on the neck\n\nwould not be proven by the same facts needed to prove occlusion assault. If pinching the\n\nneck caused pain but did not impede normal breathing or blood circulation, the assault\n\nwould not be included because the assault by pinching would require proof of a different\n\ninjury than impeding.\n\nThe facts in this appeal are very similar to those in Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Brown involved a defendant who committed both\n\nstrangulation and other assaultive acts against his intimate partner during the same\n\nepisode. The defendant was convicted of both occlusion assault of a household/family\n\nmember and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe Tenth Court of Appeals relied on Ortiz\u2019s methodology to hold that convictions\n\nfor both offenses from the same incident did not violate double jeopardy. Using unit-of-\n\nprosecution analysis, the court determined that both result-oriented offenses have distinct\n\ngravamina: impeding is the focus of occlusion assault and defines its allowable unit of\n\nprosecution while excluding other injuries, whereas bodily-injury assault lacks a statutorily\n\nspecified injury. Id. at 893. The court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in\n\noccluding the complainant\u2019s breathing or blood circulation were separate from other\n\nassaultive acts he committed against her . . . [even] [t]hough the offenses may have\n\foccurred during the same criminal episode . . . .\u201d Id. at 894. Therefore, the court reasoned\n\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. Id. at 893\u201394.\n\nAppellant argues that Brown\u2019s \u201cconclusions are incorrect and both offenses are\n\nsubject to double jeopardy protection.\u201d But as a transferee court from the Tenth Court of\n\nAppeals, we are required to follow Brown\u2019s holding, as that constitutes binding precedent\n\non that court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3; Baker v. State, No. 07-22-00286-CR, 2023 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 5857, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Aug. 7, 2023, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cTexas courts follow\n\nvertical stare decisis (lower courts must follow the precedents of all higher courts) and\n\nhorizontal stare decisis (three-judge panels must follow materially indistinguishable\n\ndecisions of earlier panels of the same court unless a higher authority has superseded\n\nthat prior decision).\u201d Earl v. State, No. 03-23-00427-CR, 2025 Tex. App. LEXIS 4527, at\n\n*9\u201310 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin June 27, 2025, no pet. h.) (citing Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645\n\nS.W.3d 251, 256 (Tex. 2022)).\n\n(c) Application to this Case\n\nThese binding decisions establish a clear rule: Espinoza\u2019s injury from occlusion\n\nassault was not merely different in degree from other assault injuries she received\u2014it\n\nwas different in kind. Ortiz, 623 S.W.3d at 809; see also McCall v. State, 635 S.W.3d 261,\n\n268 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Though Appellant\u2019s offenses occurred during\n\nthe same criminal episode, they are not the same offense for Double Jeopardy purposes\n\nbecause they involve different statutorily-specified injuries requiring proof of different\n\nfacts. Brown, 640 S.W.3d at 894.\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\fSecond Issue: Evidence of Prior Domestic Violence\n\nIn his second issue, Appellant argues the trial court erred by permitting Espinoza\n\nto testify about prior instances of domestic violence between her and Appellant.\n\nTo preserve error regarding evidence admission, a party must object each time\n\ninadmissible evidence is offered, obtain a running objection, or request a hearing outside\n\nthe jury\u2019s presence. Martinez v. State, 98 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); see\n\nalso TEX. R. EVID. 103(b). Here, Appellant voiced a relevance objection when the State\n\nbegan examining Espinoza about past domestic violence episodes, which the trial court\n\noverruled. He did not reurge that objection or request a running objection thereafter.\n\nAdditional evidence of the 2014 judgment documenting Appellant\u2019s guilty plea for assault\n\nfamily violence was admitted without objection. Espinoza also testified without objection\n\nthat she was the victim of that assault and that Appellant routinely asked her to drop\n\ncharges after other past incidents.\n\nMoreover, significant evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt was admitted beyond the prior\n\nviolence testimony. The jury also heard Appellant\u2019s recorded jail call admitting he grabbed\n\nher neck and related testimony.4 It heard Espinoza\u2019s raspy voice on her 911 call.\n\nEspinoza described how Appellant pushed her down, hit her, and grabbed her throat, and\n\nshowed the jury photographic evidence of her injuries.\n\nBecause Appellant did not continue objecting, request a running objection, or seek\n\na hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence, any error was not preserved. See, e.g., Ethington\n\n4 Without objection, Detective Erin McCullough testified that Appellant told Espinoza on the jail call:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really strangle you, I just put my hands around your neck.\u201d McCullough also testified about studies\nshowing strangulation victims are seven times more likely to be murdered by their abuser.\n\fv. State, 819 S.W.2d 854, 859\u201360 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991); Sanchez v. State, 595 S.W.3d\n\n331, 337\u201338 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, no pet.).\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled Appellant\u2019s two issues, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\nDo not publish.\n\n9"

Compl. [Dkt. # 1] at 1. Over the course of litigation, ATF produced documents\n\nin response to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request in thirteen separate productions. See Joint Status Reports\n\n[Dkt. ## 8\u20139, 11\u201319]. But in its final production, the agency inadvertently produced documents\n\nto plaintiffs showing information that had been marked for redaction under FOIA\u2019s statutory\n\nexemptions, but was not actually redacted. Joint Status Report [Dkt # 19] \u00b6 4. The Court issued\n\na temporary protective order sequestering the inadvertently produced records until it could\n\ndetermine whether the information the agency marked for redaction fell properly within the\n\nclaimed FOIA exemptions. Temporary Protective Order (Oct. 30, 2023) [Dkt. # 30] (\u201cTPO\u201d) at 1.\n\nNow before the Court is ATF\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J.\n\n[Dkt. # 32] (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.\u201d), and plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary protective order. See Pls.\u2019\n\fMot. to Lift Protective Order [Dkt. # 36] (\u201cPls.\u2019 Mot.\u201d). Both motions are fully briefed. See Pls.\u2019\n\nResp. to Def.\u2019s Mot.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20134. On April 28,\n\n2021, they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n\nFirearms & Explosives seeking records related to the agency\u2019s use of the National Instant Criminal\n\nBackground Check System (\u201cNICS\u201d). See Ex. A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] (\u201cEx. A\u201d); Compl. \u00b6 8.\n\nThe NICS is the system used \u201cto determine if an individual is prohibited from purchasing a\n\nfirearm.\u201d Second Decl. of Ginae Barnett [Dkt. # 32-3] (\u201cBarnett Decl.\u201d) \u00b6 14. Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs requested:\n\n(a) records showing the number of individuals for whom ATF is requesting\n or has requested NICS monitoring, during the 12-month period preceding\n this request;\n\n(b) records demonstrating the purpose(s) for which each individual has been\n monitored (i.e., suspected straw purchases, false statements, etc.);\n\n(c) records discussing the legality of NICS monitoring;\n\n(d) records demonstrating the number of individuals prosecuted as a result\n of being \u201cmonitored\u201d by the program (criminal case docket numbers will\n suffice); and\n\n(e) records demonstrating any reported unlawful or otherwise improper\n misuse of NICS monitoring by ATF personnel (or contractors of ATF).\n\fEx. A at 2. ATF acknowledged plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request by a letter dated August 24, 2021, see\n\nEx. B to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-2], and it \u201cproceeded to search for responsive records.\u201d Barnett\n\nDecl. \u00b6 4.\n\nHaving received no further response from ATF, on November 5, 2021, plaintiffs filed this\n\nsuit to compel the agency to release the requested information. Compl. at 1, 5. ATF answered the\n\ncomplaint and then, over the next year-and-a-half, it reviewed 4,559 potentially responsive\n\ndocuments, and it \u201cproduced all responsive records in 13 monthly productions.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 6;\n\nsee Def.\u2019s Answer [Dkt. # 5].\n\nOn September 6, 2023, ATF emailed its thirteenth production to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. Id. \u00b6 8.\n\nIt was compromised of \u201ca cover letter and a PDF file\u201d consisting of 115-pages. Id. Like the\n\nprevious twelve productions, the production contained emails in which ATF agents submitted\n\n\u201cNICS monitoring\u201d requests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). Id. \u00b6 13. The emails\n\nshowed the \u201cnames, email addresses, and sometimes telephone numbers\u201d of the ATF agents, FBI\n\nagents, and staff involved. Id. \u00b6 15. Most of the emails also included \u201cthe underlying investigative\n\ntarget\u2019s name\u201d and discussion of the investigation. Id. \u00b6 15. And each monitoring request also\n\nincluded a \u201cstandard form\u201d regarding the individual, or \u201csubject,\u201d for whom monitoring was\n\nrequested. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. The forms enabled the requesters to input the following categories of\n\ninformation:\n\n\u2022 Submit date\n \u2022 Requester\u2019s name, contact number, and e-mail address\n \u2022 Case number\n \u2022 Subject\u2019s name, date of birth, gender, race, social security number, state\n of residence, and place of birth\n \u2022 FBI number\n \u2022 State record number\n \u2022 Monitoring time frame\n \u2022 Suspected violation(s) of the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act\n \u2022 Detailed information about why the subject is under investigation\n\f \u2022 Detailed information about the investigation. What does the requester\n know and how do they know it?\n\nId. \u00b6 15. The last two bullet points on the form calling for \u201cdetailed information\u201d allow the\n\nrequester to provide \u201cnarrative responses,\u201d and some of the responses in the produced documents\n\nincluded: \u201cinformation furnished by witnesses or confidential sources,\u201d id. \u00b6 15; information from\n\nthe agency\u2019s \u201cFirearms Tracing System\u201d database, id. \u00b6 19; and information about the \u201cspecific\n\nlaw enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the investigation. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn advance of the production, ATF marked multiple pieces of information for redaction\n\npursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Barnett Decl. \u00b6 16. Under Exemption\n\n3, it marked for redaction the \u201crecords of specific firearms traces\u201d from the Firearms Tracing\n\nSystem database. Id. \u00b6 19. Under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), it marked for redaction the\n\n\u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d of ATF agents, FBI agents, agency personnel, and the\n\nsubjects, associates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nFinally, under Exemption 7(E), it marked for redaction information revealing \u201cspecific law\n\nenforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure utilized in the previous productions, ATF marked the\n\nrecords to be included in the thirteenth production with \u201cred boxes\u201d outlining the information it\n\nintended to redact. Id. \u00b6 7. The material in each red box was overlaid with text indicating the\n\napplicable FOIA exemption. Id. The procedure to be followed required the processor to select\n\n\u201cApply\u201d to create a new, redacted document. Id. Although the separate, redacted document was\n\ncreated for the thirteenth production, the agency inadvertently emailed plaintiffs a copy of the\n\nprevious version that still showed red boxes outlining the redactions and the contents of the boxes,\n\nnot the version that actually applied the redactions. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7\u20138.\n\f On September 8, 2023, two days after the agency released the thirteenth production,\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked ATF\u2019s counsel in an email, \u201c[c]an I get a redacted version of the final\n\nProduction #13?\u201d Attachment B to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] (emphasis in original). Fifteen\n\nminutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cIt seems there was an inadvertent production. Would\n\nyou please delete any copy that you may have downloaded? ATF will send you a replacement\n\nproduction.\u201d Attachment C to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. Nine minutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel sent\n\n\u201cthe proper version of production 13,\u201d containing the permanently applied redactions. Attachment\n\nD to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3].\n\nOn September 10, ATF\u2019s counsel asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to \u201cconfirm in writing that [he]\n\ndeleted any copy of the inadvertent production,\u201d noting the \u201csignificant privacy interests in the\n\nmaterial[.]\u201d Attachment E to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. The next day, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n\nresponded tartly: \u201cI do not have time today to consider much less respond to this request to delete\n\nwhat I was sent.\u201d Attachment F to Barnett Decl. [Dkt # 32-3] at 1. ATF\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cif you\n\ndo not confirm deletion of the materials, ATF plans to move for a protective order.\u201d Id.\n\nThe next day, a different attorney emailed ATF\u2019s counsel to say that he would \u201cbe\n\nrepresenting\u201d plaintiffs with respect to the \u201cplanned motion for protective order.\u201d Attachment H\n\nto Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] at 1. At that point, plaintiffs had both the redacted version and the\n\ninadvertently unredacted version of the thirteenth production in its possession, and one could easily\n\nascertain whether anything had been omitted that did not fall within a FOIA exemption. Yet\n\ncounsel took the following position:\n\n[O]ur review of these documents demonstrates that they may, like other\n documents received in this FOIA, and perhaps to a greater extent, reveal\n unauthorized or even illegal activity by ATF and the FBI, violating statutory\n requirements and jeopardizing the constitutional rights of federal firearms\n licensees and other Americans. Thus, we are concerned that, if we agree to\n your proposal and destroy the documents in our possession, those\n\f unauthorized or even illegal activities will be covered up by ATF. We do\n not agree voluntarily to be complicit in such a coverup. You have asked for\n our position on a protective order. We oppose . . . . [T]he error here is the\n government\u2019s alone, and we will resist any effort to make it appear that we\n have done anything wrong, or that ATF is somehow the \u201cgood guy\u201d here\n by, under the guise of protecting certain private information that it\n negligently disclosed, attempting to coverup its potential violations of\n statutes and constitutional rights.\n\nId. at 2.\n\nOn September 13, ATF moved for a protective order to shield the \u201cmaterial inadvertently\n\nproduced\u201d from dissemination, disclosure, or use until the Court decided the merits of its FOIA\n\nexemptions. Def.\u2019s Expedited Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 20] at 1, 7\u20138. Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe motion. See Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 28] (\u201cPls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective\n\nOrder\u201d). The Court granted the motion, and it ordered plaintiffs to \u201ctemporarily sequester\u201d the\n\ninadvertently produced file until a decision regarding the redactions could be made on the merits.\n\nTPO at 1.1 Defendant moved for summary judgment on December 8, and the parties fully briefed\n\nthe motion. See Def.\u2019s Mot.; Pls.\u2019 Resp.; Def.\u2019s Reply.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, ATF filed a notice of supplemental authority pointing to the D.C.\n\nCircuit\u2019s decision in Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police, 126 F.4th 708\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2025), and the parties were directed to file submissions addressing its impact on the\n\ndispute. See Def.\u2019s Notice of Suppl. Authority [Dkt. # 35]; Minute Order (Mar. 12, 2025); Pls.\u2019\n\nSuppl. Mem. [Dkt. # 37]; Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. [Dkt. # 38]. Plaintiffs also moved to lift the Court\u2019s\n\nprotective order in light of the Circuit\u2019s ruling. See Pls.\u2019 Mot. That motion is also fully briefed.\n\nSee Def.\u2019s Opp.; Pls.\u2019 Reply. The Court then ordered ATF to submit the unredacted thirteenth\n\n1 The order did not limit plaintiffs\u2019 use of the version of the thirteenth production with the\nredactions properly applied.\n\fproduction to the Court for in camera review, see Minute Order (Apr. 11, 2025), and ATF\n\nsubmitted the materials under seal. See Sealed Doc. [Dkt. # 41].\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\n\nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat summary\n\njudgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue for trial.\u201d Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if a\n\nreasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it is capable\n\nof affecting the outcome of the litigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236,\n\n1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In assessing a party\u2019s motion, the court must \u201cview the facts and draw\n\nreasonable inferences \u2018in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment\n\nmotion.\u2019\u201d Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States\n\nv. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWhen a federal agency receives a request for records under the Freedom of Information\n\nAct, the statute requires it to disclose the requested information unless it falls into one of FOIA\u2019s\n\fnine exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(3)(A), (b)(1)\u2013(9). In a \u201ctypical FOIA case concerning the\n\nwithholding of requested documents,\u201d the court decides \u201cthe applicability of a claimed FOIA\n\nexemption,\u201d Al-Fayed v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 254 F.3d 300, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and if it\n\ndetermines that the information does not fall within the exemption, the requester is entitled to it.\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\n\nThis is not the typical case. During the process of responding to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request,\n\nthe agency inadvertently produced a set of documents that were marked for redaction, but not\n\nactually redacted. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 7. The agency maintains in its motion for summary judgment\n\nthat all of the information designated for redaction falls within Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and\n\n7(E), Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315, and plaintiffs do not dispute that assertion. Plaintiffs \u201ctake no position\u201d\n\non the FOIA exemptions; indeed, they announce that they \u201chave no interest in the vast majority of\n\nthe . . . information ATF disclosed.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. In other words, plaintiffs do not claim that\n\nthey are entitled to any of the information the agency meant to withhold, and having seen it, they\n\nare not suggesting that they have any reason to disseminate the bulk of it further. Nonetheless,\n\nthey object to any order extending restrictions on the use of the material on principle.\n\nThe agency asks the Court to order plaintiffs to: (1) \u201csequester the September 6, 2023,\n\ninadvertently produced FOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate,\n\ndisclose, or use for any purpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent opinion in Human Rights Defense Center v. United\n\nStates Park Police bars the Court from ordering that relief and requires it to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order. See Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem.; Pls.\u2019 Mot. They also contend that an order sequestering\n\nthe inadvertent production would constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 27\u201332.\n\f The Court finds that defendant\u2019s motion and supporting declaration and its own review of\n\nthe materials in camera confirm that all the information marked for redaction in the inadvertent\n\nproduction falls properly within a FOIA exemption. Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment in its favor will be granted on the propriety of the exemptions. This also means that the\n\nCourt\u2019s interim order restricting the use of the information that defendant meant to redact until the\n\nlegitimacy of the redactions had been determined expires under its own terms, TPO at 1,2 and that\n\nthe challenge to that order is now moot.\n\nThe Court also finds that it has equitable authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested relief to bar\n\nplaintiffs from using or disseminating the inadvertently produced information. Plaintiffs have\n\nalready agreed to destroy the majority of the information at issue, which is properly exempt under\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D). Pls.\u2019 Reply at 23. As for the rest of the information, Human Rights\n\nDefense Center v. United States Park Police is distinguishable and does not control the instant\n\nsuit, and both Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent regarding the Court\u2019s equitable authority\n\nunder FOIA support a remedy that bars the use of FOIA-exempted information.\n\nI. All of the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n exemptions claimed by the ATF.\n\nThe ATF marked several sets of information for redaction in the thirteenth production, and\n\nits motion for summary judgment argues that those redactions were proper under FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315. Plaintiffs have \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated\n\n2 Plaintiffs argued that the Court lacked authority to let the temporary protective order stand.\nSee Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem. at 2\u20135.\n\fthat they \u201cdo not challenge\u201d the \u201clegality\u201d of the redactions, Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 5\u20136,3 and indeed, their\n\nopposition does not argue against any of the exemptions that ATF claimed. Id. at 6\u201333; see id. at\n\n6 (\u201cATF spends the majority of its briefing arguing that various redactions . . . would have been\n\nappropriate under various FOIA exemptions . . . . Plaintiffs take no position with respect to these\n\narguments.\u201d).\n\nAlthough plaintiffs make no effort to challenge the agency\u2019s FOIA exemptions, \u201c[u]nder\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion for summary judgment cannot be \u2018conceded\u2019 for\n\nwant of opposition.\u201d Winston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\n\u201cThe burden is always on the movant to demonstrate why summary judgment is warranted,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[t]he nonmoving party\u2019s failure to oppose summary judgment does not shift that burden.\u201d Id.,\n\nquoting Grimes v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 83, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Therefore, the Court\n\nmust still determine whether the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n\nexemptions claimed, even though plaintiffs do not contest the exemptions.\n\nThe Court has reviewed the agency\u2019s declaration in support of its motion, as well as the\n\nunredacted version of the thirteenth production in camera, and it concludes that all of the\n\ninformation ATF marked for redaction was properly exempt under FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C),\n\n7(D), and 7(E).\n\n3 See also Joint Status Report [Dkt. # 31] at 2 (\u201cPlaintiffs do not intend to challenge the\nFOIA redactions that could have been claimed, but were not made, on Production 13.\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Resp.\nat 1 n.1 (explaining that plaintiffs \u201cstyle[d]\u201d their opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment as a \u201cResponse\u201d rather than an \u201cOpposition\u201d because \u201cthe only disputed issue between\nthe parties is Defendant\u2019s motion for a permanent protective order . . . not summary judgment\u201d);\nPls.\u2019 Resp. to Def.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Fact [Dkt. # 33-1] at 1 (\u201cPlaintiffs generally\ndo not contest ATF\u2019s Statement of Material Facts . . . .\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Suppl.

Defendant can invoke all the FOIA exemptions it wants.\u201d).\n\f A. Exemption 3\n\nExemption 3 authorizes agencies to withhold information that is \u201cspecifically exempted\n\nfrom disclosure by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The statute must either: (1) \u201crequire[] that the\n\nmatters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,\u201d or\n\n(2) \u201cestablish[] particular criteria for withholding or refer[] to particular types of matters to be\n\nwithheld.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(A)(i)\u2013(ii). And if the statute was \u201cenacted after the date of enactment\n\nof the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\u201d it must \u201cspecifically cite[] to\u201d FOIA. Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(B). To\n\njustify its withholding, the agency \u201cneed only show that the statute claimed is one of exemption as\n\ncontemplated by Exemption 3 and that the withheld material falls within the statute.\u201d Larson v.\n\nDep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\nATF invoked Exemption 3 to withhold information regarding \u201cspecific firearms traces\u201d\n\nderived from ATF\u2019s Firearms Tracing System (\u201cFTS\u201d) database, most of which appears in the\n\nNICS monitoring request forms to explain \u201cwhy [ATF\u2019s] subject [was] under investigation.\u201d\n\nBarnett Decl. \u00b6 19. The agency asserts that the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552 (2011) (\u201cthe Act of 2012\u201d), bars it\n\nfrom disclosing the contents of the Firearms Tracing System. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5.\n\nCongress restricted the ATF\u2019s ability to disclose firearms tracing information in 2003,\n\nwhen it passed the Tiahrt Amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003,\n\nPub.

Iterations of this restriction have appeared in most, if not all, of the consolidated\n\fappropriations acts since 2003,4 until its most recent version in the Act of 2012. The current Act\n\nrequires:\n\nThat, during the current fiscal year and in each fiscal year thereafter, no\n funds appropriated under this or any other Act may be used to disclose part\n or all of the contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by\n the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\n Explosives . . . pursuant to section 923(g) of title 18, United States Code, or\n required to be reported pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (7) of such section,\n except to: (1) a Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement agency, or a\n Federal, State, or local prosecutor; or (2) a foreign law enforcement agency\n solely in connection with or for use in a criminal investigation or\n prosecution; or (3) a Federal agency for a national security or intelligence\n purpose; . . . and no person or entity described in (1), (2) or (3) shall\n knowingly and publicly disclose such data; and all such data shall be\n immune from legal process, shall not be subject to subpoena or other\n discovery, shall be inadmissible in evidence, and shall not be used, relied\n on, or disclosed in any manner, nor shall testimony or other evidence be\n permitted based on the data, in a civil action in any State (including the\n District of Columbia) or Federal court or in an administrative proceeding\n other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n Firearms and Explosives to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of such\n title, or a review of such an action or proceeding . . . .\n\nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat.\n\n552, 609\u2013610.\n\nBased on this language, most courts in this district have held that the government may\n\nwithhold trace information from the Firearms Trace System under Exemption 3. See, e.g.,\n\nAbdeljabbar v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 74 F. Supp. 3d 158, 172\u201377\n\n4 See Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 919 F. Supp. 2d 131, 145 (D.D.C. 2013); Watkins\n\nv. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, Civ. Action No. 04-800, 2005 WL 2334277, at *1\n\n(D.D.C. Sept. 1, 2005); McRae v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 869 F. Supp. 2d 151, 163 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nAnd although one court has held that the ATF cannot rely on the Act because it does not\n\n\u201cexpressly\u201d reference FOIA, see Fowlkes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives,\n\n67 F. Supp. 3d. 290, 300\u201301 (D.D.C. 2014), the Court is persuaded by the reasoning in Abdeljabbar\n\nthat:\n\n[T]he disclosure prohibitions set forth by Congress in the 2005 and 2008\n appropriations bills are still effective prospectively and beyond those fiscal\n years as a permanent prohibition, until such time as Congress expresses the\n intent to repeal or modify them. . . . Congress\u2019s uninterrupted use of this\n language in appropriations bills after 2009 supports the conclusion that\n Congress did not intend for the judiciary to depart from this long-standing\n position.\n\n74 F. Supp. 3d at 175\u201376. For their part, plaintiffs offer no reason as to why the Court should\n\ncome to a contrary conclusion; they do not argue against the agency\u2019s application of Exemption 3\n\nat all.\n\nThe Court has observed the information at issue and confirmed that it contains the firearms\n\ntracing information that the ATF is barred from publicly releasing. Therefore, the Court finds that\n\nthe agency\u2019s invocation of Exemption 3 is proper.\n\nB. Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D)\n\nATF invoked Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D) for the bulk of the information it marked for\n\nredaction: the personal information of ATF and FBI agents, agency personnel, and the subjects,\n\nassociates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Barnett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) serve similar goals. Exemption 6 shields any \u201cpersonnel and\n\nmedical files and similar files\u201d where \u201cdisclosure . . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\finvasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). The exemption is \u201cconstrued broadly to\n\ncover essentially all information sought from Government records that \u2018appl[y] to a particular\n\nindividual,\u2019\u201d Pinson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 202 F. Supp. 3d 86, 99 (D.D.C. 2016), quoting U.S.\n\nDep\u2019t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982), including \u201cpersonal information, such\n\nas names and addresses.\u201d Prison Legal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015),\n\nquoting Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Similarly,\n\nExemption 7(C) protects from disclosure information in law enforcement records that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(c).\n\nAlthough the application of both exemptions \u201cturns on a balance of the individual\u2019s right\n\nof privacy against the basic policy of opening agency action to the light of public scrutiny,\u201d CEI\n\nWash. Bureau, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 469 F.3d 126, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2006), (citation omitted),\n\nthe D.C. Circuit has held that Exemption 7(C) \u201cestablishes a lower bar for withholding material\u201d\n\nthan Exemption 6. Am. C.L. Union v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations\n\nomitted). So \u201cwhen an agency seeks to withhold records \u2018compiled for law enforcement purposes\u2019\n\nas implicating personal privacy, only Exemption 7(C) need be considered, since \u2018all information\n\nthat would fall within the scope of Exemption 6 would also be immune from disclosure under\n\nExemption 7(C.)\u2019\u201d Battle Born Invs. Co., LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., Civ. Action No. 24-067,\n\n2024 WL 5246515, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 2024), quoting Roth v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 642 F.3d\n\n1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nATF has shown that its redactions were appropriate under Exemption 7(C). As the\n\nagency\u2019s declarant explained, ATF \u201capplied minimal redactions as necessary to prevent the\n\ndisclosure of information that might reveal the identities of third parties\u201d within the production,\n\fincluding: (1) the personally identifiable information of ATF and FBI agents, and agency staff;\n\n(2) the social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, cell phone numbers, and family\n\nrelationships of the subjects of agency investigation; and (3) the identities of cooperating sources\n\nwho provided information to the government. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 27. There is a well-recognized and\n\nsubstantial privacy interest in withholding the identities of the law enforcement officers and\n\nsupport personnel conducting investigations. See, e.g., Lesar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 636 F.2d 472,\n\n487 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The Court of Appeals has also held that Exemption 7(C) protects the privacy\n\ninterests of all persons mentioned in law enforcement records, including suspects, witnesses, and\n\ninformants, Schrecker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and that such\n\nthird-party information is \u201ccategorically exempt\u201d from disclosure in the absence of an overriding\n\npublic interest. Nation Mag., Wash. Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 894, 896 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995).\n\nFurther, the agency\u2019s claimed redactions under Exemption 7(D) were proper. Exemption\n\n7(D) protects from disclosure information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . . . [who] furnished\n\ninformation on a confidential basis.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). A source is \u201cconfidential\u201d within\n\nthe meaning of Exemption 7(D) if they \u201cprovided information under an express assurance of\n\nconfidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.\u201d\n\nWilliams v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 69 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Here, the agency\u2019s\n\ndeclaration explains that the sources it redacted had provided tips to the ATF \u201cregarding potential\n\nillegal acquisition of firearms . . . with the implied assurance of confidentiality.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6\n\n25. The sources \u201chave ongoing relationships with ATF\u201d and \u201cwould likely be subject to retaliation\n\ffor that cooperation,\u201d so it is reasonable to infer that they provided information to the agency with\n\nthe understanding that their identities would be kept confidential. Id.\n\nAgain, plaintiff does not contest any of ATF\u2019s arguments regarding the application of\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), or 7(D), and the Court\u2019s review confirms the agency\u2019s assertions. Therefore,\n\nthe Court finds that ATF properly claimed these exemptions.\n\nC. Exemption 7(E)\n\nExemption 7(E) protects from disclosure law enforcement records \u201cto the extent that the\n\nproduction of such . . . information . . . would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). Exemption 7(E) \u201csets a relatively low bar\n\nfor the agency to justify withholding.\u201d Blackwell v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 646 F.3d 37, 42\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \u201cRather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing how the law will be\n\ncircumvented,\u201d it \u201conly requires that the [agency] demonstrate logically how the release of the\n\nrequested information might create a risk of circumvention of the law.\u201d Mayer Brown LLP v.\n\nInternal Revenue Serv., 562 F.3d 1190, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\nATF\u2019s declarant stated that the information claimed under Exemption 7(E) \u201creveals\n\nspecific law enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used to \u201cidentify certain individuals as\n\ninvestigative subjects.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 31. The information appears in the sections of the NICS\n\nforms asking for \u201cwhy\u201d the subject is under investigation and \u201chow\u201d ATF knows information\n\nabout the subject. Id. The Court agrees with ATF that disclosure of how the agency finds its\n\finvestigative subjects could logically enable individuals to \u201ccircumvent\u201d those techniques, id., so\n\nit finds that the agency\u2019s claim under Exemption 7(E) is proper.5\n\nD. Segregability\n\n\u201c[N]on-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably\n\nintertwined with exempt portions.\u201d Wilderness Soc\u2019y v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 2d 1,\n\n18 (D.D.C. 2004), quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1977). ATF\u2019s declaration explains that responsive records were reviewed \u201con a line-\n\nby-line and page-by-page basis\u201d to identify reasonably segregable information, and that all\n\n\u201cmeaningful segregable information was disclosed\u201d to plaintiffs. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 32. The Court\n\nhas also reviewed the un-redacted version of the production, and it came to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, it finds that the agency\u2019s redactions satisfy the segregability requirement.\n\nII. The Court has authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested order.\n\nWhat is left to determine is what, if anything, should happen now. Because the unredacted\n\ncopy of the thirteenth production was inadvertently produced to plaintiffs, ATF asks the Court for\n\nan order directing plaintiffs and their counsel to: (1) \u201csequester the . . . inadvertently produced\n\n5 Citing Conservation Force v. Jewell, 66 F. Supp. 3d 46, 64 (D.D.C. 2014), plaintiffs assert\nthat the ATF cannot withhold information regarding its law enforcement techniques and\nprocedures under Exemption 7(E) because those \u201ctechniques and procedures . . . are unlawful and\nunconstitutional.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 26 (emphasis in original). Indeed, plaintiffs spend a large portion\nof their brief arguing that the ATF and FBI\u2019s use of the NICS is illegal. Id. at 12\u201326. But plaintiffs\nhave not brought a suit against the agencies challenging the legality of the use of NICS; they chose\nto bring a claim under the Freedom of Information Act to enforce their request for information\nabout the ATF\u2019s use of NICS. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16\u201318. FOIA is a statute concerned with the disclosure\nof information in the government\u2019s possession.\n At any rate, Conservation Force is not on point. In that case, the agency withheld\ninformation pursuant to the attorney-client privilege under Exemption 5, and the court analyzed\nwhether the crime-fraud exception to the privilege applied. 66 F. Supp. 3d at 64; see id. (\u201cPlaintiff\nhas failed to prove that any crime or fraud was committed here, let alone that the communications\nat issue were made with an intent to further the unlawful act.\u201d). This case involves withholdings\nunder Exemption 7(E), which does not recognize an exception for crime or fraud.\n\fFOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate, disclose, or use for any\n\npurpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14.\n\nPlaintiffs take issue with the remedy only as it pertains to \u201csmall portions of [the]\n\nunredacted information.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. They do not \u201chave any interest in\u201d and \u201cagree to\n\ndestroy\u201d such records related to personally identifying information of the ATF and FBI agents,\n\nagency staff, and the subjects, associates, and informants of ATF investigation. Id. at 23\u201324. But\n\nthey do challenge the issuance of an order limiting the use of the unredacted information \u201crelated\n\nto the FBI and ATF\u2019s warrantless NICS Monitoring Program.\u201d Id. at 6, 15; see id. at 16\u201321\n\n(arguing that the public has significant interest in learning about how the \u201cNICS Monitoring\n\nProgram\u201d violates statutory prohibits and constitutional rights).\n\nSince plaintiffs have already agreed to destroy the personal information that the agency\n\nredacted under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), the Court will order it to do so. As to the rest of the\n\ninformation marked for redaction under Exemptions 3 and 7(E), the Court finds that it has the\n\nauthority to issue an order barring that information from dissemination or use.\n\na. Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police does not bar the\n Court from granting relief.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police\n\n(\u201cHRDC\u201d), 126 F.4th 708 (D.C. Cir. 2025), \u201csquarely rejected the notion\u201d that district courts have\n\ninherent authority to limit the use or dissemination of inadvertently disclosed FOIA material, and\n\ntherefore, the Court cannot grant ATF\u2019s relief. Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem. at 5; Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 3\u20137.\n\nDefendant counters that HRDC does not bar the relief sought here because: (1) it is distinguishable\n\nfrom this case; and (2) the Court can rely on its \u201cequitable power\u201d under FOIA, as opposed to its\n\n\u201cinherent authority,\u201d to enforce its judgment. Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. at 4\u20135; Def.\u2019s Opp. at 2\u20133.\n\f In HRDC, the plaintiff submitted FOIA requests to the Park Police for records of certain\n\n\u201cclaims or lawsuits brought against the agency or its employees.\u201d 126 F.4th at 714. The agency\n\nPolice released the records and \u201cwithheld the names of four police officers\u201d under Exemption 6.\n\nId. But \u201cdue to errors in its redaction process,\u201d the Park Police accidentally disclosed two names\n\nof private claimants that also should have been withheld under Exemption 6. Id. at 713\u201314. The\n\ndistrict court held that the Exemption 6 withholdings were justified as to both the officers and the\n\nprivate claimants, and it \u201cinvoked its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings . . . to issue\n\na clawback order for the erroneously produced names.\u201d Id. at 712, 714\u201315.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit reversed both rulings. First, it held that the withholding of the four\n\nofficers\u2019 names was improper because the agency failed to satisfy \u201cits burden to show that\n\ndisclosure . . . would compromise a substantial privacy interest.\u201d Id. at 715. The Court observed\n\nthat the Park Police\u2019s Vaughn index and supporting declarations were \u201cwholly conclusory,\u201d lacked\n\n\u201ceven minimal substantiation of the officers\u2019 privacy interest or the potential harm from disclosing\n\ntheir names,\u201d and \u201cmerely recite[d] the elements of the analysis for whether Exemption 6\n\napplie[d].\u201d Id. at 715\u201316.\n\nThen, without commenting on whether the inadvertently produced private citizens\u2019 names\n\nfell under Exemption 6, the Court vacated the clawback order. 126 F.4th at 719\u2013720. It took issue\n\nwith the lower court\u2019s use of its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings as a\n\n\u201cmechanism\u201d for compelling the return of inadvertently produced information when FOIA itself\n\ndid not provide for that remedy. Id. at 717. It stated that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s invocation of an inherent\n\npower must\u201d be either: (1) \u201cdocumented by historical practice\u201d; or 2) \u201csupported by an irrefutable\n\nshowing that the exercise of an undoubted authority would otherwise be set to naught.\u201d Id. at 718,\n\nquoting Cobell v. Norton, 334 F.3d 1128, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\n\fomitted). The Park Police did not argue that clawback was a \u201cdocumented historical practice,\u201d so\n\nthe Court only analyzed whether it was \u201cnecessary to buttress the district court\u2019s undoubted\n\nauthority over FOIA litigation.\u201d Id. at 718 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Circuit found that the order was not necessary, rejecting the agency\u2019s argument that it\n\nwas proper given the lower court\u2019s ruling that the inadvertently produced names fell under\n\nExemption 6. Id. at 718\u201319. The Circuit explained that \u201cnecessary\u201d orders were \u201climited to those\n\nwhich . . . are necessary to the exercise of all others,\u201d and it then listed the \u201cpowers\u201d previously\n\n\u201crecognized as necessary,\u201d including: admitting members to the bar, disciplining bar members,\n\npunishing contempt of court, vacating judgments based on fraud on the court, and punishing bad-\n\nfaith or vexatious conduct. Id. at 718, citing Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43\u201345 (1991)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because, in the Circuit\u2019s view, the \u201cprimary function\u201d of the\n\nclawback order at issue was \u201cnot to support a core judicial authority, but to fill a perceived hole in\n\nthe FOIA statute by enabling the government to put the proverbial cat back in the bag,\u201d the Court\n\nheld that it was an improper use of inherent authority. Id. at 718\u201319.\n\nThe Court went on to note that the clawback remedy could not \u201cbe squared with the terms\u201d\n\nor \u201cstructure\u201d of FOIA, given that the statute does not explicitly enable an agency to seek an order\n\ncorrecting an inadvertent disclosure. 126 F.4th at 719. The Court opined that \u201cCongress\n\npresumably acted deliberately in omitting general clawback authority from FOIA,\u201d and that,\n\n\u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations,\n\nFOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance governmental transparency.\u201d Id.\n\nStill, the Court observed:\n\nImportantly, the information at issue here is not subject to any independent\n legal prohibition on disclosure such as applies to classified documents, and\n we express no opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n analysis.\n\fId.\n\nOne problem with applying HRDC to the facts of the instant case is that the Circuit\u2019s\n\nanalysis on whether the agency properly invoked Exemption 6 referred only to the \u201cofficer names\u201d\n\nredacted by the agency, id. at 715\u201317, not the private claimants\u2019 names that were inadvertently\n\nproduced. As to that information, the Circuit moved directly to the question of whether the lower\n\ncourt had the authority to issue the clawback order at all, without deciding whether Exemption 6\n\napplied to the names in the first place. Id. at 718\u201319. So, it is not clear whether the Court\u2019s\n\ndiscussion about the clawback order was meant to reach inadvertently disclosed information that\n\nis properly, or as in this case, concededly, exempt.\n\nFurthermore, a close reading of HRDC reveals several important distinctions between that\n\ncase and this one. First, HRDC involved a plaintiff that was disputing the agency\u2019s withholdings\n\nunder FOIA, so the Circuit did not deal with the circumstances here: plaintiffs who did not contest\n\nthe agency\u2019s FOIA withholdings at all, and who have \u201cno interest\u201d in the majority of the\n\ninformation at issue. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. Given HRDC\u2019s determination that the Park Police failed to\n\nsupport its withholdings, it makes sense that clawback would not be available, whether or not it\n\nwas a proper exercise of authority, because the agency was not entitled to withhold the information\n\nin the first place. That is not the case here. As the Court has detailed, everything marked for\n\nredaction by the ATF was properly exempt, and the plaintiffs have agreed to destroy most of the\n\ninadvertently produced information.\n\nSecond, the majority of the information that plaintiffs seek to retain and to be able to\n\ndisseminate falls under Exemption 3, which authorizes ATF to withhold information that is\n\n\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure\u201d by the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). HRDC specifically carved Exemption 3 out of\n\fits ruling, noting that the information at issue was \u201cnot subject to any independent legal prohibition\n\non disclosure\u201d and that it expressed \u201cno opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n\nanalysis.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719. So, by its own language, the case does not bar the Court from granting\n\nrelief as to the Exemption 3 information, and it would be consistent with FOIA and the Act of\n\n2012 to restrain plaintiffs from disseminating such material.\n\nGiven the differences between the posture of this case and what the Court addressed in\n\nHRDC, that opinion does not control the outcome here.6\n\nIII. The law supports the Court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers under FOIA to\n fashion a remedy in accordance with Exemptions 3 and 7(E).\n\nAs far as the Court is aware, no court in this district has invoked its equitable power to bar\n\na plaintiff from disseminating or using information obtained by virtue of an agency\u2019s inadvertent\n\nproduction of FOIA-exempted information. The Freedom of Information Act itself says very little\n\nabout the remedies available under the statute. Its only language regarding the court\u2019s authority is\n\nsection 552(a)(4)(B), which vests \u201cthe district court\u201d with \u201cjurisdiction to enjoin the agency from\n\n6 The Court of Appeals in HRDC opined that the district court lacked inherent authority to\nmanage the case before it because \u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine\nthe parties\u2019 rights and obligations, FOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance\ngovernmental transparency.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719 (emphasis added). In this Court\u2019s view, that\nsentence ignores the fact that in many of the FOIA cases pending in this courthouse, the plaintiff\nhad to bring a lawsuit to activate the administrative process, and that often, it takes the court\u2019s\noversight and involvement to bring it to its conclusion. Once a lawsuit has been filed, the\nrelationship between the parties is not simply governed by agency regulations; it is the district\ncourt that establishes the schedule for the review and production of records by issuing orders. That\nis litigation. And during FOIA litigation, as in other civil litigation, the court may be called upon\nto manage and resolve disputes between the parties, or to direct them to take certain action by\nissuing other orders. Indeed, the FOIA statute explicitly recognizes this fundamental distinction\nbetween FOIA compliance as an administrative matter and FOIA litigation since it provides for an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs when a plaintiff has \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d in an\naction before the Court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). For those reasons, this Court takes issue with\nthe reasoning underlying that portion of the HRDC decision. But for the purposes of its ruling\nhere, the Court is adhering to Circuit authority, and its ruling with respect to the protective order\nis not predicated on \u201cinherent authority.\u201d\n\fwithholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld\n\nfrom the complainant.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). But both the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit\n\nhave commented on the relationship between FOIA and the court\u2019s equitable powers, and the\n\nextent to which a district court can fashion equitable remedies under the statute.\n\nIn Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1 (1974), a consolidation of\n\nthree cases, the FOIA requesters were companies that had contracts with the United States that\n\nwere subject to renegotiation under the Renegotiation Act. Id. at 3. During the negotiation process,\n\nthe government took the position that the companies had \u201crealized excessive profits\u201d under their\n\ncontracts, and when it refused to provide the documents supporting that determination, each\n\ncompany sought the information through FOIA requests. Id. at 4\u20135. After the government failed\n\nto respond to the requests, the companies filed suit under FOIA to compel the release of the\n\ninformation, and to enjoin \u201cany further renegotiation proceedings\u201d until the production. Id. at 5\u20136.\n\nThe district courts enjoined the renegotiation proceedings for each company. Id. at 6\u20138.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court ultimately found \u201cit unnecessary\u201d to decide whether the\n\ndistrict court could enjoin the negotiation proceedings because the companies had failed to exhaust\n\ntheir administrative remedies under the Renegotiation Act, id. at 20, it did comment on FOIA\u2019s\n\neffect on the court\u2019s equitable power to do so. First, the Court noted FOIA\u2019s purpose of \u201copening\n\nadministrative processes to the scrutiny of the press and general public,\u201d id. at 17, and the statute\u2019s\n\nlanguage conferring \u201cjurisdiction to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin\n\nthe agency from withholding agency records . . . improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\nat 18, citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(3). It then explained that while the statute\u2019s purpose and language\n\n\u201cmight suggest\u201d that \u201ccompelled production was intended to be the exclusive enforcement\n\nmethod,\u201d there was \u201clittle to suggest\u201d that FOIA \u201climit[s] the inherent powers of an equity court.\u201d\n\fId. at 19\u201320. In particular, the Court was persuaded that enjoining the release of information was\n\nnot the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d under FOIA because of: \u201c[t]he broad language of the FOIA, with its\n\nobvious emphasis on disclosure and with its exemptions carefully delineated as exceptions\u201d; \u201cthe\n\ntruism that Congress knows how to deprive a court of broad equitable power when it chooses so\n\nto do\u201d; and \u201cthe fact that [FOIA], to a definite degree, makes the District Court the enforcement\n\narm of the statute.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has provided further analysis on the extent and nature of the court\u2019s\n\nremedial power in FOIA cases, which it summarized and applied in Citizens for Responsibility and\n\nEthics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice (\u201cCREW\u201d), 846 F.3d 1235 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2017).\n\nIn CREW, the plaintiff sued to compel the Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d)\u2019s compliance\n\nwith FOIA\u2019s \u201creading-room\u201d provision, which \u201crequires agencies to \u2018make available for public\n\ninspection . . .\u2019 certain records, including . . . \u2018statements of policy and interpretations which have\n\nbeen adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1239, quoting\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2). The plaintiff asserted that OLC opinions were subject to the reading-room\n\nprovision, and it sought an injunction directing OLC to disclose all such documents. Id. at 1239\u2013\n\n40. But in addition to that primary form of relief, the requested injunction had four additional\n\n\u201cfeatures\u201d:\n\n(1) it would apply prospectively . . . to documents not yet created; (2) it\n would impose an affirmative obligation to disclose . . . documents\n regardless of whether someone specifically requests a given document;\n (3) it would mandate that OLC make documents available to the public, as\n opposed to just [the plaintiff]; and (4) it would require OLC to make\n available to the public an index of all such documents.\n\nId. at 1240 (emphasis in original). Concerned that FOIA did not give a district court the power\n\nto order the requested relief, the plaintiff sued under section 704 of the Administrative Procedure\n\fAct, which authorizes review of agency actions \u201cfor which there is no other adequate remedy in\n\na court.\u201d Id. at 1241, quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. But the district court dismissed the case because it\n\nfound that FOIA would provide for the plaintiff\u2019s requested remedy. Id. at 1238, 1240.\n\nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit considered whether the plaintiff could obtain the relief it was\n\nseeking under FOIA. Id. at 1241\u201342. First, it drew lessons from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in\n\nRenegotiation Board:\n\nFOIA section 552(a)(4)(B) vests courts with broad equitable authority.\n True, as the Supreme Court explained in Renegotiation Board v.\n Bannercraft Clothing Co., . . . that provision \u201cexplicitly confers jurisdiction\n to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin the agency\n from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency\n records improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d . . . But as the Court\n made clear in the same decision, Congress did not intend that language \u201cto\n limit the inherent powers of an equity court\u201d in FOIA cases. . . . \u201cOnce\n invoked, the scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers is broad, for breadth\n and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\u201d . . . This is especially so\n where, as here, \u201cfederal law is at issue and \u2018the public interest is involved,\u2019\n as a federal court\u2019s \u2018equitable powers assume an even broader and more\n flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.\u2019\u201d\n\nId. at 1241\u201342 (citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Court then explained that its own \u201ccase law reflects the wide latitude courts possess to\n\nfashion remedies under FOIA, including the power to issue prospective injunctive relief.\u201d Id. at\n\n1242. It pointed to Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), where\n\nthe Court said it was confronted with the Air Force\u2019s \u201crepeated failure to disclose documents in\n\nresponse to\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s valid FOIA requests. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242, citing Payne, 837 F.2d\n\nat 487. The Air Force eventually complied with the requests during the lawsuit, but because the\n\ngovernment exhibited a pattern of \u201crepeated delays\u201d and the plaintiff had an \u201cundeniable right\u201d to\n\nthe requested information, the Court of Appeals instructed the district court to: \u201cevaluate the\n\nlikelihood that the Air Force will return to its illicit practice of delay in the absence of an\n\finjunction\u201d and to \u201cconsider the propriety of injunctive relief\u201d to prevent future delay. Payne, 837\n\nF.2d at 488, 495.\n\nCREW then pointed to Morley v. Central Intelligence Agency, 508 F.3d 1108, 1120 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2007), as an example where it \u201crecognized courts\u2019 power to order relief beyond the simple\n\nrelease of extant records.\u201d CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. In Morley, the Court determined that the\n\nagency had failed to search for responsive material in a portion of records that were likely to be\n\nresponsive. 508 F.3d at 1119\u201320. Because FOIA has a \u201cpolicy of full agency disclosure,\u201d and a\n\nrefusal to release documents for reasons unrelated to the FOIA exemptions would constitute\n\nwithholding, the Court ordered the agency to conduct a more adequate search of its records, id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted), even though FOIA does not specifically provide\n\nfor that remedy.\n\nCREW cautioned, though, that \u201c[a]lthough broad, courts\u2019 remedial authority under section\n\n552(a)(4)(B) is not boundless,\u201d 846 F.3d at 1242, and it pointed to two previously recognized\n\nlimits. First, it noted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for\n\nFreedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980), that \u201cfederal courts have no authority to order the\n\nproduction\u201d of records no longer in the agency\u2019s possession. Id. at 139.\n\nThen it described the Circuit\u2019s decision in Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. United States\n\nDepartment of the Interior, 88 F.3d 1191 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In that case, the plaintiff sought an\n\norder requiring an agency to publish its regulations in the Federal Register in accordance with\n\nsection 552(a)(1) of FOIA. Id. at 1201\u201302. Although that section requires agencies to \u201cpublish . . .\n\nsubstantive rules of general applicability,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D), the Circuit looked to the\n\nremedial provision of FOIA to determine whether the relief sought was proper, and the Court found\n\nthat it could not order publication. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303. The remedial provision\n\fauthorizes courts \u201cto enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the\n\nproduction of any agency records improperly withheld from complainant.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). The Court reasoned that the language focusing on the \u201cproduction\u201d of\n\nrecords to \u201cthe complainant\u201d was aimed at \u201crelieving the injury suffered by the individual\n\ncomplainant, not by the general public,\u201d so it could not order the publication of regulations to the\n\npublic. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303.7\n\nAfter that discussion, the Court held in CREW that the district court had authority under\n\nFOIA to grant two of the forms of relief requested by the plaintiff: a prospective injunction to\n\ndisclose OLC opinions that had not yet been created, and an affirmative duty to disclose regardless\n\nof whether the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. But, relying on\n\nKennecott, it held that FOIA did not authorize the court to order OLC to make documents available\n\nto the public at large, as opposed to just the plaintiff. Id. at 1243.\n\nConsidering that authority, the Court finds that it falls within its equitable powers under\n\nFOIA to fashion a remedy that would bar the plaintiff from publishing inadvertently disclosed\n\ninformation that falls squarely within Exemptions 3 and 7(E). The Freedom of Information Act\n\nvests the district court with \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to settle disputes brought under the statute. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). Although section 552(a)(4)(B) states that courts can \u201cenjoin\u201d an agency from\n\nwithholding records, the Supreme Court recognized in Renegotiation Board that enjoining the\n\nagency is not the \u201cexclusive\u201d power under the statute, and that the language of that provision does\n\nnot \u201climit\u201d the Court\u2019s equitable power to grant other relief. 415 U.S. at 20. While FOIA is a\n\ndisclosure statute, Congress included nine exemptions that authorize the government to withhold\n\n7 The Court acknowledged, though, that \u201cit might seem strange for Congress to command\nagencies to \u2018currently publish\u2019 . . . documents, without in the same statute providing courts with\npower to order publication.\u201d Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202.\n\finformation, to advance a number of important interests. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(1)\u2013(9). The\n\nexemption at issue here, Exemption 3, makes it clear that FOIA disclosure cannot frustrate other\n\nstatutes that mandate against dissemination. And Exemption 7(E), which is involved to a lesser\n\nextent, gives special protection to law enforcement procedures and techniques to guard against\n\nfuture circumvention of the law. These interests, which were absent in HRDC, support the\n\ninjunction. Also, since this case involves the agency\u2019s attempt to withhold information that the\n\nstatute expressly exempts from public disclosure, it does not present the problem posed in\n\nKennecott Utah Copper Corp., where the court was being asked to take action that fell well outside\n\nthe statutory scheme.\n\nTherefore, the Court will exercise its equitable jurisdiction to enter an order barring the use\n\nof inadvertently disclosed information covered by Exemption 3 and 7(E).\n\nIV. The relief does not violate plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nFinally, plaintiffs contend that a protective order forbidding the dissemination of the\n\ninadvertently released information constitutes \u201ca classic prior restraint\u201d in violation of the First\n\nAmendment. Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective Order at 19.\n\n\u201cThe term prior restraint is used to describe . . . judicial orders forbidding certain\n\ncommunications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\u201d\n\nAlexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). A \u201cclassic\u201d case of prior restraint involves a governmental actor seeking a temporary\n\nrestraining order or permanent injunction to prevent the news media from publishing specific\n\ninformation. Id. at 550; see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)\n\n(featuring the President\u2019s attempt to secure a permanent injunction preventing the publication of\n\nthe Pentagon Papers after a whistleblower covertly shared them with the news media); Near v.\n\fMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697 (1931) (featuring local government officials seeking to\n\npermanently enjoin a local newspaper\u2019s publication of periodicals critical of the government).\n\nThis case does not present an unconstitutional prior restraint. \u201cAs a general rule, citizens\n\nhave no first amendment right of access to traditionally nonpublic government information,\u201d and\n\ntherefore \u201c[a] litigant seeking release of government information under FOIA . . . relies upon a\n\nstatutory entitlement \u2013 as narrowed by statutory exceptions \u2013 and not upon his constitutional right\n\nto free expression.\u201d McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Again, plaintiffs\n\ndid not contest the ATF\u2019s claimed FOIA exemptions, and the Court has already found that the\n\ninformation was properly exempt under the statute. So, because plaintiffs do not have a right to\n\nthe material found to be exempt under Exemptions 3 and7(E) in the first place, the Court\u2019s order\n\nsequestering it is not a violation of their First Amendment rights.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court will GRANT defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment [Dkt. # 32], and it will DENY AS MOOT plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order [Dkt. # 36]. A separate order will issue.\n\nAMY BERMAN JACKSON\n United States District Judge\n\nDATE: July 23, 2025\n\n29"

See Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, Exec. Order\n\nNo. 14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). The district court entered a universal\n\npreliminary injunction which bars implementation of the Executive Order.\n\nDefendants appeal, contending that the States lack standing to challenge the\n\nExecutive Order, that it was error to issue a preliminary injunction, and that the scope\n\n2 25-807\n\fof the injunction is overbroad.\n\nWe address whether the Executive Order is constitutional and valid.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n A\n The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted after the Civil War, in order to reject\n\nand refute the holding of Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 403 (1857), which in\n\nsubstance held that slaves and descendants of slaves were not citizens of the United\n\nStates, and \u201cto put citizenship beyond the power of any governmental unit to\n\ndestroy.\u201d Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 263 (1967).\n \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL 1904338 (D. N.H.\nJuly 10, 2025).\n\n3 25-807\n\f When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, whether birthright citizenship\n\napplied to the children of noncitizens was still an open question. But the Supreme\n\nCourt answered that question in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649\n\n(1898). When the case was decided, Chinese nationals in the United States were not\n\npermitted to become citizens. See Chinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, \u00a7 14, 22 Stat. 58,\n\n61 (1882). Chinese laborers could not re-enter the United States if they left. See\n\nScott Act, ch. 1064, 25 Stat. 504 (1888). Chinese laborers were also required to\n\nobtain a certificate of residence, and non-laborer Chinese persons were subject to a\n\nharsh presumption that they were unlawfully present. See Geary Act, ch. 60, 27 Stat.\n\n25 (1892).\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Supreme Court considered the case of Wong Kim\n\nArk, a Chinese-American man who was denied reentry to the United States, despite\n\nbeing born in the United States. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 652\u201353. The Supreme\n\nCourt canvassed English common law, early American decisions, and citizenship\u2019s\n\nmeaning to the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s drafters and then held that the Citizenship\n\nClause stands for \u201cthe fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the dominion\n\nof the United States, notwithstanding alienage of the parents[.]\u201d Id. at 68, 692\u201393.\n\nFor that reason, although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents would have been unable to\n\nnaturalize or even return to the United States, Wong Kim Ark acquired United States\n\ncitizenship \u201cby birth within the United States.\u201d Id. at 704\u201305. Since Wong Kim Ark\n\n4 25-807\n\fwas decided in 1898, and until this challenged Executive Order, the Judiciary,\n\nCongress, and the Executive Branch have consistently and uniformly protected the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s explicit guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the\n\nimmigration status of an individual\u2019s parents.\n\nB\n On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled\n\n\u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d Exec. Order No.\n\n14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). Section 1 of the Executive Order states\n\nin relevant part,\n\nthe privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to\n persons born in the United States:\n (1) when that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United\n States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or\n (2) when that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States at the\n time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited\n to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program\n or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United\n States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth.\n\n90. Fed. Reg. at 8449.\n\nSection 2 states that it is the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d that no federal\n\ndepartment or agency shall issue documents recognizing such persons as United\n\nStates citizens or accept documents issued by state governments recognizing such\n\npersons as citizens if they are born 30 days from the date the Executive Order was\n\nissued. Id.\n\n5 25-807\n\f Section 3 directs the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security, and Commissioner of Social Security to \u201ctake all appropriate\n\nmeasures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments\n\nand agencies are consistent with this order\u201d and mandates that officials cannot \u201cact,\n\nor forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\u201d Id. at 8449\u201350.\n\nC\n The day after the President signed the Executive Order, the States filed a\n\ncomplaint and motion for a temporary restraining order. The district court granted\n\nthe temporary restraining order. Shortly thereafter, the Individual Plaintiffs filed a\n\nputative class action. The district court consolidated the cases, and the States and\n\nIndividual Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Each group of plaintiffs moved\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, the district court granted a preliminary injunction,\n\nenjoining Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Order on a\n\nuniversal basis. The district court concluded that the States had standing and that\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 standing was undisputed. On the merits, the district court\n\nconcluded that the Executive Order likely violates both the Constitution and the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA). The district court also concluded that the\n\nStates would suffer \u201cirreparable economic harm in the absence of preliminary\n\nrelief,\u201d and that the Individual Plaintiffs faced the irreparable harm of \u201cconstitutional\n\ninfringement and the specter of deportation.\u201d Finally, the district court concluded\n\n6 25-807\n\fthat the balance of the equities and public interest strongly weighed in favor of\n\nentering a preliminary injunction, because \u201cthe rule of law is secured by a strong\n\npublic interest that the laws \u2018enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by\n\nexecutive fiat.\u2019\u201d The district court granted a universal injunction after determining\n\nthat a geographically limited injunction would be ineffective to relieve the States\u2019\n\nfinancial and administrative burdens.\n\nAfter the district court granted its injunction, other courts throughout the\n\ncountry also enjoined implementation and enforcement of the Executive Order. See\n\nDoe v. Trump, No. 25-cv-10135, 25-cv-10139, 2025 WL 485070, at *14\u201316 (D.\n\nMass. Feb. 13, 2025) (universal injunction); CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00201,\n\n2025 WL 408636, at *16\u201317 (D. Md. Feb. 2, 2025) (universal injunction); N.H.\n\nIndonesian Cmty. Support v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00038, 2025 WL 457609, at *6 (D.\n\nN.H. Feb. 11, 2025) (injunction \u201cwith respect to any individual or entity . . . within\n\nthe jurisdiction of this court\u201d). The Supreme Court accepted review on the scope of\n\nthe injunction and held that the universal scope of the injunction was impermissible\n\ninsofar as it was based on individual and associational plaintiff standing, leaving\n\nopen the question whether the universal injunction may be justified in order to give\n\ncomplete relief to the appellee States. Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. ____, No.\n\n24A884, 2025 WL 1773631 (June 27, 2025). The district court of New Hampshire\n\nhas since provisionally certified a nationwide class of plaintiffs and issued a\n\n7 25-807\n\fclasswide preliminary injunction, which it stayed until July 17, 2025, pending appeal\n\nin the First Circuit. See \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL\n\n1904338 (D. N.H. July 10, 2025).\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n A district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction, including the injunction\u2019s\n\nscope, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1073\n\n(9th Cir. 2024). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it rests its decision \u2018on an\n\nerroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous factual findings.\u2019\u201d Am. Beverage\n\nAss\u2019n v. City & County of San Francisco, 916 F.3d 749, 754 (9th Cir. 2019) (en\n\nbanc). Legal conclusions are reviewed de novo while factual findings are reviewed\n\nfor clear error. K.W. ex rel. D.W. v. Armstrong, 789 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\nIII. STANDING\n\nBecause a \u201cquestion of appellate jurisdiction must always be resolved before\n\nthe merits of an appeal are examined or addressed,\u201d we first address the questions of\n\nstanding. In re Application for Exemption from Elec. Pub. Access Fees by Jennifer\n\nGollan & Shane Shifflett, 728 F.3d 1033, 1036 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). \u201c[S]tanding must be met by persons seeking appellate\n\nreview, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.\u201d\n\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks and\n\n8 25-807\n\fcitation omitted). \u201cAll that is needed to entertain an appeal\u201d on an issue, however,\n\n\u201cis one party with standing.\u201d Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. 647, 665 (2021).\n\nUnder Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff has standing if\n\nthe plaintiff can show (1) an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is concrete and particularized and\n\nactual or imminent, not hypothetical; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the\n\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely, as opposed to merely\n\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defs.\n\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). Under this general rule, standing requires\n\na showing of injury, causation, and redressability. See id.\n\nA. STATE PLAINTIFFS\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a state has standing to bring suit where the\n\nfederal government\u2019s action directly reduces the number of individuals that a state\n\nentity serves, causing a loss of revenue that the state would have otherwise received\n\nunder an existing federal contract. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 490 (2023);\n\nsee also Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 767\u201368 (2019) (finding standing\n\nwhere the inclusion of a citizenship question was likely to lead to the undercounting\n\nof the states\u2019 populations, and that this undercounting would cause states to lose out\n\non federal funds distributed on the basis of state population); City & Cnty. of San\n\nFrancisco v. United States, 981 F.3d 742, 754 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that states\n\nhad standing to challenge a DHS rule that would render immigrants likely to\n\n9 25-807\n\fparticipate in federal programs inadmissible and ineligible for permanent residence\n\nstatus, thereby decreasing enrollment in public benefits and federal payments to the\n\nstates).\n\nHere, the States contend that the Executive Order would cause them an\n\neconomic injury by defunding and requiring substantial changes to existing public\n\nprograms such as Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title\n\nIV-E foster care, and Social Security Act (SSA)\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program.\n\nThe States have presented evidence that more than 1100 infants born each month in\n\nthe Plaintiff States would be subject to the Executive Order. If those infants are\n\ndenied citizenship, they will be ineligible for federally-backed state-run programs\n\nsuch as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care. States generally do not receive\n\nfederal reimbursements based on services to individuals who do not have a lawful,\n\nqualifying immigration status. The States accordingly allege that they will lose\n\nmillions of dollars of contracted reimbursements that they would otherwise receive.\n\nAlso, federal law requires the States to determine whether each resident served\n\nby federal benefits is eligible. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406. Because current State systems rely on birth\n\ncertificates, place of birth, or Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to determine\n\neligibility, the States contend that they will need to create new systems to determine\n\ncitizenship and maintain compliance with federal law. The States also contend that\n\n10 25-807\n\fthey will lose \u201cadministrative fees\u201d that they would otherwise receive under the\n\nSSA\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program. See Biden, 600 U.S. 489\u201390. State agencies\n\ntransmit birth data to the SSA to facilitate the assignment of SSNs, in exchange for\n\n$4\u20135 per SSN from the SSA. If the SSA no longer issued SSNs to children subject\n\nto the Executive Order, the States expect losses of $7,320\u2013$38,129 per year.\n\nDefendants argue these alleged losses are \u201cincidental downstream economic\n\neffects\u201d that are too indirect to confer standing. Defendants rely on United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023), wherein the Supreme Court stated in a footnote\n\nthat when a state asserts that federal law or policy has only generated indirect effects\n\non state revenues or state spending, \u201cthe State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n\nattenuated.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. Defendants also cite Washington v. FDA, 108 F.4th\n\n1163, 1175\u201376 (9th Cir. 2024), in which we held that a state did not have standing\n\nto challenge the FDA\u2019s elimination of its in-person dispensing requirement for\n\nmifepristone, because the state\u2019s claimed increase in Medicaid costs was too\n\nindirect.\n\nWe conclude that the States have shown that the loss of reimbursements,\n\nfunding, and additional expenses incurred by the development of a new system to\n\ndetermine eligibility are concrete and imminent injuries-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction. We agree with the district court\n\nthat the automatic and direct effect of denying citizenship to children affected by the\n\n11 25-807\n\fExecutive Order renders them ineligible for federal programs and for Social Security\n\nNumbers, which results in a quantifiable loss of funding to the States. Nothing about\n\nthis pecuniary injury is speculative given that it is \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d See\n\nClapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013). These losses are not an\n\n\u201cindirect\u201d effect on state spending that relies on a chain of causation with multiple\n\nlinks, or assumptions about the effects of medication, or the unpredictable actions of\n\nthird parties. Cf. Texas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3; Washington, 108 F.4th at 1175\u201376.\n\nInstead, as in Biden v. Nebraska, the direct effect of the challenged federal action is\n\nto decrease the number of people for which the state will receive federal funding and\n\n\u201cadministrative fees.\u201d 600 U.S. at 477, 489.\n\nDefendants\u2019 contentions to the contrary are not persuasive. They suggest that\n\nany economic losses would be \u201cself-inflicted,\u201d because the State need not provide\n\nsocial services to an individual who is ineligible under the federal program unless\n\nthey so choose. However, it was not a voluntary choice by the States for the federal\n\ngovernment to stop paying for these services, or to assume the costs that follow. See\n\nDep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767 (finding that losing \u201cout on federal funds that are\n\ndistributed on the basis of state population\u201d was a \u201csufficiently concrete and\n\nimminent injury to satisfy Article III\u201d). And the Supreme Court in Biden v.\n\nNebraska found that Missouri had alleged standing, even though its financial injury\n\nstemmed from its choice to service federal loans. See 600 U.S. 489\u2013490.\n\n12 25-807\n\fDefendants also claim that the Executive Order does not require any changes to State\n\nsystems and does not \u201cimpose any penalty for failing to make them.\u201d Although the\n\nExecutive Order does not on its face impose a duty on the States to change their\n\nmethods of determining federal eligibility, the States would nonetheless be required\n\nto make these changes to comply with other federal laws. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406.\n\nDefendants also argue that, even assuming that the States satisfy Article III,\n\nrecognizing standing here would violate the prohibition on parens patriae standing.\n\nA \u201c[s]tate does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the\n\nFederal Government.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458\n\nU.S. 592, 61 n.16 (1982). To be sure, the Supreme Court has denied states\u2019 attempts\n\nto assert third-party standing as \u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on\n\nparens patriae standing.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 n.11 (2023)\n\n(stating that Texas claimed third-party standing \u201con behalf of non-Indian families.\u201d);\n\nsee also Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024).\n\nBut the States here are not asserting standing based on the rights of their\n\ncitizens; instead, they assert injuries to their own pocketbooks that will be caused by\n\nenforcement of the Executive Order. Unlike in Brackeen and Murthy, the asserted\n\npocketbook injuries are concrete, particularized, and traceable. Cf. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. at 295\u201396 (\u201c[T]hese alleged costs are not \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to the placement\n\n13 25-807\n\fpreferences, which \u2018operate independently\u2019 of the provisions Texas identifies.\u201d);\n\nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 75 (\u201cThe States have not identified any specific speakers or\n\ntopics that they have been unable to hear or follow.\u201d).\n\nFinally, Defendants contend that third-party standing limitations also bar\n\nstanding for State plaintiffs. Prudential limitations on federal court jurisdiction\n\ndictate that: (1) a party must assert his or her own legal rights and interests, not those\n\nof others; (2) the courts will not adjudicate \u201cgeneralized grievances\u201d (i.e. \u201cabstract\n\nquestions of wide public significance\u201d); and (3) a party\u2019s claims must fall within\n\n\u201cthe zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\n\nguarantee in question.\u201d See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474\u201375 (1982) (citations omitted);\n\nsee also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) (a plaintiff \u201cmust assert his own\n\nlegal rights and interests\u201d); Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (noting\n\nthat a constitutional claim should be brought by the person \u201cat whom the\n\nconstitutional protection is aimed\u201d). However, \u201c[the Supreme Court] has allowed\n\nstanding to litigate the rights of third parties when enforcement of the challenged\n\nrestriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\u2019\n\nrights.\u201d Warth, 422 U.S. at 510.\n\nWe conclude that third-party standing limitations do not bar this action. The\n\nExecutive Order operates directly as to the States by preventing the States from\n\n14 25-807\n\freceiving funding and administrative fees that they would otherwise receive. In\n\naddition, the Executive Order prohibits departments and agencies of the United\n\nStates from accepting documents issued by State governments purporting to\n\nrecognize United States citizenship for persons subject to the Executive Order. See\n\n90 Fed. Reg. 8449. As a result, if the Executive Order is upheld, States will have to\n\nmodify their methods of determining United States citizenship and eligibility for\n\nfederal programs. The enforcement of the challenged government action against the\n\nStates thus results in the violation of third parties\u2019 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at\n\n510. We conclude that the States have standing to challenge the Executive Order as\n\nviolative of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause.\n\nB. INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS\n\nWe decline to exercise our jurisdiction with respect to the Individual\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 action and dismiss their claims. At the time that this lawsuit was filed,\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs were a group of pregnant women who are noncitizens with\n\npending applications for asylum, representing a putative class of pregnant persons\n\nand future children residing in Washington State. Defendants do not dispute their\n\nstanding. Individual Plaintiffs allege that their children would be denied citizenship\n\nas a result of the Executive Order taking effect, and that that denial of citizenship\n\nwould cause loss to them of various federal benefits. We agree with the district court\n\n15 25-807\n\fthat a denial of citizenship is a concrete and imminent injury-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction.\n\nHowever, one of the Individual Plaintiffs has since given birth while the\n\nExecutive Order is enjoined, meaning that her child is now a citizen, while the other\n\nIndividual Plaintiff was due to give birth earlier this month. Because Defendants\n\nclaim that the Executive Order does not have retroactive effect, if both Individuals\n\nhave given birth before this opinion is published, there may be a question of\n\nmootness as to the Individuals\u2019 claims. Typically, if a district court certifies a class\n\nbefore the class representative\u2019s claim becomes moot, \u201cmooting the putative class\n\nrepresentative\u2019s claim will not moot the class action.\u201d Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc.,\n\n653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011). \u201cBut where, as here, the plaintiff's claim\n\nbecomes moot before the district court certifies the class, the class action normally\n\nalso becomes moot.\u201d Slayman v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., 765 F.3d 1033, 1048\n\n(9th Cir. 2014). Because the district court below did not certify the class, there\n\nremains a question as to whether Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are moot, or whether\n\nan exception to mootness applies. We decline to address that question, because we\n\ndetermine that to the extent the Individual Plaintiffs have live claims, those claims\n\nare covered by the class action certified by the district court of New Hampshire in\n\nBarbara, and dismissal of the Individual Plaintiffs is proper on those grounds. \u201cA\n\ncourt may choose not to exercise its jurisdiction when another court having\n\n16 25-807\n\fjurisdiction over the same matter has entertained it and can achieve the same result.\u201d\n\nCrawford v. Bell, 599 F.2d 890, 893 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nThe district court of New Hampshire certified a class that includes:\n\nAll current and future persons who are born on or after February 20, 2025,\n where (1) that person's mother was unlawfully present in the United States\n and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person's birth, or (2) that person's mother's\n presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's\n father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the\n time of said person's birth.\n\nBarbara, 2025 WL 1904338, at *16. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children undoubtedly are\n\nencompassed by that class definition. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries on\n\nappeal relate to the harm faced by their children: the prospect of removal and\n\nseparation from their families, the exclusion from legal immigration status if not\n\nremoved, the denial of lawful employment and educational opportunities, and the\n\ndeprivation of both constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, both the class\n\ncertified in Barbara and the Individual Plaintiffs here seek an injunction of the\n\nExecutive Order on the basis that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the INA.\n\nSee id. at *1. There is no reason to believe that these claims will not be \u201cfully and\n\nvigorously litigated\u201d by the Barbara class representatives. See Crawford, 599 F.2d\n\nat 893. Because Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children can obtain relief for those injuries\n\nthrough the class certified by the District Court of New Hampshire, and because\n\nrelief in this court may conflict with or circumscribe the flexibility of relief in that\n\n17 25-807\n\fother case, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction over the Individual Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims and proceed only with the State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\nIV. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n A party is only entitled to a preliminary injunction if the party demonstrates\n\n\u201c[1] that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; [2] that [it] is likely to suffer an\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; [3] that the balance of equities\n\ntips in [its] favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter v.\n\nNRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \u201cLikelihood of success on the merits is \u2018the most\n\nimportant\u2019 factor; if a movant fails to meet this \u2018threshold inquiry,\u2019 we need not\n\nconsider the other factors.\u201d California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 575 (2018) (quoting\n\nDisney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation\n\nomitted)). We first consider whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits\n\nof their claims. Upon determining that they are likely to succeed, we then proceed\n\nto consider the remaining prongs of the Winter test.\n\nA. MERITS\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause. They also contend that the Executive Order\n\nviolates the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. We first address whether the Executive Order\n\nviolates the Citizenship Clause.\n\n18 25-807\n\f 1. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThe text of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause explicitly reads:\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside.\u201d U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. The parties dispute the meaning of \u201csubject to the\n\njurisdiction thereof.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the phrase \u201csubject to jurisdiction thereof\u201d means\n\n\u201csubject to United States authority and laws,\u201d and exempts a small and well-defined\n\ngroup of people who are born in United States territory yet not subject to United\n\nStates authority. Because the Executive Order attempts to exempt from citizenship\n\npersons who are both born in the United States and subject to United States authority,\n\nPlaintiffs contend that it violates the Citizenship Clause.\n\nDefendants, in contending that the Executive Order is constitutional, advance\n\na novel interpretation of the phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d They first\n\ncontend that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as used in the Citizenship Clause does not refer to\n\n\u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d i.e., jurisdiction as defined by a government\u2019s authority\n\nand lawmaking power, but instead refers to \u201cpolitical jurisdiction,\u201d which they\n\ndefine as \u201ca concept rooted in allegiance and protection.\u201d By their definition, persons\n\nare only subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States if they \u201cowe primary\n\nallegiance to the United States,\u201d excluding \u201cthose persons [who] owe allegiance to\n\n19 25-807\n\fa different sovereign.\u201d They then contend that a person only owes such allegiance\n\nto the country in which the person is permanently domiciled, and the domicile of a\n\nchild follows the domicile of the parent. They assert that because individuals present\n\ntemporarily or unlawfully in the United States cannot establish permanent domicile,\n\ntheir children born on United States soil do not owe allegiance to the United States\n\nand are not subject to its political jurisdiction.\n\na. Ordinary Meaning\n\nWe conclude that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment supports the\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 interpretation. In interpreting the text of the Constitution, courts are\n\n\u201cguided by the principle that \u2018[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the\n\nvoters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished\n\nfrom technical meaning.\u2019\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 544 U.S. 570, 576 (2008)\n\n(quoting United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 731 (1931)). When the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was adopted, as it is today, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was commonly used in\n\nreference to the power of the courts, defined as \u201c[t]he legal power or authority of\n\nhearing and determining causes.\u201d Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language 732 (1865). But in reference to nations, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was also\n\ndefined as the \u201c[p]ower of governing or legislating; the right of making or enforcing\n\nlaws; the power or right of exercising authority;\u201d and the \u201climit within which power\n\nmay be exercised,\u201d or \u201cextent of power or authority.\u201d Id; see also Benjamin\n\n20 25-807\n\fVaughan Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English\n\nJurisprudence 671 (1879) (defining jurisdiction as \u201c[t]he authority of government;\n\nthe sway of a sovereign power.\u201d). This ordinary meaning of jurisdiction is consistent\n\nwith Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d as subject to the\n\nlaws and authority of the United States.\n\nDefendants point to no contrary dictionary definitions that define jurisdiction\n\nin terms of allegiance and protection. Indeed, they make no arguments about the\n\nordinary meaning of the Citizenship Clause at all. Defendants\u2019 only argument based\n\non the text of the Citizenship Clause is that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d cannot\n\nsimply refer to \u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d because that definition would render the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s requirement of jurisdiction surplusage. They claim that the\n\nUnited States has \u201cexclusive and absolute\u201d regulatory jurisdiction within its\n\nterritory, so that all children born in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction.\n\nId. They further contend that that definition does not explain why certain groups,\n\nsuch as Native Americans and children of diplomats, were excluded from\n\ncitizenship.\n\nSupreme Court precedent makes clear that reading \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof\u201d to mean \u201csubject to United States authority and laws\u201d is not redundant. In\n\nWong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court directly addressed the meaning of the phrase\n\n\u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 169 U.S. 649. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he real\n\n21 25-807\n\fobject of\u201d the dual requirements of birth in U.S. territory and being subject to United\n\nStates jurisdiction was, \u201cto exclude, by the fewest and fittest words, (besides children\n\nof members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National\n\nGovernment, unknown to the common law), the two classes of cases, \u2013 children born\n\nof alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of\n\na foreign State, both of which . . . had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental\n\nrule of citizenship by birth within the country.\u201d Id. at 682.\n\nThe Court in Wong Kim Ark held that these \u201cclasses of cases\u201d are not fully\n\nsubject to United States authority and laws, despite Defendants\u2019 contentions to the\n\ncontrary. The Court, relying on Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in Schooner\n\nExchange, said that while \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is\n\nnecessarily exclusive and absolute,\u201d there are certain cases \u201cin which every\n\nsovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive\n\nterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 683\u2013684 (quoting Schooner Exch. v. McFaddon, 11\n\nU.S. 116, 136 (1812)). When a hostile foreign power occupies United States\n\nterritory, the Court said that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of the United States over the territory\n\n[is], of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be\n\nrightfully enforced there[.]\u201d Id. at 683 (quoting United States v. Rice, 17 U.S. 246,\n\n254 (1819)) (emphasis added). With respect to the immunity of foreign ministers\n\nfrom United States jurisdiction, \u201cthe immunity itself is granted by the governing\n\n22 25-807\n\fpower of the nation to which the minister is deputed.\u201d Id. at 685 (quoting Schooner\n\nExch., 11 U.S. at 138).\n\nThe Court contrasted these two groups with private individuals, who it stated\n\ncannot be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country that they are in, because,\n\nWhen private individuals of one nation spread themselves through another as\n business or caprice may direct . . . it would be obviously inconvenient and\n dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction, and\n the government to degradation, if such individuals or merchants did not owe\n temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of\n the country.\nId. at 685\u201386 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144) (emphasis added). The\n\nCourt\u2019s primary concern, in distinguishing private individuals from the exempted\n\ngroups, was whether they were subject to the laws and enforcement power of the\n\nUnited States. Because the Court in Wong Kim Ark reasoned that the words \u201csubject\n\nto the jurisdiction thereof\u201d must be understood \u201cin the same sense in which the like\n\nwords had been used by Chief Justice Marshall in the well known case of The\n\nExchange,\u201d the Court must have understood the phrase to refer to the United States\u2019s\n\nability to fully subject an individual to its laws. See id. at 687.\n\nThe Court in Elk v. Wilkins similarly exempted members of Indian tribes from\n\ncitizenship because they were not subject to the full regulatory authority of the\n\nUnited States.2 112 U.S. 94 (1884). While the United States could deal with the\n Congress later expanded citizenship to Native American children via statute. See\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(b) (1924).\n\n23 25-807\n\fTribes \u201ceither through treaties made by the President and Senate, or through acts of\n\nCongress in the ordinary forms of legislation,\u201d the Court in Elk recognized that,\n\n\u201c[g]eneral acts of Congress did not apply to Indians, unless so expressed as to clearly\n\nmanifest an intention to include them.\u201d Id. at 100\u201301. This statement reflects the\n\nunique position of the Tribes, which have sovereignty and are not subject to the full\n\nregulatory jurisdiction of the United States. See, e.g., Haaland v. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. 255, 310\u2013313 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (explaining that the Tribes have\n\ninherent sovereignty and are free from state jurisdiction and control).\n\nAccordingly, the Court in Elk said that members of Tribes were no more\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States \u201cthan the children of subjects of any\n\nforeign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born\n\nwithin the United States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign\n\nnations.\u201d 112 U.S. at 102. Regardless, the Court in Wong Kim Ark also held clearly\n\nthat \u201c[t]he decision in Elk v. Wilkins concerned only members of the Indian tribes\n\nwithin the United States, and had no tendency to deny citizenship to children born\n\nin the United States of foreign parents of Caucasian, African, or Mongolian descent,\n\nnot-in the diplomatic service of a foreign country.\u201d 169 U.S. at 682. Because the\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that children of diplomats, children of invading\n\narmies, and children of tribal members were understood not to be fully subject to\n\n24 25-807\n\fUnited States authority and laws, interpreting jurisdiction in accordance with its\n\nordinary meaning is not redundant.\n\nb. Supreme Court Precedent\n\nThe argument that Supreme Court precedent supports Defendants\u2019 reading is\n\nsimilarly unavailing. First, Defendants\u2019 claimed distinction between political\n\njurisdiction and regulatory jurisdiction is not supported by precedent. Both the\n\nSupreme Court and our Court have used \u201cpolitical jurisdiction\u201d to refer merely to\n\nthe United States\u2019 lawmaking authority. See, e.g., Smith v. Turner, 48 U.S. 283, 422\n\n(1849) (describing taxation as part of political jurisdiction); Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry.\n\nCo. v. McGlinn, 114 U.S. 542, 546 (1885) (describing political jurisdiction as\n\ninvolved in legislative power); Lake v. Ohana Mil. Cmtys., LLC, 14 F.4th 993, 1000\u2013\n\n01 (9th Cir. 2021) (equating political jurisdiction with \u201clegislative . . . jurisdiction\u201d).\n\nSecond, the Court did not hold or even hint that there was a requirement of\n\n\u201cprimary allegiance\u201d or exclusive allegiance in either Elk or Wong Kim Ark. To the\n\ncontrary, the Wong Kim Ark Court repeatedly equated allegiance merely with\n\nobedience to the laws of the sovereign, saying that \u201c[a]llegiance is nothing more than\n\nthe tie or duty of obedience of a subject to the sovereign under whose protection he\n\nis . . . .\u201d See, e.g., id. at 659\u2013661 (quoting Inglis v. Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 28 U.S.\n\n99, 155 (1830)). Under English common law, \u201c[s]uch allegiance and protection\n\nwere mutual . . . and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized\n\n25 25-807\n\fsubjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance; but were predicable of\n\naliens in amity, so long as they were within the kingdom.\u201d Id. at 655. Rather than\n\ndescribe this allegiance as primary or exclusive, the Court characterized the\n\nallegiance owed by foreign \u201cindividuals and merchants\u201d as \u201ctemporary and local\u201d\n\nwhich was necessary to avoid \u201csubjecting the laws to continual infraction.\u201d Id. at\n\n685 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144). The context of the opinion makes\n\nclear that the Court did not view allegiance as a separate and unspoken requirement\n\nof jurisdiction. Instead, it considered allegiance to be part and parcel of what\n\nDefendants now label \u201cregulatory\u201d jurisdiction.\n\nThird, the proposed requirement of \u201cpermanent domicile\u201d in order to establish\n\npolitical jurisdiction also finds no basis in the text of the Citizenship Clause or its\n\ninterpreting precedent. The Wong Kim Ark Court uses the phrase \u201cpermanent\u201d only\n\nin connection with domicile once, stating that although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents left\n\nthe United States in 1890, they \u201cwere at the time of his birth domiciled residents of\n\nthe United States, having previously established and still enjoying a permanent\n\ndomicil[e] and residence therein at San Francisco.\u201d Id. at 652. This statement\n\nreflects the stipulated facts of the case, and the Court did not mention \u201cpermanent\u201d\n\ndomicile in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause. See id. at 652 (\u201cThe facts of\n\nthis case, as agreed by the parties are as follows . . . .\u201d).\n\n26 25-807\n\f In its analysis, the Court said, \u201c[e]very citizen or subject of another country,\n\nwhile domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.\u201d Id. at 693. But the Court\n\nimmediately continued:\n\nIt can hardly be denied that an alien is completely subject to the political\n jurisdiction of the country in which he resides\u2014seeing that, as said by Mr.\n Webster, when Secretary of State, in his Report to the President on Thrasher\u2019s\n Case in 1851, and since repeated by this court, \u201cindependently of a residence\n with intention to continue such residence; independently of any domiciliation;\n independently of the taking of any oath of allegiance or of renouncing any\n former allegiance, it is well known that, by the public law, an alien, or a\n stranger born, for so long a time as he continues within the dominions of a\n foreign government, owes obedience to the laws of that government, and may\n be punished for treason, or other crimes, as a native-born subject might be,\n unless his case is varied by some treaty stipulations.\u201d\n\nId. at 693\u201394 (quoting 6 Daniel Webster, The Works of Daniel Webster 526 (1851)\n\n(emphasis added)). It is clear from this quoted passage both that domicile did not\n\nplay a significant role Scientology of Cal. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, 611 F.2d 738, 750 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nBut in rigorously applying our standing doctrine, I conclude that State\n\nPlaintiffs have no standing at this time. Absent a party with Article III standing, it\u2019s\n\npremature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the\n\ninjunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\nI.\n\nState Plaintiffs Lack Standing\n\nThe federal government asserts that the State Plaintiffs lack standing to\n\nchallenge the Executive Order. In response, State Plaintiffs claim standing to protect\n\ntheir sovereign and pecuniary interests. Neither ground establishes standing. First,\n\nState Plaintiffs haven\u2019t identified a cognizable sovereign interest, and they can\u2019t sue\n\nthe federal government on behalf of their citizens. Second, State Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted\n\fpecuniary injuries are too speculative and contingent at this stage to constitute\n\ninjuries in fact. Third, State Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged loss of federal reimbursements for\n\npublic benefits is a self-inflicted injury that doesn\u2019t confer standing. Finally, Biden\n\nv. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477 (2023), doesn\u2019t provide standing.\n\nA.\n\nNo Sovereign or Third-Party Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs first argue standing to bring this challenge based on their\n\n\u201csovereign interests\u201d or their ability to litigate constitutional claims that implicate\n\ntheir residents\u2019 individual rights.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory of standing is easy to dismiss. They assert a\n\n\u201csovereign interest\u201d in defending against regulation of \u201cstate citizenship.\u201d Even if\n\nsuch an interest exists, State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown how the Executive Order\n\nregulates state citizenship in any way. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447,\n\n482 (1923) (observing that States\u2019 \u201csovereign rights\u201d are not implicated if the federal\n\ngovernment does not \u201crequire the states to do or to yield anything\u201d). By its express\n\nterms, the Order only implicates the meaning of United States citizenship and only\n\ndirects action by federal executive agencies. And State Plaintiffs point to no\n\nlanguage in the Order that implicitly alters state citizenship. At most, they suggest\n\nthat deeming some of their residents not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United\n\nStates might confer on those residents \u201csome degree of immunity from state laws.\u201d\n\fAbsolutely nothing in the Executive Order says that, nor has any party advanced that\n\nview. So, while creative, this alleged injury is neither concrete nor imminent. This\n\ntheory easily fails.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 next theory of standing seeks to vindicate the rights of their\n\ncitizens. Altering who is a United States citizen, they assert, might affect their\n\nresidents\u2019 ability to vote in local elections, serve on juries, hold local office, and\n\nbecome police officers. They also argue that they can challenge the Order based on\n\na \u201clong history\u201d of state and local government challenges to Executive Branch action\n\nimpacting individual rights. Try as they may to disclaim it, distilled down, these\n\narguments are no more than an assertion of third-party standing on behalf of their\n\ncitizens\u2014also known as parens patriae. And it\u2019s blackletter law that \u201c[a] State does\n\nnot have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal\n\nGovernment.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 (2023) (simplified). That\n\nmakes \u201cth[is] issue open and shut.\u201d Id.\n\nStanding doctrine \u201cstrongly disfavors so\u2011called \u2018third\u2011party standing.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliam Baude & Samuel L. Bray, Proper Parties, Proper Relief, 137 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n153, 157 (2023). Generally, a party \u201cmust assert his own legal rights and interests,\n\nand cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201d\n\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (simplified). The risks of relaxing\n\nthird-party standing are obvious: \u201cthe courts might be \u2018called upon to decide abstract\n\fquestions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions\n\nmay be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial\n\nintervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\nGiven large state populations and the broad interests they may seek to\n\nvindicate, these concerns apply with greater force when States assert third-party\n\nstanding. Just as federal courts are not \u201croving commissions assigned to pass\n\njudgment on the validity of the Nation\u2019s laws,\u201d Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas,\n\nJ., concurring) (simplified), neither are States anointed privileged litigants to\n\nchallenge disfavored federal government action. Like other parties, States must\n\nshow a cognizable harm to themselves\u2014not just their residents\u2014before invoking\n\nfederal court jurisdiction to challenge federal government policy. As the Court\n\nrecognized long ago, \u201c[w]hile the state, under some circumstances, may sue [as\n\nrepresentatives of its citizens] for the protection of its citizens . . . it is no part of its\n\nduty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal\n\ngovernment.\u201d Mellon, 262 U.S. at 485\u201386. That\u2019s because \u201cit is the United States,\n\nand not the state, which represents them as parens patriae.\u201d Id. at 486.\n\nIndeed, in our constitutional system, the People are sovereign and do not need\n\nStates to act as intermediaries. See Ann Woolhandler & Michael G. Collins, State\n\nStanding, 81 Va. L. Rev. 387, 439 (1995) (arguing that the traditional \u201cpreference\n\nfor state-versus-individual actions over government-versus-government actions\n\fenhanced the status of the individual as a rights-holder against government\u201d);\n\nKowalski, 543 U.S. at 130 (considering \u201cwhether there is a \u2018hindrance\u2019 to the\n\npossessor\u2019s ability to protect his own interests\u201d when deciding whether to allow\n\nthird-party standing). After all, the common law basis for parens patriae was the\n\nneed to protect those who could not protect themselves. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son,\n\nInc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 600 (1982) (The royal prerogative\n\nserves to protect those who \u201care legally unable, on account of mental incapacity,\n\nwhether it proceed from 1st. nonage: 2. idiocy: or 3. lunacy: to take proper care of\n\nthemselves and their property.\u201d) (quoting \ufffd J. Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown 155\n\n(1820)); 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries 47 (The King \u201cis the general guardian\n\nof all infants, idiots, and lunatics.\u201d). Because our constitutional system enables\n\nindividuals to vindicate their own rights, courts should disfavor state third-party\n\nstanding.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a long history of upholding this principle. In South\n\nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), the Court held that South Carolina\n\nlacked standing to challenge a federal statute that the State alleged violated its\n\ncitizens\u2019 due-process rights. Because the State itself had no due process rights, it\n\ncould not raise its citizens\u2019 rights \u201cagainst the Federal Government, the ultimate\n\nparens patriae of every American citizen.\u201d Id. at 324. Next, in Brackeen, 599 U.S.\n\n255, the Supreme Court held that Texas did not have standing to argue that a federal\n\fstatute violated its citizens\u2019 equal-protection rights. Again, the Court held that a\n\nState could not \u201cassert third-party standing\u201d to bring a suit when the State itself\n\n\u201cha[d] no equal protection rights of its own.\u201d Id. at 294, 295 n.11. And most\n\nrecently, in Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024), the Court held that Missouri\n\nlacked standing to bring First Amendment claims against alleged federal government\n\ncensorship of its citizens on behalf of its citizens.\n\nSo State Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of standing to protect their residents collides with\n\nthird-party standing limitations. Though they couch it otherwise, we can\u2019t ignore\n\n\u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on parens patriae standing.\u201d\n\nBrackeen, 599 U.S. at 295 n.11. At bottom, State Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are their\n\nresidents\u2019 rights and relationships with the federal government. But as the numerous\n\nsuits filed by individual plaintiffs nationwide against the Executive Order show,\n\nindividuals are themselves capable of remedying any alleged injury. Given this, we\n\nmust deny third-party standing for State Plaintiffs.\n\nB.\n\nPecuniary Injuries Too Speculative and Contingent\n\nState Plaintiffs next assert an array of pecuniary harms to their fiscs. First,\n\nthey claim that the Executive Order will reduce their share of federal reimbursements\n\nfrom Medicaid, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d), and Title IV-E\n\nfoster care services. Because only services provided to those with U.S. citizenship\n\for certain legal immigration statuses are eligible for reimbursement under these\n\nfederal programs, State Plaintiffs allege that they will not receive reimbursements\n\nfor services provided to children born to undocumented aliens or aliens with\n\ntemporary visas. Second, the States maintain that they will incur administrative\n\nexpenses to redesign their public assistance programs and retrain their staff to verify\n\ncitizenship under the Executive Order. If citizenship is no longer determined by\n\nbirth in the United States, State Plaintiffs surmise that they will need to design new\n\ncitizen-verification protocols, update their IT infrastructure, and instruct staff to\n\nensure compliance with federal assistance programs. Finally, the States contend that\n\nthey will lose processing fees from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) for\n\ntransmitting birth-record data on U.S. citizens. Currently, the SSA pays State\n\nPlaintiffs $4 to $5 in service fees for the data, which the agency uses to generate\n\nSocial Security numbers. State Plaintiffs fear they will stop receiving this funding\n\nbecause some children born in their States will no longer be citizens under the\n\nExecutive Order.\n\nBut all these projected injuries suffer the same fatal defect. Because they sit\n\ndownstream of the Executive Order\u2019s direct effects, they rely on speculation about\n\nhow the Order might be implemented and assumptions about how independent third\n\nparties might react to its implementation. But \u201c[a]ny prediction how the Executive\n\nBranch might eventually implement\u201d the Executive Order is \u201cno more than\n\fconjecture.\u201d Trump v. New York, 592 U.S. 125, 131 (2020) (simplified). And so this\n\ncase \u201cdoes not\u2014at this time\u2014present a dispute appropriately resolved through the\n\njudicial process.\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\n1.\n\nAs stated above, we must rigorously enforce our Article III jurisdictional rules\n\nwhen asked to interfere with the actions of the political branches. \u201cA foundational\n\nprinciple of Article III is that \u2018an actual controversy must exist not only at the time\n\nthe complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified). So\n\nplaintiffs must satisfy \u201c[t]wo related doctrines of justiciability\u201d\u2014standing and\n\nripeness\u2014to advance an Article III case or controversy. Id.\n\nFirst, to show standing, plaintiffs must establish an injury in fact, causation,\n\nand redressability. Speculation can\u2019t be used to satisfy these requirements. The\n\ninjury in fact must be \u201cconcrete, particularized, and imminent rather than conjectural\n\nor hypothetical.\u201d Id. (simplified). Alleged injuries must be \u201cimpending\u201d with some\n\n\u201ccertain[ty];\u201d the mere \u201cpossibl[ility]\u201d of \u201cfuture injury\u201d is \u201ctoo speculative for\n\nArticle III purposes.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (simplified). And the causation\n\nrequirement \u201crules out\u201d standing based on \u201cattenuated links,\u201d such as \u201cwhere the\n\ngovernment action is so far removed from its distant (even if predictable) ripple\n\neffects that the plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing.\u201d FDA v. All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 383 (2024). So \u201cPlaintiffs cannot rely on\n\fspeculation about \u2018the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the\n\ncourts\u2019\u201d to claim standing. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5 (simplified). The bottom\n\nline\u2014any asserted injury can\u2019t be \u201ctoo speculative or too attenuated.\u201d All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs must show the case is \u201cripe\u201d for judicial intervention. A\n\nclaim that hinges on \u201ccontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or\n\nindeed may not occur at all\u201d is \u201cnot ripe for adjudication.\u201d Texas v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (simplified). When challenging federal actions, courts\n\noften defer review until a concrete controversy crystallizes. That\u2019s because\n\n\u201c[d]etermination of the scope\u201d of a federal action \u201cin advance of its immediate\n\nadverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an\n\ninquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &\n\nWarehousemen\u2019s Union, Loc. 37 v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224 (1954). This is\n\nespecially so when a case \u201crequire[s] guesswork as to how independent\n\ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 413.\n\n2.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of pecuniary injuries are \u201criddled with\n\ncontingencies and speculation.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 131. Their theory of standing\n\nrequires us to swallow two big pills\u2014(1) state standing based on speculative\n\nassumptions about the indirect, downstream costs of federal government action; and\n\f(2) state standing based on predictions about how a federal policy might be\n\nimplemented. Together, these concerns doom jurisdiction.\n\na.\n\nTo begin, the Executive Order itself doesn\u2019t directly withhold funding to the\n\nStates or require the States to expend any funds. And we should be skeptical of state\n\nchallenges to executive action premised on indirect fiscal effects. As the Court\n\nrecently told us:\n\n[I]n our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies\n frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\n And when a State asserts . . . that a federal law has produced only those\n kinds of indirect effects, the State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n attenuated.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3.\n\nIn Texas, Texas and Louisiana advanced the same derivative-costs theory that\n\nState Plaintiffs make here. The two States challenged new Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (\u201cDHS\u201d) Guidelines prioritizing the arrest of only certain undocumented\n\naliens. See id. at 673\u201374. To establish standing, they claimed that leaving more\n\nundocumented aliens within their borders would force them to spend \u201cmore money\n\non law enforcement, incarceration, and social services.\u201d Id. at 687 (Gorsuch, J.,\n\nconcurring). Even crediting those factual assertions, the Court found the alleged\n\ninjury \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d to support state standing. See id. at 680 n.3. After all,\n\fcontingent injuries, like those based on economic harms tied to predicted population\n\nchanges, will seldom amount to a cognizable Article III injury.\n\nAs Chief Judge Sutton asked in a similar context:\n\nAre we really going to say that any federal regulation of individuals\n through a policy statement that imposes peripheral costs on a State\n creates a cognizable Article III injury for the State to vindicate in\n federal court? If so, what limits on state standing remain? Even though\n it \u201cwould make a mockery . . . of the constitutional requirement of case\n or controversy,\u201d the States\u2019 boundless theory of standing\u2014in which all\n peripheral costs imposed on States by actions of the President create a\n cognizable Article III injury\u2014would allow them to challenge a\n \u201cdisagreeable war.\u201d Alexander Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966\n Sup. Ct. Rev. 79, 89\u201390 (1966). That is a bridge much too far.\n\nArizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J.) (simplified).\n\nTo Chief Judge Sutton\u2019s concerns, I add my own. Taken to its logical\n\nendpoint, the States\u2019 theory would grant them standing to contest virtually any\n\nfederal action that might tangentially affect who lives or is born within their borders.\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to State Plaintiffs, every person who crosses their borders\n\nrepresents a monetary cost or benefit on their financial ledgers. Consider some\n\nexamples. If the President were to raise the annual refugee cap\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because the presence of more aliens might someday increase state\n\nexpenditures on schools or emergency medical care? Or if Congress were to permit\n\nnationwide over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because easier access could depress future birth rates, and thereby\n\nreduce the accompanying SSA administrative fees? Indeed, why wouldn\u2019t a State\n\fhave standing to challenge the removal of a single alien from within its borders given\n\nthe individual\u2019s potential fiscal impact on the State? The Constitution\u2019s case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement does not stretch so thin.\n\nIf bare conjecture that a federal action might marginally alter a State\u2019s\n\npopulation\u2014and thereby its finances\u2014were sufficient for standing, the injury-in-\n\nfact prerequisite would mean little. States would be empowered to litigate every\n\nnational policy dispute under the guise of protecting their treasuries. Merely by\n\nhypothesizing downstream fiscal effects, States could enjoy near-automatic access\n\nto federal court while other litigants face exacting hurdles. Such asymmetry\n\nthreatens to convert States into de facto \u201cgeneral-public-interest plaintiffs,\u201d drawing\n\nArticle III courts into political contests we were never meant to referee. Ann\n\nWoolhandler & Michael G. Collins, Reining in State Standing, 94 Notre Dame L.\n\nRev. 2015, 2030 (2019). At a minimum, we should require costs to state treasuries\n\nto be \u201cdirectly traceable\u201d to the federal government action to establish standing.\n\nBiden, 600 U.S. at 490.\n\nb.\n\nBut these indirect effects aren\u2019t the end of the story. Because the Executive\n\nOrder was essentially enjoined on day one, we don\u2019t know how it will actually be\n\nimplemented. The Executive Order directs federal agencies to \u201cissue public\n\nguidance\u201d within 30 days \u201cregarding this order\u2019s implementation with respect to\n\ftheir operations and activities.\u201d But the district court immediately enjoined any\n\nfederal agency from \u201c[t]aking any further steps in reliance on the Executive Order,\u201d\n\nincluding providing any implementation guidance. Thus, nothing indicates the\n\ngovernment\u2019s plan for enforcing the Order, and any prediction as to how it will do\n\nso is merely a guess.\n\nCourts are often reluctant to recognize standing or ripeness when a\n\ngovernment action is challenged too soon to understand its consequences. See, e.g.,\n\nTrump, 592 U.S. at 132\u201334; Missouri ex rel. Koster v. Harris, 847 F.3d 646, 653 (9th\n\nCir. 2017) (concluding that \u201callegations about the potential economic effects\u201d of a\n\nlaw yet to be implemented \u201cwere necessarily speculative\u201d). Predicting how a\n\npresidential parchment setting a policy goal transforms into the mechanics of actual\n\ngovernment policy \u201cinvolves a significant degree of guesswork.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S.\n\nat 132. Given that the government will eventually need to consider \u201cboth legal and\n\npractical constraints, making any prediction about future injury just that\u2014a\n\nprediction.\u201d Id. at 133. Recognizing standing and ripeness based on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries risks premature interpretation of federal policy on a barebones\n\nrecord.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries depend on discretionary decisions that have\n\nyet to be made, and so any assessment of their claims to standing can only be made\n\nafter further development. Allowing \u201cthe Executive Branch\u2019s decisionmaking\n\fprocess [to] run its course\u201d would \u201cbring[] more manageable proportions to the\n\nscope of the parties\u2019 dispute,\u201d and supply the clarity essential to our review. Id. at\n\n134 (simplified). Rather than breeze past our constitutional limits to get to the\n\nmerits, all this uncertainty requires restraint. Simply, that the Executive Order could\n\nbe administered in a way that harms State Plaintiffs does not establish that it will be\n\nso administered. Nothing prevents the federal government from adopting measures\n\nthat would reduce or eliminate any projected costs to the States. But until those\n\ndiscretionary choices are made, State Plaintiffs\u2019 purported injuries remain \u201ctoo\n\nspeculative\u201d and \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383. So\n\nArticle III demands we wait until the federal government provides its plans before\n\nacting. If State Plaintiffs\u2019 fears become concrete after implementation is announced,\n\nfederal courts will stand ready to fulfill their constitutional duty.\n\n* * *\n\nBased on these twin concerns\u2014speculation on indirect, downstream costs and\n\nassumptions about uncertain implementation\u2014judicial intervention at this stage is\n\npremature.\n\n3.\n\nDrilling down more closely on State Plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations confirms\n\nthat they are, at this time, too speculative and too contingent.\n\f State Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of fiscal injury begins from the premise that every child\n\ndenied citizenship under the Executive Order will likewise be categorically barred\n\nfrom Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care benefits. But the Executive Order\u2019s\n\n\u201cimpact on funding is [un]certain.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 133. Each of these federal\n\nprograms extends not exclusively to U.S. citizens, but also to certain \u201cqualified\n\naliens.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(b). The Executive Order itself is silent on what\n\nimmigration status these children would receive. If they are granted lawful\n\npermanent residence, parole, or another qualifying status, the federal benefits\u2014and\n\nthe accompanying federal reimbursements\u2014could remain available. See id. State\n\nPlaintiffs also presuppose, again without support, that the federal government will\n\nwithhold every dollar of matching funds, that no other appropriations or grants will\n\noffset the difference, and that private social-service groups will not fill any gaps in\n\ncoverage.\n\nThus, the Executive Order \u201cwill not inexorably have the direct effect on\n\ndownstream access to funds or other resources predicted by\u201d State Plaintiffs. Trump,\n\n592 U.S. at 133. How the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d),\n\nDHS, and other federal agencies will address these issues is a \u201cfundamental\n\nuncertainty impeding proper judicial consideration at this time.\u201d Id.\n\nNor do State Plaintiffs identify any evidence that federal agencies will\n\nimplement the Executive Order in the maximally punitive fashion they predict.\n\fWashington, for example, suggests without evidence that it will lose pregnancy-care\n\nreimbursements for undocumented women whose newborns will lack citizenship.\n\nThat is merely a guess.\n\nState Plaintiffs also rely on demographic assumptions to allege these\n\npecuniary harms. They assume that the population of undocumented aliens in their\n\nStates will remain constant, that families will not relocate or repatriate, and that they\n\nwill seek coverage under the specified state programs. Whether any of this occurs\n\nturns on a morass of independent variables, including interstate migration patterns,\n\neconomic cycles, immigration enforcement policies, future congressional\n\nappropriations, and the discretionary policy choices of state, local, and federal\n\ngovernments.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of \u201cadministrative burdens\u201d fares no better. It depends\n\non a string of unsupported predictions: that HHS, SSA, and other relevant agencies\n\nwill immediately rewrite eligibility regulations, refuse to grandfather existing\n\nprocesses, mandate immediate and costly system overhauls, and deny both\n\ntransitional funding and phased\u2011compliance periods. Yet federal agencies possess\n\nample discretion to soften any new requirements\u2014by staggering effective dates,\n\nsupplying technical assistance, or fully subsidizing implementation\u2014and the record\n\ncontains no indication that they will choose the most onerous path. In any event,\n\nbecause the Executive Order by itself doesn\u2019t direct States to alter their verification\n\fsystems, the expenses State Plaintiffs might elect to incur at this stage are \u201cat least\n\npartly within [their] own control,\u201d and are neither imminent nor unavoidable. Lujan\n\nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992).\n\nFinally, State Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed loss of Social Security processing fees rests\n\non still another unsupported chain of speculation: that SSA will bar newborns\n\nwithout U.S. citizenship from receiving Social Security numbers, that SSA will see\n\nno value in continuing to receive the data supplied by State Plaintiffs, and that SSA\n\nwill withhold the processing fee. State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown that SSA will refuse\n\nto either assign Social Security numbers to non-U.S. citizens or compensate States\n\nfor transmitting birth-record data regardless of citizenship. See, e.g.,\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.104(a).\n\nAll this is too speculative and contingent to support jurisdiction over State\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim at this stage. Article III doesn\u2019t give courts license to game out\n\n\u201cwhat-ifs\u201d or to indulge worst-case scenarios. State Plaintiffs\u2019 fiscal projections rest\n\non a chain of speculative assumptions\u2014hypothesizing the most punishing\n\nimplementation to inflict maximum financial loss. In short, every fiscal injury that\n\nState Plaintiffs project depends on compounded assumptions about how multiple\n\nindependent actors\u2014federal agencies, healthcare administrators, private social\n\nservices, and even individual parents\u2014might respond to the Executive Order. The\n\nalleged harms don\u2019t flow from the Executive Order \u201cin the abstract,\u201d but rather from\n\fwhatever measures the federal agencies may eventually adopt to implement its\n\ndirective. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009). This is\n\ninsufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\n\nRigorous enforcement of the Article III requirement is indispensable. Without\n\nit, federal courts would become a forum for any parties to air generalized grievances.\n\nEven worse, federal judges would be transformed into \u201cvirtually continuing\n\nmonitors of the wisdom and soundness\u201d of federal government action. Allen v.\n\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 760 (1984) (simplified).\n\nC.\n\nAny Lost Reimbursement Would Be Self-Inflicted\n\nIn addition to being too speculative and contingent, any loss of federal\n\nreimbursements for state assistance programs would not give rise to Article III\n\nstanding because it would be a \u201cself-inflicted injur[y]\u201d\u2014\u201cnot fairly traceable to the\n\n[federal government\u2019s] purported activities.\u201d See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 418. Even\n\nif losses in federal reimbursements were to come to fruition, they would be caused\n\nby State Plaintiffs\u2019 own voluntary choices to extend benefits to aliens ineligible to\n\nreceive federal benefits. Simply, the \u201cunilateral decision[] by a group of States\u201d to\n\nextend healthcare and other benefits to those not entitled to federal reimbursement\n\ndoes not create a basis to attack the Executive Order because any \u201cfinancial injury\u201d\n\nsuffered would be \u201cdue to their own independent\u201d decisions. FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S.\n\f289, 297 (2022). After all, State Plaintiffs \u201ccannot manufacture standing merely by\n\ninflicting harm on themselves[.]\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416.\n\nPennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 (1976), tells federal courts to guard\n\nagainst self-inflicted injuries by States. In that case, Pennsylvania gave its residents\n\ntax credits for taxes paid to other States. In turn, New Jersey taxed income earned\n\nby Pennsylvanians in New Jersey. The result\u2014Pennsylvania lost tax revenue\n\nbecause of New Jersey\u2019s tax. Id. at 662\u201363. Pennsylvania then sued New Jersey.\n\nThe Court wasn\u2019t sympathetic to Pennsylvania. \u201c[N]othing prevent[ed]\n\nPennsylvania from withdrawing [its tax] credit for taxes [its residents] paid to\n\nNew Jersey,\u201d according to the Court. Id. at 664. Thus, the \u201cinjuries to the [State\u2019s]\n\nfisc[] were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by the[] . . . state legislature[].\u201d\n\nId. So when a State can avoid lost revenue by changing its tax laws, that State lacks\n\nstanding to recoup the funds. Although Pennsylvania was a matter of original\n\njurisdiction, the Court later made clear its principle also applies to Article III\n\nstanding. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297.\n\nState Plaintiffs complain that the Executive Order will cause them to lose\n\nfederal reimbursement for their social assistance programs. They identify several\n\nstate-funded programs\u2014such as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care\u2014which\n\nthey say will be underfunded because of the Executive Order. But any unreimbursed\n\fexpenditures would be the result of the States\u2019 choices to offer services to those\n\nineligible for reimbursement\u2014not the Executive Order.\n\nTake Washington\u2019s \u201cApple Health\u201d program. Apple Health is the umbrella\n\nname for Washington\u2019s medical assistance programs, which include the state-run\n\nside of Medicaid and CHIP. Both federal programs reimburse States a certain\n\npercentage of funds used to cover qualifying healthcare expenses. Historically, the\n\nCHIP federal match has been about 65%. Under federal law, with some limited\n\nexceptions, illegal aliens and those without a qualifying immigration status are not\n\neligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or other federal benefits. So federal reimbursement is\n\ncontingent on U.S. citizenship or another qualifying immigration status, such as\n\nbeing a legal permanent resident. Despite those restrictions on federal\n\nreimbursement, Washington decided to provide healthcare coverage to income-\n\nqualified children \u201cregardless of immigration status.\u201d So while citizenship or lawful\n\nimmigration status is a prerequisite for Medicaid or CHIP reimbursement,\n\nWashington volunteers to cover all children\u2014even if they do not meet the\n\n\u201cimmigration status requirements\u201d for federal reimbursement.\n\nThis is a classic self-inflicted loss. Washington\u2019s theory of injury is that the\n\nExecutive Order will lead to more non-U.S. citizens residing in the State, that the\n\nState will need to provide healthcare benefits for those aliens, and that the federal\n\ngovernment will refuse to reimburse the State for those benefits. But the decision\n\fto provide coverage to individuals regardless of immigration status was\n\nWashington\u2019s alone. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 74.09.470. Indeed, just last year, in\n\n2024, Washington chose to expand its medical assistance programs to\n\nundocumented adults. See 2023\u201325 Supplemental Operating Budget, ch. 376,\n\n\u00a7 211(82)(a), 2024 Wash. Laws 1, 338\u201339. Presumably, State Plaintiffs would argue\n\nthat this brand new policy decision exacerbates their alleged injury.\n\nThough States may extend their assistance programs to anyone they like, the\n\nfederal government\u2019s refusal to reimburse them for a voluntary policy decision\n\nwould not create a cognizable injury. Put differently, had Washington not\n\nindependently chosen to cover undocumented aliens\u2019 healthcare expenses, then the\n\nExecutive Order would not impact Washington\u2019s reimbursements at all. The federal\n\ngovernment would continue to provide reimbursements for those who qualify. That\n\nthe State elects to service residents beyond those who qualify for federal\n\nreimbursement makes its alleged injury directly traceable to Washington State\u2014not\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nUltimately, \u201c[n]othing in the challenged [Executive Order] required the\n\nplaintiff States to offer [expanded healthcare benefits]; accordingly, the financial\n\ninjury those States [allege they will suffer is] due to their own independent\u201d funding\n\ndecisions\u2014not the Executive Order. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297 (citing\n\fPennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664). And \u201c[n]o State can be heard to complain about\n\ndamage inflicted by its own hand.\u201d Pennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664.\n\nD.\n\nBiden v. Nebraska Doesn\u2019t Confer Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs rely chiefly on Biden v. Nebraska to conclude that their\n\nasserted pecuniary injuries support standing. They cite the case for the proposition\n\nthat when the federal government cuts the number of accounts a state entity serves\u2014\n\nand thereby decreases the federal funding or administrative fees to which the State\n\nwould otherwise be entitled under a contract or grant\u2014the federal government\n\ncauses the State to suffer a concrete and direct injury. That may be a fine abstract of\n\nBiden, but it\u2019s far afield from the derivative injuries State Plaintiffs assert here.\n\nSimply put, the alleged harms in Biden were the direct and inescapable result of\n\nfederal action and were in no way speculative or contingent.\n\nBiden arose from the federal government\u2019s attempt to forgive a wide swath of\n\nstudent loans. See Biden, 600 U.S. at 487\u201389. In August 2022, the Department of\n\nEducation announced that it was issuing \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d under the\n\nHigher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. See id. at 487. As\n\nit turned out, these \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d amounted to a plan to forgive a\n\nmonumental sum of student debt. See id. The plan was \u201cstraightforward\u201d\u2014\n\nborrowers with incomes below $125,000 would have their loans discharged up to\n\f$10,000 per borrower. Id. at 488. Estimates projected 43 million borrowers eligible\n\nfor relief and cancellation of about $430 billion in debt principal. Id.\n\nThat impending loan cancellation set off alarm bells for Missouri. Years\n\nbefore, Missouri had created the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority\n\n(\u201cMOHELA\u201d), an instrumentality of the State, to hold and service student loans. See\n\nid. at 488\u201389, 490\u201391. MOHELA owned over $1 billion of loans. See id. at 489.\n\nFurther, it had contracted with the federal government to service nearly $150 billion\n\nof federal loans\u2014meaning that MOHELA would collect payments on those loans\n\nand provide customer service to borrowers. See id. This was good business for\n\nMOHELA, which received $88.9 million in administrative fees for the five million\n\nfederal accounts it serviced. Id. at 489\u201390. The loan-forgiveness plan would have\n\ncompletely discharged \u201croughly half of all federal borrowers\u201d\u2014meaning\n\n\u201cMOHELA could no longer service those closed accounts.\u201d Id. at 490. So if the\n\nloan-forgiveness plan took effect, MOHELA would lose \u201c$44 million a year in fees\n\nthat it otherwise would have earned under its contract with the Department of\n\nEducation.\u201d Id. That \u201cfinancial harm [was] an injury in fact directly traceable to the\n\nSecretary\u2019s plan.\u201d Id.\n\nThe alleged injuries in Biden were certain and direct, not speculative or\n\ncontingent. Because the \u201cterms of the debt cancellation plan [were]\n\nstraightforward,\u201d there was no way MOHELA could escape unscathed\u2014it was\n\fgoing to lose $44 million a year as a direct result of the plan. Id. at 488, 490. That\u2019s\n\nnot the case here. As discussed above, it\u2019s speculative what effect the Executive\n\nOrder will have on the reimbursement and administration of Medicaid, CHIP, and\n\nTitle IV-E programs. Any fiscal impact would only be derivative of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s implementation. And since the preliminary injunction went into effect\n\nbefore the government had an opportunity to sketch out the specifics of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s enforcement, a real possibility exists that the federal government may\n\nmitigate any downstream consequences affecting these assistance programs. The\n\nsame goes for the SSA\u2019s processing fees. Nothing stops the federal government from\n\ncontinuing to collect birth data from the States or from continuing to pay processing\n\nfees. On these contingent questions, the Executive Order is silent. So the Executive\n\nOrder by itself doesn\u2019t command that States lose future downstream payments or\n\npayouts.\n\nThus, while Biden supports the proposition that the loss of federal funding or\n\nadministrative fees can be a \u201cdirect\u201d injury for standing purposes, that principle begs\n\nthe question of whether such a loss will occur at all. The more indirect and\n\nderivative the costs, the more those injuries become speculative and contingent.\n\nPicture it this way, a scraped knee is the predictable\u2014and maybe even likely\u2014\n\nconsequence of riding a skateboard. And once a child falls from his skateboard and\n\nbloodies his knees, that child has suffered a \u201cdirect injury.\u201d But no one would say\n\fthat the child was \u201cinjured\u201d as soon as his parents gifted him the skateboard\u2014no\n\nmatter how predictable the injury may have been. Likewise, the speculative and\n\ncontingent consequences of the Executive Order on federal funding and\n\nadministrative fees is worlds apart from the \u201cstraightforward\u201d terms of the\n\ncancellation plan in Biden\u2014which clearly would have discharged \u201croughly half\u201d of\n\nthe loans MOHELA serviced. Id. at 488, 490. In short, Biden does not control this\n\ncase because that case had nothing to do with Article III\u2019s bar on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries.\n\nII.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t have jurisdiction to review State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims at this\n\ntime, I do not address their merits or the scope of the district court\u2019s injunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\n30"

Prior to trial, Ortiz-Rodriguez moved to\ndismiss his indictment by collaterally attacking his 2017 deportation order\nunder 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). The district court denied his motion.\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 2 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nOn appeal, Ortiz-Rodriguez argues that he satisfied \u00a7 1326(d) because\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings involved an unknowing and\ninvoluntary waiver of judicial review and violated his due process rights by\nerroneously determining that he had committed an aggravated felony. We\ndisagree, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n I\n Ortiz-Rodriguez is not a citizen of the United States but has lived in\nthe United States for most of his life. In February 2017, Ortiz-Rodriguez\npleaded guilty in Texas state court to \u201cEvading Arrest or Detention\u201d with a\nvehicle, a third-degree felony. 1 Ortiz-Rodriguez was sentenced to two years\nof imprisonment, but before his sentence ended, DHS began expedited\nremoval proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). In October 2017, DHS\nagents served Ortiz-Rodriguez with a \u201cNotice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order\u201d (also known as a \u201cNotice of Intent\u201d or \u201cI-\n851\u201d), which informed him that he was deportable because his evading-arrest\nconviction qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\n In addition to summarizing the expedited removal procedures, 2 the\nform notified Ortiz-Rodriguez that he could be represented by counsel (at his\nown expense), explained that he had the right to file a petition for review of\nthe order in a United States Court of Appeals, and provided checkboxes\nwhere Ortiz-Rodriguez could contest his deportability or request withholding\nof removal on various grounds. The form is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix. 3\n\n_____________________\n See Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 38.04.\n See also Valdiviez-Hernandez v. Holder, 739 F.3d 184, 187 (5th Cir. 2013) (per\ncuriam) (summarizing expedited removal procedures).\n Infra at 27-28.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 3 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nAgents \u201cexplained and/or served\u201d the Notice of Intent to Ortiz-\nRodriguez in English, and Ortiz-Rodriguez signed to acknowledge that he\nreceived the Notice of Intent. Ortiz-Rodriguez also affixed his signature and\nprinted his name within another section, beneath three checked boxes, which\nstated:\n [(1)] I Do Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding\n of Removal[,] [which was the heading of the section and was in\n bold font.]\n [(2)] I admit the allegations and charge in this Notice of Intent.\n I admit that I am deportable and acknowledge that I am not\n eligible for any form of relief from removal. I waive my right to\n rebut and contest the above charges. I do not wish to request\n withholding or deferral of removal. I wish to be removed to\n Mexico[.] [\u201cMexico\u201d was handwritten.]\n [(3)] I understand that I have the right to remain in the United\n States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for judicial review.\n I do not wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\n DHS then prepared a Final Administrative Removal Order, served\nthe order on Ortiz-Rodriguez, and removed him in January 2018. At the time,\nOrtiz-Rodriguez did not challenge or appeal the expedited removal.\n Following his removal, Ortiz-Rodriguez reentered the United States\ntwice, and he pleaded guilty both times to illegal reentry pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326. For each removal proceeding, DHS reinstated the October 2017\nremoval order and deported him. Then, in May 2023, Border Patrol agents\nfound Ortiz-Rodriguez in Texas, and Ortiz-Rodriguez \u201cfreely and readily\nadmitted\u201d that he was \u201cpresent in the United States without any\nimmigration documents allowing [him] to be in or remain in the United\nStates.\u201d A federal grand jury indicted Ortiz-Rodriguez on one count of\nviolating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), which provides that \u201cany alien who . . . has\nbeen . . . deported, . . . and thereafter . . . enters, attempts to enter, or is at\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 4 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nany time found in, the United States\u201d without permission \u201cshall be fined\nunder Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\u201d 4\n Ortiz-Rodriguez waived his right to a jury and agreed to a stipulated\nbench trial. Ortiz-Rodriguez also moved to dismiss the indictment under 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), which allows for a collateral attack on the validity of a prior\ndeportation order if certain prerequisites are met. 5 Ortiz-Rodriguez attacked\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings, arguing that his evading-arrest\nfelony conviction should no longer qualify as an aggravated felony based on a\n2018 Supreme Court decision and subsequent Fifth Circuit decision that\nresulted in Texas\u2019s evading arrest offense no longer qualifying as a crime of\nviolence that would support removal. 6\n The district court denied Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s motion to dismiss,\nholding that Ortiz-Rodriguez \u201cfailed to show that the [2017 expedited\nremoval] procedure denied him judicial review as required by \u00a7 1326(d).\u201d\nOrtiz-Rodriguez was found guilty and sentenced to fifty-one months of\nimprisonment. Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, but the\ndistrict court granted his motion for an extension of time to file a notice of\nappeal, 7 and Ortiz-Rodriguez appealed within the extended filing window.\n This appeal is consolidated with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s appeal in case No.\n24-50224, in which Ortiz-Rodriguez appealed from the revocation of a three-\nyear term of supervised release imposed as a result of a conviction in a prior\n\u00a7 1326 prosecution.

In United States\nv. Mendoza-Lopez, 18 the Supreme Court explained that where \u201cwaivers of []\nrights to appeal were not considered or intelligent, respondents were\ndeprived of judicial review of their deportation proceeding.\u201d 19 Under our\nprecedents, Ortiz-Rodriguez has the burden of showing that his waiver was\ndeficient: \u201cWhere, as here, the government has produced a written and\nsigned stipulation to removal and waiver of rights, the burden rests with the\ndefendant to show that the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d 20\n Ortiz-Rodriguez broadly argues that his \u201cwaiver was not considered\nand intelligent\u201d because it \u201cfalsely misled\u201d him first by \u201ctelling him that his\nTexas escape conviction was categorized as an aggravated felony\u201d and\nsecond by \u201cnot tell[ing] [him] that he could challenge that determination.\u201d\n The Notice of Intent stated that Ortiz-Rodriguez was deportable\n\u201cbecause [he] ha[d] been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined\nin . . . 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(F),\u201d and the form listed his evading-arrest\nconviction as the qualifying crime. Ortiz-Rodriguez is correct that Texas\nevading arrest is not currently an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d at least under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). 21 However, at the time of Ortiz-\n\n_____________________\n 481 U.S. 828 (1987).\n Id. at 840.\n United States v.

Palomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. 321, 327-28 (2021) (\u201c[Section]\n1326(d)\u2019s first two procedural requirements are not satisfied just because a noncitizen was\nremoved for an offense that did not in fact render him removable.\u201d).\n See United States v.

We do not agree. Since the\nlaw governing the classification of aggravated identity theft was unsettled at the time of the\nappellant\u2019s removal, we cannot fairly conclude that the appellant was misled at all. A\nwaiver of rights based on a reasonable interpretation of existing law is not rendered faulty\nby later jurisprudential developments.\u201d).\n 804 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2015).\n See id. at 722-23 (reviewing the challenge for plain error and resolving it on due\nprocess grounds).\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 10 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nlater turns out to be erroneous does not render a waiver of rights unknowing\nor involuntary. Like Ortiz-Rodriguez, Cordova-Soto argued that a change in\nlaw made her earlier waiver of rights unknowing and involuntary. 27 We held\nthat Cordova-Soto was unable to show that she was deprived of the\nopportunity for judicial review, despite the Supreme Court determining, a\nfew months after her removal proceedings, \u201cthat an offense such as [her]\ndrug conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony.\u201d 28\n Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s second point\u2014that the form misled him into\nbelieving he could not challenge the aggravated felony finding\u2014is also\nunavailing. Specifically, Ortiz-Rodriguez argues that the checkboxes on the\nsecond page of the Notice of Intent misled him. Ortiz-Rodriguez notes that\nthe checkboxes provided opportunities for him to \u201ccontest his deportability\u201d\non factual grounds\u2014such as disputing his citizenship status or whether he\nwas convicted of the predicate offense\u2014but that there is no box for him to\ndispute the legal conclusion that his evading arrest conviction was an\naggravated felony. However, the form elsewhere noted his right to petition\nto \u201cthe appropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,\u201d and it did not state that\nonly factual challenges were permitted. 29 Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s subjective belief\nthat he could not challenge the Notice of Intent\u2019s legal conclusions does not\n\n_____________________\n Id. at 722.\n Id. at 722-24.\n See United States v.

The\nfirst page of the Notice of Intent, located above the checkboxes that\npermitted Ortiz-Rodriguez to admit or contest removability, advised him that\nhe had other options and rights. The page stated he had the right to seek\ncounsel from a \u201clist of available free legal services provided to [him].\u201d It also\nstated he had the right to respond to the charges within thirteen calendar days\nand that his response could \u201crequest, for good cause, an extension of time;\nrebut the charges . . . ; request an opportunity to review the government\u2019s\nevidence; admit deportability; designate the country to which\u201d he would be\nremoved with certain reservations; \u201crequest withholding of removal\u201d under\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or deferral of removal; and request withholding or\ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The page further\nstated he could file a petition for review in a United States Court of Appeals.\n The second page of the Notice was on the back. It contained a\ncertificate of service, where Ortiz-Rodriguez signed an acknowledgment that\nhe received the Notice of Intent. Beneath that certificate of service were the\naforementioned boxes, which permitted an immigrant to check whether\nremoval was contested. Ortiz-Rodriguez was not required to check either\nbox. But he did, and he signed the additional signature line beneath those\nboxes. Just above that signature line, the Notice repeated that he had \u201cthe\nright to remain in the United States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for\njudicial review.\u201d The next two sentences in that same paragraph said, \u201cI do\nnot wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\u201d After reviewing all the\ninformation on the first page, and the information on the second page, Ortiz-\nRodriguez signed on this line.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez had other options; to name one, he could have left\nboth boxes unchecked and filed a written response within thirteen days as the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 15 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nother side of the form expressly told him was an option. The only thing Ortiz-\nRodriguez had to do when served with the Notice was to sign and\nacknowledge receipt\u2014he was not required to contest or admit removability.\n The Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in Charleswell is more helpful to the\nGovernment than to Ortiz-Rodriguez. There, Charleswell launched\ncollateral challenges to both a removal order and a reinstatement order. 45\nThe Third Circuit held that Charleswell was not deprived of an opportunity\nfor judicial review of the removal order despite a \u201csubstantive error of law\u201d\nby the immigration judge (IJ). 46 However, the Third Circuit held that\nCharleswell was \u201cdenied the opportunity of judicial review of the\nreinstatement order\u201d because \u201creasonable persons reading [Charleswell\u2019s\nreinstatement notice] would be led to believe that their only avenue for relief\nif they desire to contest the reinstatement order would be to make . . .

Douglas, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n All three judges today agree that Ismael Adan Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of fundamental unfairness under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he suffered no prejudice. This alone necessitates\naffirmance. But the majority opinion nevertheless wades into a discussion of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2) and \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process requirement. I disagree with its\nanalysis in this respect and therefore dissent in part.\n I\n As one of three statutorily imposed limitations on collateral attack of\nan underlying removal order, \u00a7 1326(d)(2) requires that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nshow that \u201cthe deportation proceedings at which the order was issued\nimproperly deprived [him] of the opportunity for judicial review.\u201d 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2). The \u201cproceedings\u201d at issue here amounted to an immigration\nagent serving Ortiz-Rodriguez with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order (\u201cNotice of Intent\u201d) and obtaining his\nsignature on that form, thus subjecting Ortiz-Rodriguez to expedited\nremoval. The basis for his expedited removal was a 2017 Texas conviction\nfor evading arrest or detention with a vehicle, Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7 38.04(b)(2)(A), which qualified as an aggravated felony at that time. See 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1228 (permitting expedited removal proceedings for an\nundocumented immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony).\n Although Ortiz-Rodriguez concedes that he could have sought judicial\nreview of his expedited removal, he purportedly waived his right to seek such\nreview. According to Ortiz-Rodriguez, however, such waiver was neither\nconsidered nor intelligent, thereby depriving him of a meaningful\nopportunity for judicial review. See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S.\n828, 840 (1987); see also United States v. Hernandez Velasquez, 120 F.4th\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 30 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n1294, 1297 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[T]he burden rests with the defendant to show\nthat the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d).\n Relevant here, a portion of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s Notice of Intent reads:\n\nAs shown, Ortiz-Rodriguez did not check the first or second checkbox\nindicating that he wished to contest his removal. Nor did he check any of the\nthree checkboxes providing factual bases for contesting his removal: (1) that\nhe is a citizen or national of the United States; (2) that he is a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States; or (3) that he was not convicted of\nthe criminal offense described in the form (i.e., the evading-arrest\nconviction). Also left unchecked was the final box indicating whether he was\nattaching any supporting documentation.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez did, however, check a box on the form that stated: \u201cI\nDo Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding of Removal.\u201d He\nalso checked a box admitting to the allegations and charge listed in the Notice\nof Intent, admitting that he was deportable, and waiving his right to rebut and\ncontest the charges.\n True enough, it seems Ortiz-Rodriguez agreed to waive his right to\ncontest removal. Yet Ortiz-Rodriguez contends that the Notice of Intent\neffectively confined his ability to contest his removability to the three limited\ngrounds provided in the checkboxes, thereby leading him to believe he could\nnot challenge the determination that he had been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony. Those three checkboxes offer only factual grounds for contesting\nremoval, and a legal challenge to the aggravated-felony classification of his\nevading-arrest conviction plainly does not fall within any of the enumerated\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 31 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\noptions. Ortiz-Rodriguez therefore asserts that by presenting a finite set of\nselections, the Notice of Intent delusively suggested that he could only\ncontest his removability on those factual grounds.\n The majority disagrees with Ortiz-Rodriguez for two reasons. See ante\nat 10\u201311. First, the majority highlights that the Notice of Intent elsewhere\nreflected Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s right to petition to the appropriate court of\nappeals. Specifically, it points to a portion of the form informing Ortiz-\nRodriguez of his right to \u201cfile a petition for review of this order to the\nappropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d That portion of the form is not\ninconsistent with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s understanding of the checkboxes: read\ntogether, one could reasonably believe that he has a right to petition for\nreview, but only on the three factual grounds identified by the checkboxes.\nSee United States v. Cortez-Zepeda, No. 24-50418, 2025 WL 1904482, at *5\n(5th Cir. July 10, 2025) (unpublished) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (\u201cLogically,\nthe form\u2019s delineated reasons for filing an appeal should explain how a\ndefendant . . . can pursue the appeal described on the first page of the\nform.\u201d).\n Second, the majority notes that the form did not state that Ortiz-\nRodriguez could only raise factual challenges. But neither did it say that\nOrtiz-Rodriguez could raise legal challenges. And the Notice of Intent\u2019s\nsilence in this respect is hardly determinative of whether Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nwaiver was considered and intelligent. If anything, the form\u2019s lack of clarity\nlends further support to Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument.\n Although omitted from the majority opinion\u2019s reasoning, I wish to\ntouch upon one point raised by the Government during oral argument: that\nthe fourth checkbox indicating the attachment of supporting documentation\nserves as a general \u201ccatch-all\u201d option for contesting removability. Oral Arg.\n18:33\u201319:00. By the Government\u2019s telling, that checkbox offered Ortiz-\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 32 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nRodriguez an exhaustive basis upon which he could contest removal for any\nreason not expressly listed in the three preceding checkboxes, including a\nlegal challenge to the aggravated felony classification. The plain language of\nthat checkbox does not support this interpretation. Although indented in line\nwith the three other checkboxes, the fourth checkbox is substantively\ndistinct. It does not provide an additional reason for contestation; instead, it\nsimply indicates that a contesting party should mark that box in addition to\nany of the three superseding checkboxes when he wishes to attach supporting\ndocumentation.\n By way of example, a party contesting removal based on citizenship\nwould mark the box that reads, \u201cI am a citizen or national of the United\nStates,\u201d and, if they attach documentation like a birth or naturalization\ncertificate supporting that challenge, they may also mark the fourth checkbox\nto indicate as much. This comports with the italicized text preceding the four\ncheckboxes that says, \u201cAttach any supporting documentation.\u201d And\nregardless, it can hardly be said that \u201cattaching documents\u201d logically\nsuggests to a potential petitioner that he may raise a legal challenge. If\nintended to be a true \u201ccatch-all\u201d option as the Government suggests, there\nare a myriad of ways to more clearly provide for such an option (e.g., \u201cOther\u201d\nfollowed by a blank space to write in the basis for the challenge would surely\nbetter achieve this purpose).\n The majority opinion also makes much of the \u201cother options\u201d Ortiz-\nRodriguez had when presented with the Notice of Intent, including that he\ncould have left the waiver box unchecked. Ante at 14\u201315. That he did not do\nso, the majority suggests, somehow validates his waiver. In so doing, the\nmajority opinion glosses over the very core of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument:\nthat the \u201cchoices\u201d the form presented were misleading and, therefore, his\ndecision to check the waiver box was neither considered nor intelligent.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 33 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nAlthough Ortiz-Rodriguez was not \u201cforced to check\u201d the waiver box, that\nalone says nothing about the validity of his waiver.\n Additionally, Ortiz-Rodriguez is not alone in claiming confusion\nstemming from the Notice of Intent\u2019s limited checkboxes. Indeed, this court\ngrappled with the identical issue in a recently decided unpublished decision.\nSee Cortez-Zepeda, 2025 WL 1904482, at *3\u20134; see also id. at *4\u20135 (Dennis,\nJ., dissenting). And as the majority here acknowledges, ante at 11\u201312, the\nNinth Circuit addressed an equally misleading Notice of Intent in United\nStates v. Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2017), overruled on other\ngrounds by Alfred v. Garland, 64 F.4th 1025, 1048 (9th Cir. 2023) (en banc).\nOne question before the Valdivia-Flores court was whether the Notice of\nIntent established that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s waiver of his right to pursue a\njudicial appeal was considered and intelligent. Id. at 1206. The Ninth Circuit\nheld that it did not and, thus, the waiver did not comport with due process.\nSee id. In reaching its conclusion, the court highlighted that the Notice of\nIntent \u201cdid not include an option to contest the classification of the\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and the only check box relevant to the\nconviction itself only allowed Valdivia-Flores to contest that he \u2018was not\nconvicted of the criminal offense described.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1206. Indeed, the Ninth\nCircuit recognized that the Notice of Intent confined Valdivia-Flores to same\nthree fact-based challenges to his removal provided in Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nNotice of Intent. Id. at 1204.\n In distinguishing Valdivia-Flores, the majority opinion places great\nweight on the differing evidentiary approaches among our circuits. Ante at\n12\u201313. But even accounting for these differences, Valdivia-Flores addresses\nthe crux of the issue presented here today: a fundamentally misleading and\ndeficient form. Moreover, Ortiz-Rodriguez, like Valdivia-Flores, was not\nrepresented by legal counsel when he read and signed the Notice of Intent.\nAnd given the expedited nature of his removal proceedings, Ortiz-Rodriguez\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 34 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u201cnever had the benefit of appearing before an immigration judge, who, [ ]\npresume[ably], would have adequately conveyed both his appeal options and\nthe finality associated with waiving appeal.\u201d Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d at\n1206 (citation modified). Thus, against this backdrop, and coupled with the\nform\u2019s misleading language, I would hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s waiver of\nthe right to seek judicial review was not considered and intelligent.\n II\n The majority opinion also concludes that Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\ndemonstrate that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair\nunder \u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he (1) received procedural due process and\n(2) suffered no prejudice. Ante at 17\u201326. I agree with the latter\ndetermination, as Ortiz-Rodriguez cannot show that he would not have been\nsubject to deportation but for the alleged defect in his deportation\nproceedings. United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, 186 F.3d 651, 658\u201359 (5th\nCir. 1999). But I diverge with respect to the conclusion that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nreceived procedural due process.\n As an initial matter, the majority opinion rejects Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nargument that where a prior expedited removal order was premised on a\nconviction that was later found not to be an aggravated felony, the defendant\nhas established both that his due process rights were violated and that he\nsuffered actual prejudice. Ante at 17\u201319. I agree that our court\u2019s precedent\ndictates that removal under these circumstances does not obviate a\ndefendant\u2019s need to prove actual prejudice. See United States v. Ramirez-\nCortinas, 945 F.3d 286, 291\u201393 (5th Cir. 2019). 1 However, I would find that\n\n_____________________\n According to Ortiz-Rodriguez and the majority opinion, see ante at 17\u201318, this\ncourt\u2019s precedent stands in contrast to the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit in United\nStates v. Martinez, 786 F.3d 1227, 1230 (9th Cir. 2015) (\u201cWhere a prior removal order is\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 35 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\na due process violation necessarily occurs when, as here, the defendant was\nremoved via expedited proceedings predicated upon a conviction since\nrecognized not to qualify as an aggravated felony. See United States v.\nAlvarez, 60 F.4th 554, 558 (9th Cir. 2023) (holding that a defendant \u201ccan\nshow that his due process rights were violated by defects in his deportation\nproceeding if he shows that his underlying state conviction was not, in fact,\nan aggravated felony.\u201d).\n With due respect to my colleagues, the cases cited in the majority\nopinion do not support its contrary conclusion. See ante at 18\u201319. In United\nStates v. Parrales-Guzman, 922 F.3d 706 (5th Cir. 2019), we held that\n\u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s bar on collateral attacks attached despite the defendant\u2019s\nremoval order having rested on an unconstitutionally vague statute. Id. at\n707\u201308. Ortiz-Rodriguez does not question that holding. Indeed, Ortiz-\nRodriguez does not argue that he need not satisfy \u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s requirements\ngenerally or \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirements specifically. He merely asserts that\nbecause the Department of Homeland Security classified his evading arrest\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and that conviction was later held not to\nqualify as such, he has sufficiently established both a violation of due process\nand actual prejudice, thereby satisfying \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirement of\nfundamental unfairness. And in Parrales-Guzman, we expressly declined to\nconsider \u00a7 1326(d)(3), holding only that the defendant\u2019s collateral attack\nfailed because he did not exhaust administrative remedies as required by\n _____________________\npremised on the commission of an aggravated felony, a defendant who shows that the crime\nof which he was previously convicted was not, in fact, an aggravated felony, has established\nboth that his due process rights were violated and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d).\nBut more recent decisions from that court seemingly align with our requirement of an\nindependent showing of actual prejudice. See, e.g., United States v. Orozco-Orozco, 94 F.4th\n1118, 1128 (9th Cir. 2024) (holding that a defendant whose removal was based on a\nconviction that did not constitute an aggravated felony had established that the order of\nremoval was defective but \u201cmust [also] show that the defect prejudiced him\u201d).\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 36 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u00a7 1326(d)(1). Id. at 707\u201308, 708 n.1. So, contrary to the majority\u2019s reading\nof that case, we had no occasion to consider the \u201cidentical argument\u201d raised\nby Ortiz-Rodriguez. Ante at 18.\n Our decision in United States v. Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d 286,\nlikewise offers no insight into whether a due process violation has occurred.\nWe held in that case that a defendant whose prior removal was based on a\nconviction no longer deemed an aggravated felony must demonstrate actual\nprejudice under \u00a7 1326(d)(3). Id. at 292\u201393. In other words, \u201c[i]f despite the\nalleged errors, the proceeding could not have yielded a different result,\u201d the\ndefendant\u2019s collateral attack fails for lack of actual prejudice. Id. at 292\n(citation modified). But nothing in Ramirez-Cortinas suggests that the same\nis true for the due process requirement of \u00a7 1326(d)(3); because the\ndefendant failed to show actual prejudice, we did not reach the issue of\nwhether the defendant\u2019s due process rights had been violated.\n The majority opinion\u2019s reliance upon United States v. Palomar-\nSantiago, 593 U.S. 321, 327 (2021), is equally misplaced. There, the Court\nunanimously rejected the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit \u201cthat\ndefendants are excused from proving the first two requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)\nif they were not convicted of an offense that made them removable.\u201d Id. at\n326 (citation modified). The Court reasoned that such a rule allowing an\nundocumented immigrant to circumvent the normal review process when\nthere was a substantive error in the removal order made little sense \u201cif\nfurther administrative review, and then judicial review if necessary, could fix\nthat very error.\u201d Id. at 328. Highlighting the statute\u2019s conjunctive language,\nthe Court held that \u00a7 1326(d) makes clear that its requirements are\n\u201cmandatory,\u201d id. at 326 (quoting Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016));\nthus, the procedural requirements of administrative exhaustion and\ndeprivation of judicial review \u201care not satisfied just because a noncitizen was\nremoved for an offense that did not in fact render him removable,\u201d id. at 327.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 37 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nThe majority opinion extends the Court\u2019s reasoning in Palomar-\nSantiago to \u00a7 1326(d)(3), noting that like \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2), the\nfundamental fairness prong presents \u201c\u2018a question of procedure,\u2019 not\nsubstance.\u201d Ante at 19 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d 225,\n230 (5th Cir. 2002)). Perhaps even more telling is the Court\u2019s unequivocal\nstatement that \u201cdefendants must meet all three\u201d prerequisites of \u00a7 1326(d).\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 326. Again, Ortiz-Rodriguez does not dispute\nthis point. The question he presents is whether he has satisfied those\nmandatory prerequisites for collateral attack of his removal order. The\nPalomar-Santiago Court did not consider that question because \u201cthe narrow\nquestion th[e] Court granted certiorari to decide\u201d asked only whether the\ndefendant was \u201cexcused from\u201d satisfying the first two statutory\nrequirements of \u00a7 1326(d). Id. at 323, 328 n.4.\n What is evident from Palomar-Santiago is that the substantive error of\nwhich Ortiz-Rodriguez complains\u2014that his removal order was premised on\na conviction later found not to be a removable aggravated felony offense\u2014\nneither excuses nor satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2). See id.\nat 327 (\u201cIndeed, the substantive validity of the removal order is quite distinct\nfrom whether the noncitizen exhausted his administrative remedies . . . or\nwas deprived of the opportunity for judicial review . . . .\u201d). The Court\u2019s\nreasoning similarly applies to the actual prejudice requirement of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3): one who is otherwise deportable suffers no prejudice from\nremoval predicated on a conviction that no longer qualifies as an aggravated\nfelony, so that error in felony classification alone does not prove actual\nprejudice. See Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d at 239.\n The same, however, is not true of \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process\nrequirement. When, as here, a defendant\u2019s removal order was premised\nupon a conviction later determined not to be an aggravated felony, that error\nrenders the order defective. See Alvarez, 60 F.4th at 558. Such defects in the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 38 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nunderlying deportation proceeding, in turn, show that defendant\u2019s due\nprocess rights were violated. See id. (holding that due process violations\noccur from defects in underlying deportation proceedings); United States v.\nGuzman, 998 F.3d 562, 566\u201367 (4th Cir. 2021) (same); United States v.\nEstrada, 876 F.3d 885, 887 (6th Cir. 2017) (same). This is so because absent\nthat aggravated felony classification, the defendant would not have been\nsubject to expedited removal proceedings. Instead, the defendant would\nhave had the opportunity to appear before an immigration judge and proffer\ndefenses and, if unsuccessful, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 324. But those processes are unavailable in\nexpedited removal proceedings. Therefore, by subjecting the defendant to\nexpedited removal based upon an error in felony classification, it cannot be\nsaid that \u201cthe administrative deportation procedures . . . afforded [the\ndefendant] the unimpeded opportunity to claim all the procedural due\nprocess to which he was constitutionally entitled.\u201d Benitez-Villafuerte, 186\nF.3d at 657. For these reasons, I would also hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez has\nshown a violation of his due process rights.\n\n38"

Ct. No. 19-CIV-\n CALIFORNIA INSURANCE 06531)\n COMPANY,\n Defendant and\n Appellant.\n\nInsurance Code section 1011 requires a superior court to\nappoint the California Insurance Commissioner (commissioner)\nas the conservator of an insurance company if the insurer,\n\u201cwithout first obtaining the consent in writing of the\ncommissioner, . . . has entered into any transaction the effect of\nwhich is to merge, consolidate, or reinsure substantially its entire\nproperty or business in or with the property or business of any\n\fother person.\u201d (Ins. Code, 1 \u00a7 1011, subd. (c) (section 1011(c)).)\nCalifornia Insurance Company (CIC or CIC I) attempted, without\nthe commissioner\u2019s consent, to merge with a newly-formed New\nMexico corporation, California Insurance Company II, Inc.\n(CIC II), to redomesticate in that state. The trial court therefore\ngranted the commissioner\u2019s application to be appointed as CIC\u2019s\nconservator. Several years later, the trial court approved and\nadopted the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan that specified the\nterms for ending the conservatorship.\n CIC now appeals, arguing the conservatorship was\nunlawfully imposed and should have been vacated. CIC also\ncontends the trial court abused its discretion in approving the\nrehabilitation plan because the plan requires CIC to settle\ncertain litigation against CIC by its policyholders. CIC further\nobjects to a provision in the plan requiring that CIC\u2019s California\npolicies be reinsured and assumed by another company, and, if\nthe reinsurer is affiliated with CIC, that the reinsurer use an\nindependent third-party administrator. We find no merit in\nCIC\u2019s arguments and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n BACKGROUND\n CIC provides worker\u2019s compensation insurance to\nbusinesses. Eighty-five percent of its business is in California.\n Most worker\u2019s compensation insurance consists of\nguaranteed cost policies, under which the policyholder pays the\nsame premium rate regardless of the amount of claims ultimately\n\n1 Undesignated statutory citations are to the Insurance\n\nCode.\n\ffiled under the policy. Another type of policy is a retrospective\nrating plan, under which the premium a policyholder owes is\nadjusted after the end of the policy period, within minimum and\nmaximum levels, based on the amount of losses during the policy\nperiod. (The Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Lara (2022)\n84 Cal.App.5th 1119, 1125.) Because the premium changes based\non the amount of losses, a retrospective rating plan returns some\nrisk to the policyholder. Only large employers can qualify for\nretrospective rating plans because smaller employers are\npresumed to be less sophisticated insurance consumers and less\nable to predict their future losses.\n Retrospective rating plans are issued through an\nendorsement to a guaranteed cost policy. (See The Travelers\nIndemnity Co. v. Lara, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.)\nCalifornia law prohibits an insurer from issuing a worker\u2019s\ncompensation policy or endorsement unless the insurer files a\ncopy of the form or endorsement with a rating organization, the\nWorkers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau, which in turn\npasses it on to the commissioner for approval. (\u00a7 11658,\nsubd. (a).)\n I. EquityComp and Ensuing Litigation\n In 2011, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Steven\nMenzies, together with others, patented a \u201cReinsurance\nParticipation Agreement\u201d (RPA). The RPA was designed to allow\nan insurer to offer a retrospective rating policy to small and\nmedium-sized companies. The RPA would accomplish this by\nhaving an employer take out a guaranteed cost policy, then the\n\finsurer would cede some of the insured risk to a reinsurer, such\nas a captive reinsurer, together with a portion of the premium.\nThe reinsurer would then enter into a side agreement with the\npolicyholder to cede some of that risk back to the policyholder. At\nthe end of the policy period, the reinsurer would refund some of\nthe premiums to the policyholder if the losses were lower than\nexpected or charge the policyholder more if the losses were\nhigher.\n Under a program called EquityComp, CIC followed this\ntemplate and issued guaranteed cost policies that had been\nsubmitted to the rating organization for the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. CIC had its affiliate, Applied Underwriters Captive\nReinsurance Assurance Company (AUCRA), reinsure some of the\nrisk and issue the side agreements to the policyholders, which\nwere not submitted for the commissioner\u2019s approval. An actuary\nemployed by the California Department of Insurance\n(department) opined that CIC\u2019s rates on the standard form policy\nwere on the order of 33 percent higher than the industry average.\n Beginning in 2012, 68 EquityComp policyholders filed\nvarious claims or actions challenging the RPA. In a 2016 ruling\nin one of those challenges, the commissioner found that the RPA\nconstituted a misapplication of CIC\u2019s filed rates in violation of\nsection 11737. (Matter of Shasta Linen Supply, Inc., Insurance\nCommissioner (June 22, 2016) No. AHB-WCA-14-31 (Shasta\nLinen).) The commissioner\u2019s Shasta Linen decision declared that\nCIC\u2019s failure to file and secure approval of the RPA as required\nby section 11658 rendered it void as a matter of law.\n\f CIC petitioned for review of Shasta Linen in Los Angeles\nSuperior Court, and in 2017 the parties settled their dispute.\nThe parties agreed they had a good faith dispute about whether\nthe RPA was void as a matter of law and the remedy authorized\nby the Insurance Code. A recital to the agreement stated that\nthis dispute was \u201cultimately for the courts to decide.\u201d CIC and\nthe department further agreed that the Shasta Linen decision\nwas precedential in administrative proceedings before the\ndepartment, the department had approved an amended RPA with\nadditional disclosures, CIC would not change the amended RPA\nwithout submitting it to the department for review and approval,\nand CIC would dismiss its writ petition. One paragraph of the\nsettlement agreement declared that nothing in it \u201climit[ed] the\npower of the Commissioner to initiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d No employers in California bought any\nEquityComp policies containing the amended RPA after the\nsettlement.\n Litigation on the other RPA claims and actions\npolicyholders had filed against CIC continued in California\ncourts, federal courts, administrative proceedings before the\ncommissioner, and in arbitration. CIC succeeded in defeating\nclass certification motions. (E.g., National Convention Services,\nLLC v. Applied Underwriters Capital Risk Assurance Co.\n(S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2019, No. 15cv7063) 2019 WL 3409882, at *1;\n\fShasta Linen Supply, Inc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (E.D.Cal.\nApr. 17, 2019, Nos. 2:16-cv-158-WBS AC, 2:16-cv-1211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 3244487, at *2.) One federal court granted CIC and its\naffiliates summary judgment on claims that the RPA violated the\nUnfair Competition Law because it was void. (Pet Food Express,\nLtd. v. AUI (E.D.Cal. Sept. 12, 2019, No. 2:16-cv-01211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 4318584, at *2, *4.)\n In other actions, federal district courts ruled that\npolicyholders were liable for premiums due under CIC\u2019s standard\nform guaranteed cost insurance policies even though the RPA\nwas void or regardless of whether it was void. (E.g., Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb. Aug. 2, 2018,\nNo. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4 [granting summary\njudgment on premiums due under guaranteed cost policy without\ndeciding whether RPA was void].) Ten administrative decisions\nby the commissioner likewise declared the RPA to be void and\nunlawful but affirmed the legality of CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npolicies. In California courts, this court and two other appellate\ncourts held that CIC\u2019s failure to file the RPA or related\nagreement with the commissioner rendered the arbitration\nagreement contained within the RPA or related agreement void\nas a matter of law. (Jackpot Harvesting, Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 719, 738; Luxor Cabs,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (2018)\n30 Cal.App.5th 970, 976\u2013977 (Luxor Cabs); Nielsen Contracting,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1096,\n1113\u20131114 (Nielsen Contracting).) Many trial courts before and\n\fafter these decisions likewise held that the RPA\u2019s arbitration\nprovision or the RPA in its entirety was void or invalid. Two\narbitrators found the RPA to be valid, one made no ruling on its\nlegality, one did not rule on its legality under section 11658 but\nfound it contained misrepresentations and was unconscionable,\none found the RPA should have been filed but that the\npolicyholder did not have a private right of action to enforce that\nrequirement, and seven found the RPA to be invalid in whole or\nin part. Some of those arbitrators awarded damages to the\npolicyholder. One of those seven, like the federal decisions,\nissued an award requiring the policyholder to pay premiums due\nto CIC under the guaranteed cost policy. Many cases have yet to\nbe fully resolved because of a stay in connection with the\ninitiation of the conservatorship at issue here.\n II. Menzies Acquisition and Attempted Merger\n As of January 2019, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire\nHathaway) indirectly owned 81 percent of CIC and its affiliates.\nBerkshire Hathaway agreed that month to sell its shares to\nMenzies, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, who already\nowned 11.5 percent of the company. The agreement allowed\nBerkshire Hathaway to retain a $50 million breakup fee if the\ntransaction did not close by September 30, 2019.\n As required by section 1215.2, subdivision (a), in April 2019\nMenzies submitted an application to the department for approval\nof the transaction. The application informed the commissioner of\nthe breakup fee and transaction deadline. The commissioner had\n60 days to act on the application. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d).) After the\n\fcommissioner found Menzies\u2019 first two applications insufficient\nand Menzies withdrew them, Menzies submitted a third\napplication on September 7, 2019.\n On September 13, 2019, the department sent CIC various\nfollow-up questions, including a question about CIC\u2019s total\nliability in pending litigation. CIC responded that it was\ndefending 50 cases and its total liability was $50 million. CIC at\nthe time had $1.1 billion in assets, $615 million in capital and\nsurplus, and $240 million on deposit with the department. On\nSeptember 19 and 24, 2019, the department asked follow-up\nquestions on other matters, to which CIC promptly responded.\nOn September 27, 2019, the department informed CIC that it\ncould neither approve nor disapprove CIC\u2019s application by\nSeptember 30 because it had numerous remaining questions\nabout the pending litigation\u2019s financial impact on CIC.\n Berkshire Hathaway required CIC to pay $10 million for an\nextension of the transaction deadline until October 10, 2019.\nMenzies then proposed and the New Mexico Office of the\nSuperintendent of Insurance agreed to hold an expedited\napproval process to re-domesticate CIC in New Mexico by\nmerging CIC into a newly formed New Mexico corporation, CIC\nII. On October 9, 2019, a department attorney participated in a\nconfidential meeting of New Mexico, Texas, and California\ninsurance regulators. Later the same day, the New Mexico\nsuperintendent of insurance held a hearing on CIC\u2019s merger\napplication. Department representatives monitored the hearing\nby phone. A New Mexico official testified that after the meeting\n\fearlier that day, she was aware of objections from other\nregulators. The New Mexico superintendent approved the\nmerger, conditioned on the stock transactions between Menzies\nand Berkshire Hathaway closing by October 10, 2019, and CIC II\nimmediately afterwards filing articles of merger with the New\nMexico Secretary of State. The New Mexico order required CIC\nII to assume liability for all of CIC\u2019s issued policies and maintain\nits $240 million deposit with the department.\n In a press release after the hearing, the New Mexico Office\nof the Superintendent of Insurance announced that during the\npre-meeting call the department had failed to articulate any basis\nfor denying the proposed merger under New Mexico law and had\nsaid that the proposed merger presented no risks to California\npolicyholders. However, the department representatives said\nafterwards that they had never made the latter statement. The\npress release also said that no one in attendance at the hearing\noffered any objection to the merger. The department\nrepresentatives later said they did not register an objection\nduring the hearing because the issue in the hearing was whether\nto approve a transaction under New Mexico law, which was an\nissue for the New Mexico regulator.\n Later on the day of the hearing, Berkshire Hathaway\nnotified the department that, based on the lack of objections at\nthe hearing, it intended to close the sale to Menzies on October\n10, 2019. On the same day, the department notified CIC that if\nthe merger was completed without the commissioner\u2019s approval,\nCIC would be in violation of California law. Post-merger, CIC\n\fwould cease to exist, and CIC II, as an unlicensed insurer, would\nbe precluded from transacting the business of insurance in\nCalifornia until it became admitted. 2 The department did not\nrespond to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s letter, and its transaction with\nMenzies closed.\n CIC II satisfied the New Mexico superintendent\u2019s\nconditions for approval, so the merger of CIC with CIC II would\nbe completed by filing a certificate of merger with the California\nSecretary of State. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) On October\n22, 2019, the department asked CIC by telephone not to file the\ncertificate of merger with the California Secretary of State so\nthat the parties could meet and resolve their issues. CIC agreed,\nbut the parties never met.\n III. Conservatorship\n On November 4, 2019, without notice to CIC, the\ncommissioner filed an ex parte application to be appointed\nconservator of CIC. The application relied on section 1011(c),\nwhich requires a court to appoint the commissioner as\nconservator of an insurance company if the commissioner shows\nthe company has, without the commissioner\u2019s consent,\ntransferred or attempted to transfer substantially its entire\n\n2 A company is \u201cadmitted\u201d to transact a class of insurance\n\nby obtaining a certificate of authority from the commissioner.\n(\u00a7 700, subd. (a).) Before issuing a certificate of authority, the\ncommissioner must consider the applicant\u2019s qualifications with\nrespect to, among other things, capital and surplus, financial\nstability, and reinsurance, as well as the \u201ccompetency, character,\nand integrity of management\u201d and the \u201cfairness and honesty of\nmethods of doing business.\u201d (\u00a7 717.)\n\fbusiness or entered into a transaction to merge. The\ncommissioner alleged CIC violated this provision by attempting\nto merge with CIC II without the commissioner\u2019s approval under\nsection 1215.2, subdivision (a). The commissioner further alleged\nthat providing notice of the application to CIC would have been\nprejudicial because CIC could have completed the merger by\nfiling the certificate of merger. The trial court issued the\nrequested order the same day.\n In January 2020, CIC moved to vacate the conservatorship\norder, arguing, among other things, that the conservatorship was\nunnecessary because CIC consented to an injunction against the\nmerger pending the commissioner\u2019s approval. In August 2020,\nthe trial court denied CIC\u2019s motion. CIC challenged the order by\nfiling a petition for writ of mandate in this court in October 2020,\nbut this court summarily denied CIC\u2019s petition. (Cal. Ins. Co. v.\nSuperior Court (Nov. 25, 2020, A161049).) CIC II and an affiliate\nof CIC filed federal actions seeking to vacate the conservatorship\nand enjoin it. (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n530 F.Supp.3d 914; California Ins. Co. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n547 F.Supp.3d 908.) The district courts dismissed both suits, and\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara (9th Cir. 2022) 37 F.4th 579, 600.)\n IV. Rehabilitation Plan\n In October 2020, the commissioner filed an application for\napproval of a rehabilitation plan, which would end the\nconservatorship. Two aspects of the plan are relevant here.\n\f Section 2.2 of the plan would require CIC and AUCRA to\nenter into an \u201cAssumption Reinsurance and Administration\nAgreement\u201d to allow an insurer admitted in California to reinsure\nand assume all of CIC\u2019s California policies and liabilities to\npolicyholders. Under this provision of the plan, the commissioner\nwould solicit bids and select the reinsurer. If the commissioner\nwere to select an affiliate of CIC as the reinsurer, that reinsurer\nwould have to hire an independent third-party administrator for\nclaims administration. Upon the effective date of the assumption\nand reinsurance agreement, the commissioner as CIC\u2019s\nconservator would effectuate the merger of CIC into CIC II,\nthereby redomesticating CIC in New Mexico, and cancel CIC\u2019s\ncertificate of authority to transact business in California.\n Section 2.6 concerns the pending litigation against CIC.\nSection 2.6 incorporated by reference schedule 2.6, which sets out\nthree options under which CIC and AUCRA would offer to settle\nthe litigation against them. Option 1 would allow policyholders\nto renounce the RPA and obtain restitution of any amounts they\npaid CIC over the cost of the guaranteed cost policy premiums.\nOption 2 would allow policyholders to renounce the RPA and\nobtain restitution of any amounts they paid over the cost of a\nstandard, approved retrospective rating plan at the time of the\npolicy\u2019s inception. And option 3 would allow policyholders to\nratify the RPA and accept liability under it. CIC\u2019s liability to any\nclaimant who did not accept one of the settlement options would\npass to the reinsurer under the reinsurance and assumption\n\fagreement, and the conservator would set aside a reserve amount\nto cover those claims.\n CIC opposed the settlement provision in section 2.6 of the\nplan. It did not object to the reinsurance and assumption\nprovision in section 2.2, so long as its affiliate Continental\nIndemnity Company (Continental) had the right to match any\nother company\u2019s offer for CIC\u2019s California policies and the\ncommissioner dropped the requirement that an affiliate reinsurer\nuse an independent third-party administrator for claims\nhandling.\n The trial court approved the plan in April 2024. CIC\nappealed and also filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging\nthe approval of the plan. This court summarily denied the\npetition in a one-paragraph order, noting that CIC had failed to\ndemonstrate that its remedy on appeal was inadequate. (Cal.\nIns. Co. v. Superior Court (June 20, 2024, A170573).)\n DISCUSSION\n I. Appealability\n An order approving a rehabilitation plan for an insurer\nunder a conservatorship is appealable under section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Quackenbush\nv. Mission Ins. Co. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 458, 461, fn. 1, citing\nCode Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(1) & Carpenter v. Pacific Mut.\nLife Ins. Co. (1937) 10 Cal.2d 307, 322\u2013323 (Carpenter).)\n The commissioner disputes this and urges us to treat the\nappeal as a writ proceeding. He asserts that a conservatorship\nproceeding under Insurance Code section 1011 is a special\n\fproceeding to which section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure\ndoes not apply. He points out that section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) is contained in Part 2 of that code and that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court \u201clong ago held that Part 2 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure extends generally only to civil \u2018actions,\u2019 and not\nto \u2018special proceedings.\u2019 \u201d (Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.\nTex-Cal Land Management, Inc. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707.) That\nremark, however, concerned the applicability of the appellate\nstay provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 916 et seq. (Tex-\nCal, at pp. 706\u2013707.) In the same case, the California Supreme\nCourt also observed that \u201c[i]t has long been established that the\nstatutory right of appeal of final judgments and orders extends\neven to \u2018special proceedings [including] those intended to be\nsummary in nature\u2019 unless the Legislature has expressly\nprohibited an appeal in the particular case.\u201d (Id. at p. 705.)\nConsistent with this statement is Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at\npages 322\u2013323, which entertained an appeal from an order\napproving a rehabilitation plan and held that the appeal\nencompassed all preliminary orders that preceded it.\n The commissioner fears that aggrieved parties in\nconservation proceedings will assert a right to immediate appeal\nfrom different types of rulings, including procedural orders and\nevidentiary findings, which will create confusion and delay. We\ndo not hold that any conservation-related order is appealable,\nmerely that the rehabilitation plan order that will resolve the\n\fconservation is appealable. 3 The commissioner also suggests that\nthe approval of the rehabilitation plan does not determine all of\nCIC\u2019s rights, since the commissioner will still periodically require\njudicial orders relating to implementation of the plan. But\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 323, noted that a proceeding\nfor a conservatorship of an insurer lasts \u201cuntil the proposed plan\nis ultimately passed upon.\u201d In addition, a final judgment is a\ndetermination that \u201c \u2018 \u201cterminates the litigation between the\nparties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done\nbut to enforce by execution what has been determined.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 288, 304.) The\norder approving the rehabilitation plan fits this description, since\nthe only thing remaining after that order is the execution of the\nplan, at the end of which CIC will merge with CIC II and cease to\nexist as an independent entity. We therefore agree with CIC that\nthe order approving the rehabilitation plan is appealable, and we\n\n3 In particular, interim orders involving the conservator\u2019s\n\nmanagement of the conserved insurer would likely not be\nappealable. For example, in this case CIC moved to modify the\nconservatorship order and to vacate the conservatorship. CIC\nnoted in its petition for writ of mandate challenging those orders\nthat they were not appealable. Similarly, an order allowing\ndiscovery, like the one the trial court entered here, or an order\napproving the commissioner\u2019s fixing of expenses of\nconservatorship, to be paid out of the assets of the conserved\ninsurer (\u00a7 1035, subd. (a)), would likely not be appealable under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(1). Any\nchallenge to such orders would have to be pursued by writ\npetition or in an appeal from the order approving the\nrehabilitation plan or otherwise ending the conservatorship.\n\fdecline the commissioner\u2019s invitation to treat the appeal as a writ\nproceeding.\n II. Standard of Review\n The commissioner placed CIC in conservatorship and\nproposed the rehabilitation plan pursuant to authority under\nsection 1011(c). \u201cThe statutory authority he exercises in that\neffort is an aspect of the police power of the state. It is\nsubstantial in its scope, but not boundless. Its basic parameters\nwere described by our Supreme Court over [85] years ago in\nCarpenter v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, 10 Cal.2d at page\n329: \u2018The only restriction on the exercise of this power is that the\nstate\u2019s action shall be reasonably related to the public interest\nand shall not be arbitrary or improperly discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d\n(Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th\n393, 398.) As the parties here both recognize, this has been held\nto require a trial court to review a commissioner\u2019s action \u201cunder\nthe abuse of discretion standard [citation]: was the action\narbitrary, i.e., unsupported by a rational basis, or is it contrary to\nspecific statute, a breach of the fiduciary duty of the conservator\nas trustee, or improperly discriminatory?\u201d (In re Executive Life\nIns. Co. (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 344, 358.) On appeal, \u201c[w]e also\ntest the action of the trial court by the abuse of discretion\nstandard. [Citation.] In this connection we employ the\nequivalent of the substantial evidence test by accepting the trial\ncourt\u2019s resolution of credibility and conflicting substantial\nevidence, and its choice of possible reasonable inferences.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\f III. Analysis\n CIC challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of the\nconservatorship in the first place, its refusal to vacate it, and its\napproval of the rehabilitation plan that would now end it. We\nconsider each argument in turn.\n A. Imposition of the conservatorship\n CIC contends the conservatorship was unlawfully imposed\nbecause there have never been any concerns about CIC\u2019s solvency\nor financial condition. 4 CIC\u2019s argument rests on the interplay of\nsection 1011, which authorizes conservatorships of insurers, and\nsections 1215.2, 1215.10, 1215.12, and 1215.16, which concern\nacquisitions or mergers of insurers. While CIC\u2019s argument is not\ncomplicated, to follow it one must first understand the operation\nof the relevant statutes.\n Section 1011 states that the \u201csuperior court of the county in\nwhich the principal office of a person [purporting to do insurance\nbusiness] is located, upon the filing by the commissioner of the\nverified application showing any of the conditions in this\nsubdivision exist, . . . shall issue its order vesting title to all of the\nassets of that person, wheresoever situated, in the commissioner\nor his or her successor in office, in his or her official capacity, and\n\n4 The commissioner argues in a footnote that CIC cannot\n\nargue that a conservation based on an unapproved attempt to\nmerge also requires the threat of insolvency because CIC did not\nraise that issue below. We need not respond to arguments raised\nonly in a footnote. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)\n43 Cal.App.5th 404, 419 [\u201cAn appellant cannot bury a substantive\nlegal argument in a footnote and hope to avoid waiver of that\nargument.\u201d].)\n\fdirect the commissioner . . . to conduct, as conservator, the\nbusiness of the person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011; see \u00a7 1010 [conservatorship\nstatutes apply to, among others, all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state\u201d].) The list of circumstances\nsupporting a conservatorship includes \u201c[t]hat the person, without\nfirst obtaining the consent in writing of the commissioner, has\ntransferred, or attempted to transfer, substantially its entire\nproperty or business or, without consent, has entered into any\ntransaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate, or\nreinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with\nthe property or business of any other person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011(c).) It also\nincludes the circumstance \u201c[t]hat the person is found, after an\nexamination, to be in a condition that makes its further\ntransaction of business hazardous to its policyholders, or\ncreditors, or to the public.\u201d (Id., subd. (d).) The Legislature\nenacted section 1011 in 1935, and the wording of these triggering\nconditions for a conservatorship remains substantively\nunchanged since then. (Stats. 1935, ch. 145, \u00a7 1011, p. 540.)\n In 1969, the Legislature added article 4.7 to division 1, part\n2, chapter 2 of the Insurance Code and titled it the \u201cInsurance\nHolding Company System Regulatory Act.\u201d (Stats. 1969,\nch. 1275, \u00a7 1, pp. 2487\u20132488.) As relevant here, section 1215.2,\nsubdivision (a) states, \u201cA person shall not make a tender offer for,\nor a request or invitation for tenders of, or enter into an\nagreement to exchange securities for or acquire in the open\nmarket, any voting security, or any security convertible into a\nvoting security, of a domestic insurer or of any other person\n\fcontrolling a domestic insurer, if the other person is not\nsubstantially engaged either directly or through its affiliates in\nany businesses other than that of insurance, if, as a result of the\nconsummation thereof, the person would, directly or indirectly,\nacquire control of the insurer, and a person shall not enter into\nan agreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer, unless, at the time copies of the offer, purchase,\nrequest, or invitation are first published, sent, or given to\nsecurity holders or the agreement or transaction is entered into,\nas the case may be, the person has filed with the commissioner,\nand has sent to the insurer, a statement containing\u201d certain\ninformation. The required disclosures include the backgrounds\nand identities of everyone on whose behalf the transaction is to\nbe effected; the source of the funds to be used; and any plans or\nproposals to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or merge it.\n(\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (a)(1)\u2013(5).)\n Section 1215.2, subdivision (d) states, \u201cThe purchases,\nexchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control referred to in\nsubdivision (a) may not be made until the commissioner approves\nthe purchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of\ncontrol. The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the\ntransaction on or before the latter of 60 days after the statement\nrequired by subdivision (a) has been filed with the commissioner\nor, if a hearing is held pursuant to subdivision (f), 30 days after\nthe close of the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f).\u201d The\nstatute then lists reasons why the commissioner may disapprove\nthe transaction. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d)(1)\u2013(5).)\n\f Section 1215.10, subdivision (a) allows the commissioner to\napply for an injunction when it appears to the commissioner that\nan insurer \u201chas committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nthe Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act. Section\n1215.12 states in full, \u201cWhenever it appears to the commissioner\nthat any person has committed a violation of this article which so\nimpairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to\nthreaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business\nby it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or\nthe public, then the commissioner may proceed as provided in\nArticle 14 (commencing with Section 1010) of Chapter 1 of this\npart to take possession of the property of the domestic insurer\nand to conduct the business thereof.\u201d Finally, section 1215.16\nstates in full, \u201cAll laws and parts of laws of this state inconsistent\nwith this article are hereby superseded with respect to matters\ncovered by this article.\u201d\n CIC\u2019s argument based on these statutes takes two forms,\neach of them straightforward. CIC first argues narrowly that the\ncommissioner\u2019s conservatorship application alleged violations of\nsection 1215.2 to justify the conservatorship, so the\ncommissioner\u2019s failure to identify any financial impairment\nmeans his application did not satisfy section 1215.12\u2019s\nrequirements for a conservatorship. This is incorrect. The first\nsentence of the commissioner\u2019s application states that the\napplication rests on section 1011. The application later alleges\nrepeatedly that Menzies\u2019 attempt to merge CIC with CIC II\njustified a conservatorship under section 1011. The\n\fcommissioner unambiguously relied on his authority under\nsection 1011, not section 1215.12. The application does further\nallege that the attempted merger without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval also violated section 1215.2. But these further\nallegations do not undermine or disclaim the reliance on section\n1011, so the commissioner\u2019s application properly relied on his\nauthority under that statute.\n CIC also argues more broadly that the Legislature limited\nthe reach of section 1011(c) \u2014 which CIC terms a historic,\ngeneral statutory provision \u2014 when it enacted what CIC calls the\nspecific, remedial structure for unauthorized mergers in article\n4.7. CIC contends that by specifying in section 1215.12 that the\ncommissioner can impose a conservatorship under section 1011\nand related statutes for an unauthorized merger that \u201cso impairs\nthe financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten\ninsolvency or make the further transaction of business by it\nhazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the\npublic\u201d and enacting section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision, the\nLegislature repealed the broader authorization of\nconservatorships in section 1011(c) for any unauthorized merger.\nAccording to CIC, if an authorized merger does not so impair the\nfinancial condition of an insurer that it threatens insolvency or\nmakes the operation of the insurer hazardous, then the\ncommissioner may not impose a conservatorship and may only\npursue injunctive relief.\n We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended section\n1215.16 to expressly repeal section 1011(c), as CIC contends.\n\fMost obviously, section 1011 remains in effect; the bill that\nenacted sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 did not repeal section\n1011(c). Section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision is not to the\ncontrary. Section 1215.12 invokes the conservatorship\nproceedings under section 1010 and following sections, so the\nLegislature intended those statutes to remain in effect. It would\nbe strange for the Legislature to allow section 1011(c) to remain\nin force, authorizing a conservatorship whenever an insurer\nattempts to merge its business without permission, while\nobliquely limiting it through sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 to\nauthorize a conservatorship only when a merger creates a risk of\nfinancial impairment. It would be particularly strange to do so\nwhile leaving section 1011, subdivision (d) in effect, which\nauthorizes a conservatorship whenever an insurer is found to be\nin a hazardous condition. A far more natural method of\nachieving the purpose that CIC ascribes to the Legislature would\nhave been to add the requirement of financial impairment to\nsection 1011(c), but the Legislature did not do this.\n Although CIC protests that section 1215.16 makes this a\nquestion of express repeal, in actuality CIC\u2019s argument is one of\nimplied repeal. \u201cRepeals by implication are disfavored.\u201d (Lopez\nv. Sony Electronics, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 627, 637.)\n\u201c \u2018Notwithstanding the \u201cpresumption against repeals by\nimplication,\u201d repeal may be found where (1) \u201cthe two acts are so\ninconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation,\u201d\nor (2) \u201cthe later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent\nto supersede the earlier\u201d provision.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because \u201cthe\n\fdoctrine of implied repeal provides that the most recently enacted\nstatute expresses the will of the Legislature\u201d [citation],\napplication of the doctrine is appropriate in those limited\nsituations where it is necessary to effectuate the intent of\ndrafters of the newly enacted statute. \u201c \u2018In order for the second\nlaw to repeal or supersede the first, the former must constitute a\nrevision of the entire subject, so that the court may say that it\nwas intended to be a substitute for the first.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Wishnev v. The\nNorthwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. (2019) 8 Cal.5th 199, 211.)\n As the commissioner points out, section 1215.12 is easy to\nharmonize with section 1011(c). The conservatorship statutes,\nincluding section 1011, apply to all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1010.) Section 1011(c)\nallows for a conservatorship of an insurer based on an attempted\nmerger without requiring a showing of insolvency or financial\nhazard.\n Section 1215.12, meanwhile, applies to a broader group\nthan just insurers, but allows for conservatorships in narrower\ncircumstances. Section 1215.12 allows the commissioner to place\nan insurer in a conservatorship when it appears to the\ncommissioner that \u201cany person\u201d has violated section 1215.2 or\nother statutes in a way that impairs the financial condition of an\ninsurer that threatens insolvency or makes the insurer\u2019s further\noperation hazardous. Section 1215.2, subdivision (a), among\nother things, prohibits a \u201cperson\u201d from making a tender offer or\nrequesting or inviting tenders for securities of an insurer or a\n\u201cperson\u201d controlling an insurer, or from \u201center[ing] into an\n\fagreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer\u201d unless, when the offer, request, or agreement is\nmade, the required information has been filed with the\ncommissioner. Section 1215.2 further provides that such\n\u201cpurchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control\u201d\nmay not be made without the commissioner\u2019s approval. (Id.,\nsubd. (d).) \u201cPerson\u201d is defined for both of these sections to include\nany individual or other entity. (\u00a7 1215, subd. (m).) Because\nsection 1215.12 applies to non-insurers and prohibits anyone\nfrom even offering to buy an insurer without satisfying the\nstatutory requirements, it makes sense that the Legislature\nwould limit conservatorships based on violations of such\nrequirements to those that threaten the solvency or safe\noperation of the insurer.\n The Legislature\u2019s limitation of the scope of the remedy for\nits new requirements applicable to non-insurers does not mean\nthat it also intended to limit the scope of the existing remedy\napplicable only to insurers. When an insurer violates section\n1215.2 by agreeing to merge, as CIC did, it triggers the provision\nin section 1011(c), even if that agreement did not also trigger\nsection 1215.12 because it did not threaten the insurer\u2019s solvency\nor make its continued operation hazardous. Because sections\n1215.2 and 1215.12 are not incompatible with section 1011(c),\nevince no intent to supersede section 1011(c), and did not revise\nthe entire subject of conservatorships of insurers, but rather\nadded a more limited conservatorship remedy for a broader set of\n\factors, we hold that section 1215.2 and 1215.12 did not expressly\nor impliedly repeal section 1011(c).\n CIC contends that the commissioner has only ever invoked\nsection 1011(c) for insurers in financial distress and cites various\ncases describing section 1011 conservatorships as the state\nequivalent of bankruptcy law for insurers. (E.g., State of\nCalifornia v. Altus Finance (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1295 [\u00a7 1011\n\u201cis part of . . . article 14,\u201d which \u201crelate[s] to the Commissioner\u2019s\ntreatment of insolvent insurers\u201d and is the \u201cequivalent of federal\nbankruptcy laws\u201d]; Financial Indemnity Co. v. Superior Court of\nLos Angeles (1955) 45 Cal.2d 395, 402 [\u201cThe primary purpose for\nthe drastic remedy [of conservatorship] . . . is to prevent\ndissipation of the assets of the company after the commissioner\nhas determined that a hazardous condition exists.\u201d].)\n We agree that this case appears to be the first decision\ndealing with a conservatorship involving an insurer not in\nfinancial distress. However, the absence of a precedent directly\non point demonstrates only that before CIC, solvent insurers\nwere careful to obtain the necessary approval before placing their\nbusiness at risk of conservatorship. While the conservatorship\nsystem does replace the bankruptcy system for insurers, who are\nexcluded from federal bankruptcy, that does not mean that only\nbankrupt or insolvent insurers can be placed under\nconservatorship. As our Supreme Court explained long ago in\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 329, \u201cIt is no longer open to\nquestion that the business of insurance is affected with a public\ninterest\u201d because \u201c[i]nsurance is a public asset, a basis of credit,\n\fand a vital factor in business activity.\u201d Carpenter involved an\ninsolvent insurer, but given the role insurance plays in the\neconomy and society, the public\u2019s interest in insurers and the\ninsurance industry extends beyond insolvency to ensuring that\ninsurers follow statutes and regulations enacted to protect\npolicyholders and the public.\n The plain language of section 1011(c) permits a\nconservatorship based on an attempted unauthorized merger\neven when the insurer involved is solvent, and it is not absurd for\nthe Legislature to intend to prohibit insurers from merging\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s consent, regardless of solvency\nquestions. We therefore follow the statute\u2019s plain language.\n(People v. Velador (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 687, 693 [if statutory\nlanguage is clear, courts must follow its plain meaning unless it\nwould result in absurd consequences that the Legislature did not\nintend].)\n B. Maintenance of the conservatorship\n CIC argues that even if the commissioner properly placed\nCIC under conservatorship based only on the attempted merger,\nthe commissioner and the trial court abused their discretion by\nnot vacating the conservatorship on CIC\u2019s motion when CIC\nagreed to an injunction prohibiting it from completing the\nmerger. CIC contends its offer to stipulate to an injunction made\nthe conservatorship unnecessary. It further contends the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to vacate the injunction failed to account for\nvarious facts, including that the merger was only necessary to\nsatisfy the Berkshire Hathaway deadline after the commissioner\n\frefused to approve or disapprove Menzies\u2019 application to acquire\nCIC due to concerns about the RPA litigation. CIC also asserts\nthat the department appeared at the New Mexico merger hearing\nand did not object, CIC complied when the commissioner asked it\nnot to file the certificate with the Secretary of State to complete\nthe merger in California, the commissioner failed to raise any\nconcerns about the RPA litigation during its consideration of\nMenzies\u2019 application to acquire CIC until days before the\nBerkshire Hathaway deadline, and CIC\u2019s assets and capital were\nmore than sufficient to address the maximum exposure from the\nRPA litigation.\n We reject CIC\u2019s argument for the same reasons that the\nNinth Circuit rejected the similar argument that the\nconservatorship proceeding was brought in bad faith. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th 579.) As the Ninth\nCircuit explained, \u201cthe conservatorship action was brought for a\nlegitimate reason \u2014 indeed, [CIC\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019] own factual\nallegations make out a violation of \u00a7 1215.2(d) sufficient to\ntrigger a conservatorship under \u00a7 1011(c). The allegations make\nclear that [CIC and its affiliates] neither sought nor received\napproval from the [department] for the proposed purchase of the\ncontrolling interest in CIC I and the concomitant CIC I / CIC II\nmerger, as required by California Insurance Code \u00a7 1215.2(d),\nand that the merger was an obvious attempt to avoid the\nCalifornia insurance regulatory regime.\u201d (Id. at p. 597.) Given\nthat CIC created the RPA with the express intent of bypassing\nstate insurance regulations limiting the marketing of\n\fretrospective rating policies, the commissioner determined that\nthe RPA was unlawful and void, and that CIC attempted to\nmerge with an out-of-state entity a matter of days after the\ncommissioner raised concerns about CIC\u2019s litigation of suits\nbased on the void RPA, the commissioner could reasonably\ndetermine that it was necessary to place CIC under\nconservatorship to prevent CIC from pursuing any further\nschemes to dodge or stymie the commissioner\u2019s oversight, despite\nthe offer to stipulate to an injunction.\n The various facts that CIC cites, even if true, are beside the\npoint. Fundamentally, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, Menzies\n\u201cmade a $50 million bet with Berkshire Hathaway . . . that he\ncould complete the purchase of Berkshire [Hathaway]\u2019s\ncontrolling interest in CIC I by September 30, 2019.\u201d (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 584.) The\ndeadline was not of the commissioner\u2019s making. Menzies lost the\nbet when the commissioner failed to approve the transaction by\nthe deadline Berkshire Hathaway set. The answer, then, was for\nMenzies to pay his loss by forfeiting the breakup fee (ibid.), not\nfor Menzies and CIC to try to seek to complete the transaction\nanyway by hurriedly redomesticating CIC within less than two\nweeks by merging with a newly created out-of-state entity\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s approval. Given CIC\u2019s demonstrated\nwillingness to flout the law for its own financial gain, the trial\ncourt and by extension the commissioner did not abuse their\ndiscretion by concluding that a conservatorship was necessary to\n\fensure CIC\u2019s compliance with the law, rather than acceding to\nCIC\u2019s preferred course of a stipulated injunction.\n This case is comparable in this regard to Caminetti v.\nGuaranty Union Life Ins. Co. (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 330. The\ncommissioner there placed an insurer in conservatorship because\nthe insurer\u2019s management was paying itself excessive salaries\nthat placed the insurer in a hazardous condition. (Id. at pp. 332\u2013\n335.) The insurer later argued that the trial court should have\nterminated the conservatorship because the insurer removed the\ngrounds for the conservatorship by voluntarily reducing the\nmanagement\u2019s salaries. (Id. at pp. 335\u2013336.) The Court of\nAppeal noted that the same management remained in control\nand found that the trial court or commissioner would only be\nwarranted in returning the company back to the management\u2019s\ncontrol if there was evidence that their state of mind had\nchanged. (Id. at p. 336.) The Court of Appeal deferred to the\ntrial court\u2019s conclusion, after taking evidence, that the\nmanagement \u201cshould not again be permitted to control the\ndestinies of the policyholders.\u201d (Ibid.) So, too, here, the court and\nthe commissioner would only have been obligated to terminate\nthe conservatorship if there were evidence that CIC\u2019s\nmanagement had changed its state of mind. We defer to the trial\ncourt\u2019s view that the stipulation to an injunction was insufficient,\ngiven the other evidence of CIC\u2019s intentionally evasive behavior.\n C. Rehabilitation plan to end the conservatorship\n CIC\u2019s remaining arguments challenge the terms of the\ncommissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan pursuant to which CIC can\n\fexit conservatorship, complete its merger with CIC II, and\nredomesticate in New Mexico.\n A conservatorship under section 1011 \u201ccontemplates, not\nthe liquidation of the company involved, but a conservation of the\nassets and business of the company over the period of stress by\nthe commissioner who thereafter yields the control and direction\nto the regular officers of the company.\u201d (Caminetti v. Superior\nCourt (1941) 16 Cal.2d 838, 843.) Section 1012 sets out the terms\nfor ending a conservatorship under section 1011. It states that\nwith one exception not relevant here, a conservatorship order\n\u201cshall continue in force and effect until, on the application either\nof the commissioner or of [the insurer under conservatorship], it\nshall, after a full hearing, appear to the court that the ground for\nthe order directing the commissioner to take title and possession\ndoes not exist or has been removed and that the person can\nproperly resume title and possession of its property and the\nconduct of its business.\u201d (\u00a7 1012.) \u201cIn order to effect\nrehabilitation, the Commissioner may enter into a court-\napproved rehabilitation agreement.\u201d (State of California v. Altus\nFinance, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1295; accord, \u00a7 1043 [\u201cthe\ncommissioner, as conservator or as liquidator, may, subject to the\napproval of said court, . . . mutualize or reinsure the business of\nsuch person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements\u201d]; Carpenter,\nsupra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 323 [\u201cwhen the commissioner files a\npetition to be appointed conservator and asks authority to work\nout a rehabilitation plan,\u201d the proceeding lasts \u201cuntil the\nproposed plan is ultimately passed upon\u201d].)\n\f Section 1043 does not delineate the scope of the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to enter into rehabilitation agreements,\nbut that authority is presumed to be limited by the provisions in\nthe other statutes governing the conservatorship proceedings in\nsections 1010\u20131062. (Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court,\nsupra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 410.) One such statute is section\n1037, which lists various powers the commissioner has as the\nconservator of an insurer. Section 1037, subdivision (c) (section\n1037(c)) states that the commissioner \u201c[s]hall have authority to\ncompound, compromise or in any other manner negotiate\nsettlements of claims against that person upon such terms and\nconditions as the commissioner shall deem to be most\nadvantageous to the estate of the person being administered or\nliquidated or otherwise dealt with under this article.\u201d\n Because CIC sought to merge with an out-of-state entity\nand redomesticate in New Mexico, sections 1071.5 and 1072 are\nalso relevant here. Section 1071.5 states, \u201cEvery insurer which\nwithdraws as an insurer, or is required to withdraw as an\ninsurer, from this State shall, prior to such withdrawal, discharge\nits liabilities to residents of this State. In the case of its policies\ninsuring residents of this State it shall cause the primary\nliabilities under such policies to be reinsured and assumed by\nanother admitted insurer. In the case of such policies as are\nsubject to cancellation by the insurer, it may cancel such policies\npursuant to the terms thereof in lieu of such reinsurance and\nassumption.\u201d Section 1072 provides that if the commissioner\nexamines the books and records of a withdrawing insurer and\n\fdetermines that \u201cthe insurer has no outstanding liabilities to\nresidents of this State and no policies in favor of the residents of\nthis State uncanceled or the primary liabilities under which have\nnot been reinsured and assumed by another admitted insurer, as\nrequired by Section 1071.5, he shall cancel the insurer\u2019s\ncertificates of authority, if unexpired, and he shall permit the\ninsurer to withdraw. The commissioner may, in his discretion,\nwaive any or all of the above requirements if, after such\nexamination, he finds it to be in a solvent condition.\u201d\n 1. Section 2.6\u2019s settlement of the RPA litigation\n a. Relationship to basis for conservatorship\n CIC offers multiple reasons why the provision of the\nrehabilitation plan allowing CIC\u2019s policyholders to settle their\nclaims against CIC is legally unauthorized, but none has merit.\nMost generally, CIC contends the RPA litigation was not the\nbasis for the conservatorship and settlement of the RPA litigation\nis therefore not necessary to address the reasons for the\nconservatorship. The commissioner disputes whether section\n1012 requires each aspect of a rehabilitation plan to be limited to\nthe original grounds for the conservatorship, pointing out that\nsection 1012 states that a conservatorship ends when the court\nconcludes that the circumstances that gave rise to it no longer\nexist \u201cand that the person can properly resume title and\npossession of its property and the conduct of its business.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1012, italics added.) But he also maintains that settlement of\n\fthe RPA litigation is related to the grounds for the\nconservatorship.\n The language of section 1012 is broad, and the second\nclause is written in the present tense, suggesting that the\ncommissioner can include in a rehabilitation plan provisions\naimed at remediating flaws or issues he discovers in the\nconserved insurer during the course of the conservatorship that\nare not related to the reason for the conservatorship. But we\nneed not come to a definitive conclusion on this question.\nAssuming for the sake of argument that CIC is correct and a\nrehabilitation plan can only address the reasons for a\nconservatorship, the trial court and the commissioner reasonably\nconcluded that settlement of the RPA litigation does so. 5\n CIC attempted to merge without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval and depart the state because the commissioner refused\nto approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition of CIC. The Ninth Circuit\nrecently concluded as much, noting that Menzies merged CIC\nwith CIC II \u201cto bypass the California insurance regulatory regime\naltogether\u201d (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th\nat pp. 584\u2013585) \u201cand that the merger was an obvious attempt to\navoid the California insurance regulatory regime\u201d (id. at p. 597).\nThe commissioner refused to approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition\n\n5 CIC argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the second\n\ncondition in section 1012 for termination of a conservatorship,\nthat the insurer can properly resume title and possession of its\nbusiness, violates state administrative law and due process.\nBecause we do not rely on this aspect of section 1012 to affirm the\ntrial court\u2019s order, we need not examine these arguments.\n\fbecause of concerns about the RPA litigation. If the\ncommissioner had not placed CIC in conservatorship, CIC could\nhave merged, thereby thwarting the commissioner\u2019s ability to\nsatisfy himself regarding CIC\u2019s liability under the RPA litigation.\nEnding the conservatorship without also addressing the\ncommissioner\u2019s concerns about the RPA litigation therefore would\nhave failed to remedy the motivation behind it. CIC asserts that\nthe merger was intended only to avoid collapse of the Berkshire\nHathaway deal due to the commissioner\u2019s refusal to approve or\ndisapprove the transaction, but its account ignores the substance\nof why that deal almost collapsed.\n b. Mandated departure\n CIC objects that its departure from California cannot\njustify section 2.6 because its departure is not voluntary but\nrather mandated by section 2.4 of the plan. 6 CIC did not object to\nsection 2.4 in the trial court and does not object to it on appeal, so\nthis argument is not well taken. CIC\u2019s claims about a mandated\ndeparture also belie the history of this case. CIC began the\nprocess of merging with CIC II and redomesticating to allow the\nBerkshire Hathaway transaction to close. The Berkshire\nHathaway transaction did close, which was one of the New\n\n6 Section 2.4 of the rehabilitation plan states that on the\n\ndate the reinsurance and assumption agreement takes effect, the\ncommissioner as conservator \u201cshall effectuate the merger of CIC\ninto and with\u201d CIC II, \u201cthereby completing the attempted\nredomestication of CIC from California to New Mexico, and upon\nthe effective date of the merger of CIC into and with CIC II and\nthe transfer of the domicile of CIC to New Mexico, CIC shall\ncease to be a California domestic insurer.\u201d\n\fMexico superintendent\u2019s conditions of approval of the merger.\nCIC II also satisfied the other condition, which was that CIC II\nfile articles of merger with the New Mexico secretary of state. All\nthat remains is the filing of the certificate of merger with the\nCalifornia secretary of state. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) It is\nthus more accurate to say that sections 2.4 and 2.6 of the\nrehabilitation plan place conditions on the completion of the\ndeparture that is already under way.\n Given that CIC began the departure process without the\ncommissioner\u2019s approval and it is partly complete, the\ncommissioner is within his rights to place conditions on the\ncompletion of the departure. When an insurer follows the normal\nprocedure for withdrawal from the state by filing an application\nand surrendering its certificate to the commissioner (\u00a7 1070), the\n\u201cinsurer who has commenced the withdrawal process may not\nunilaterally terminate it and the Commissioner may condition\ntermination of the withdrawal process on appropriate remedial\naction by the insurer.\u201d (Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Gillespie\n(1990) 50 Cal.3d 82, 102 (Gillespie).) The commissioner must\nhave the same or greater authority over an insurer who is placed\nin conservatorship for attempting to extinguish its certificate\nthrough a merger and departure without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. (See \u00a7 701 [an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority \u201cshall\nexpire with the expiration or termination of a corporate existence\nof the holder thereof\u201d].)\n\f c. Statutory basis\n According to CIC, section 1071.5, which the trial court cited\nas authority supporting section 2.6, is inapplicable for several\nreasons, including that the RPA litigation claims are not\n\u201cliabilities\u201d of CIC within the meaning of section 1071.5 and\nrequiring it to settle litigation as a condition of withdrawing from\nthe state would violate its constitutional rights.\n CIC\u2019s interpretation of section 1071.5 is dubious, but we\nneed not examine CIC\u2019s contentions in detail because the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to fashion the rehabilitation plan does\nnot depend on section 1071.5. Section 1071.5 governs an\ninsurer\u2019s withdrawal from the state, so if CIC were simply trying\nto withdraw then section 1071.5 would govern. But CIC is not\nlike most withdrawing insurers. It is under conservatorship.\nSection 1037(c), which the trial court cited as supporting section\n2.6, allows the commissioner as conservator of an insurer to\n\u201ccompromise or in any other manner negotiate settlements of\nclaims against\u201d the conserved insurer. Sections 1012 and 1043\nalso empower the commissioner to enter into rehabilitation\nagreements to end a conservatorship. The commissioner\nreasonably concluded that settlement of the RPA litigation was\nnecessary to end the condition that gave rise to the\nconservatorship, as we concluded ante, so sections 1012, 1043,\nand 1037(c) provide sufficient authorization to support section\n2.6.\n CIC resists application of section 1037(c), arguing that\nstatute gives the commissioner authority to settle cases during\n\fthe conservatorship, not as a condition of exiting it. This gets\nthings backwards. As CIC itself notes, Commercial Nat. Bank v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at page 410 recognized\nthat the commissioner can reasonably exercise the state\u2019s police\npower and has authority under section 1043 to enter into\nrehabilitation agreements, subject to limitations in the other\nstatutes dealing with conservatorships. If section 1037(c)\nauthorizes settlements, that is no reason to think section 1043\ndoes not. CIC fails to show that the commissioner\u2019s section 1043\nauthority to use settlements to fashion a rehabilitation plan is\nnarrower than his section 1037(c) settlement authority during a\nconservatorship.\n d. Claims against affiliates\n CIC notes that section 1037(c) allows the commissioner as\nconservator to settle \u201cclaims against that person\u201d being\nconserved. It then argues that the RPA litigation mostly consists\nof claims against CIC\u2019s affiliates, not CIC itself. However, the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority in a conservatorship is not limited to\nthe entity being conserved. (Garamendi v. Executive Life Ins. Co.\n(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 504, 520, 523 (Garamendi).) A trial court\nmay assert in rem jurisdiction over assets of entities that have an\n\u201cidentity of interest\u201d with a conserved insurer and include them\nwithin the scope of the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan for an\ninsurer if it is reasonably necessary to promote the insurer\u2019s\nrehabilitation. (Ibid.) Garamendi relied in part on the fact that\ninsurance conservatorships are a state law equivalent of\nbankruptcy and that federal bankruptcy law asserts jurisdiction\n\fover entities that are legally separate from the debtor where\nnecessary to the successful administration of a debtor\u2019s estate.\n(Id. at pp. 515\u2013517.) But Garamendi also emphasized that \u201cthe\nbusiness of insurance is affected with a public interest,\u201d\n\u201cinsurance is a public asset,\u201d and creditors, policyholders, and the\npublic have an important stake in preserving the business of\ninsurers. (Id. at pp. 515\u2013516.)\n As the trial court ruled, Garamendi\u2019s holding supports\nsection 2.6 of the plan here. While there is no indication that CIC\nis insolvent, the commissioner\u2019s authority springs from the same\nstatutes that allow conservatorships in cases of insolvency and\nthe public has an interest in regulation and legally sound\noperation of insurers like CIC. CIC is correct that neither the\ncommissioner nor the trial court found that CIC\u2019s affiliates were\nalter egos of CIC, and the relationship between CIC and its\naffiliates is not exactly the same as the entities at issue in\nGaramendi. But nothing in Garamendi conditioned its assertion\nof in rem jurisdiction on an alter ego finding, and its rationale\nbased on the public interest in insurers also applies here.\n(Garamendi, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 516\u2013520, 523.)\n CIC and its affiliates operated the RPA and EquityComp\nprograms as a joint enterprise, dividing obligations and authority\nfor the express purpose of avoiding regulation by the\ncommissioner, as the commissioner found in Shasta Linen and as\nother courts have concluded. (E.g., Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1116\u20131117 [agreeing with Shasta Linen\nthat CIC and its affiliates \u201cwere \u2018so enmeshed\u2019 and \u2018intertwined\u2019\n\fthat they should be considered together in determining whether\nthe RPA constitutes a modification of the CIC policies\u201d]; Luxor\nCabs, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 986 [viewing \u201cEquityComp as a\nsingle, integrated insurance program\u201d despite the distinctions\nbetween CIC and its affiliates]; Applied Underwriters, Inc. v.\nLara, supra, 37 F.4th at pp. 592\u2013593 [discussing Garamendi with\napproval].) As one of these courts noted, \u201cObviously, allowing an\ninsurer to circumvent the comprehensive regulatory structure\napplicable to the issuance of workers\u2019 compensation insurance in\nthis state simply by amending its approved policy forms through\na side agreement with a subsidiary is contrary to the public\npolicy underlying California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law and\ncannot be countenanced.\u201d (Luxor Cabs, at p. 986.) The RPA\nlitigation has reflected this integrated relationship between CIC\nand its affiliates, since in at least one case, a federal court\naffirmed an arbitration award requiring a policyholder to pay\npremiums to CIC, over the policyholder\u2019s objection that CIC was\nnot a party to the arbitration. (American, Etc., Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (N.D. Cal. Dec. 28,\n2017, No. 17-cv-03660 DMR) 2017 WL 6622993, at *3\u2013*5.) In\nthese circumstances, excluding the RPA litigation from the\nrehabilitation plan because plaintiffs sued one of the other\nentities involved in the joint EquityComp program besides CIC\nwould thwart the commissioner\u2019s authority to remedy the\nproblem that gave rise to the conservatorship.\n\f e. Most advantageous terms\n CIC contends that section 1037(c) only allows settlement of\nclaims \u201cupon such terms and conditions as the commissioner\nshall deem to be most advantageous to the estate of the person\nbeing administered\u201d (\u00a7 1037(c)) and asserts the trial court did not\nfind that section 2.6\u2019s three settlement options are to CIC\u2019s\nadvantage.\n CIC\u2019s statement of the standard governing settlements by\nan insurance conservator is incomplete. While section 1037(c)\nrequires settlements to be most advantageous to the estate,\nsection 1057 declares that when acting as a conservator, \u201cthe\ncommissioner shall be deemed to be a trustee for the benefit of all\ncreditors and other persons interested in the estate of the person\nagainst whom the proceedings are pending.\u201d And as In re\nExecutive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at page 376\nexplained, the commissioner\u2019s actions are also inflected with the\npublic interest, given the character of insurance and that the\ncommissioner \u201cacts not only as a trustee but also as a servant of\nthe state in the exercise of its police power.\u201d \u201cOf necessity, if\nrequired to satisfy the public interest, the Commissioner\npossesses considerable discretion in settling claims.\u201d (Id. at\np. 381.) Thus, when deciding whether a settlement of claims\nagainst a conserved insurer is \u201cboth in the best interest of the\nconservancy estate and necessary to vindicate the public interest\u201d\n(ibid.), the commissioner must consider not just the insurer itself,\nbut also others interested in the insurer, such as policyholders or\ncreditors, as well as the public interest at stake. Additionally,\n\feven when a settlement of one claim cannot be justified on its\nown, it may be justified if it is part of a global settlement or\ncontributes to a near global settlement. (Id. at p. 382.)\n The trial court quoted In re Executive Life Ins. Co.\u2019s\nstatement of the standard for settlements, described how section\n2.6 offered the possibility of a settlement of the substantial\nmajority of the RPA litigation, described in detail the substantial\nevidence supporting the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that CIC faced\nsignificant legal exposure in the litigation, and found section 2.6\nhad a rational basis in its entirety. The import of the trial court\u2019s\ndecision is that the commissioner reasonably concluded the\nsection 2.6 settlement options were most advantageous to the\npublic interest and the estate because of CIC\u2019s potential liability.\n Regarding CIC\u2019s potential liability, the trial court found\nsubstantial evidence supported the commissioner\u2019s belief that the\nRPA was void. Section 2.6\u2019s first settlement option reflects this\npossibility, since it would allow policyholders to settle by paying\nonly what they owe under the guaranteed cost policy. The trial\ncourt recognized that policyholders could also enforce the RPA,\ndespite its illegality, to prevent unjust enrichment to CIC.\nSection 2.6\u2019s third settlement option represents this possibility,\nsince it would allow policyholders to enforce the guaranteed cost\npolicies and the RPA in full, which might result in a payment to\nCIC.\n The trial court found that CIC could also be liable under\nthe Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.\n(UCL)) for engaging in unlawful acts based on the failure to file\n\fthe RPA for approval, unfair acts by using an unfiled insurance\npolicy that was not disclosed until after the policyholders were\nalready bound, and fraudulent practices by misrepresenting the\nEquityComp plan in marketing materials. The trial court found\nsection 2.6\u2019s second settlement option \u2014 which would allow\npolicyholders to obtain restitution of any amounts they paid over\nthe cost of a standard, approved retrospective rating plan \u2014 to be\na reasonable approach to calculating quantum meruit restitution,\nwhich would be a remedy for UCL violations.\n CIC does not mention, let alone dispute, any of the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions regarding its potential liability under these\ntheories. Instead, it contends that a global settlement is not to\nCIC\u2019s advantage and violates its due process rights because CIC\ndefeated all attempts to certify classes of policyholders, the\nsettlement would prevent CIC from challenging each plaintiff\u2019s\nevidence, and it would require CIC to forfeit potentially\nmeritorious individual defenses, including showing that a\nplaintiff had suffered no damages. CIC also points out that its\nShasta Linen settlement with the department acknowledged that\nthe legality of the RPA was \u201cfor the courts to decide\u201d and asserts\nthat it prevailed in RPA litigation on numerous grounds.\n We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s and\ncommissioner\u2019s conclusions that CIC faces significant enough\nliability under the RPA litigation that it is most advantageous to\nCIC, policyholders, creditors, and the public for the commissioner\nto offer to settle on the terms in section 2.6. (See In re Executive\nLife Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 358 [courts must affirm\n\frehabilitation plan if it is not arbitrary, discriminatory, contrary\nto a specific statute, or a breach of the conservator\u2019s fiduciary\nduty as trustee].)\n The Shasta Linen settlement\u2019s statement about the courts\ndeciding the legality of the RPA is of no consequence, since it\npredated CIC\u2019s attempted unauthorized merger to evade the\ncommissioner\u2019s consideration of the RPA litigation and the\nresulting conservatorship. The settlement also reserved the\ncommissioner\u2019s right to \u201cinitiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d Nothing in the settlement precludes section\n2.6.\n The trial court considered CIC\u2019s claim of substantial\nsuccess in the RPA litigation and reasonably found it\nunpersuasive. CIC did prevail in defeating class certification\nmotions, but those rulings have no bearing on the merits of any\nindividual policyholder\u2019s claims. The fact that the RPA litigants\nwere unable to satisfy the procedural requirements for class\naction due to individualized issues, as CIC asserts, is irrelevant\nto deciding whether the global settlement and the application of\nthe three settlement options is in CIC\u2019s interest. Section 2.6 does\nnot vitiate CIC\u2019s class certification victories in any event. The\npolicyholders eligible to settle under section 2.6 are those who\nalready filed claims, those whom CIC identifies as potentially\nowing CIC payments, and ten policyholders who had already\n\fsubmitted claims to the conservator. CIC does not contend that\nthese categories encompass the same number of policyholders\nthat a class action would have.\n Apart from class certification motions, the victories CIC\ncites primarily concern enforcement of arbitrability delegation or\nforum selection clauses in courts in other states or piecemeal\ndismissals of individual causes of action. These limited successes\ndo not show that CIC has a strong likelihood of ultimately\ndefeating policyholders\u2019 suits as a whole. The record as a whole\ncontains substantial evidence that policyholders prevailed more\noften in showing the RPA, or portions of it, to be void and\nunenforceable, especially after the issuance of the Court of\nAppeal decisions beginning with Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th 1096. CIC points out that the Court of Appeal\ndecisions the trial court cited concern the enforceability of the\narbitration agreement within the RPA, rather than the RPA\nitself. (E.g., id. at p. 1121, fn. 6 [decision was limited to factual\nrecord on the hearing on motion to compel and did not preclude\nparties from litigating merits of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action\nregarding the RPA].) This argument ignores that the same\ngrounds for invalidating an arbitration agreement within a\ncontract can provide a stronger basis for invalidating the entire\ncontract. (Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S.\n63, 71 [\u201cIn some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the\ncontract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the\nsame basis as applied only to the severable agreement to\n\farbitrate\u201d].) Moreover, other decisions the commissioner cited\ndeclared the entire RPA invalid.\n CIC notes that some decisions have found a policyholder\nliable for unpaid premiums regardless of the RPA\u2019s illegality.\n(E.g., Applied Underwriting, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb.\nAug. 2, 2018, No. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4.)\nAgain, there are decisions going the other direction.\nAdditionally, litigation of many of the cases was stayed because\nof the initiation of the conservatorship. Given that the\nEquityComp system was structured as a combination of the\nguaranteed cost policies and the RPA and that the commissioner\nsupplied an actuary\u2019s opinion that CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npremiums were roughly 33 percent higher than market rates, the\ntrial court could reasonably conclude that courts or arbitrators in\nthe future (including appellate courts, in cases where CIC had\nprevailed or would likely prevail in a lower court) would find it\nunfair and inequitable to enforce just the guaranteed cost plan\nrates after finding the RPA to be illegal. 7\n\n7 CIC disputes the 33 percent figure, claiming the actuary\n\nonly said in his deposition that the 33 percent figure was his\n\u201cimpression\u201d and relied on no data. CIC also notes that it\nprovided an actuarial expert\u2019s analysis that found CIC\u2019s rates\nwere in the middle of the market. But the department\u2019s actuary\nexplained elsewhere that CIC\u2019s rates were based on the loss\ntrends of its policy portfolio and those loss trends were higher\nthan the loss trends for the industry as a whole. The department\nalso noted in its reply that CIC\u2019s actuarial analysis was based on\nfiled rates, not the rates CIC actually charged, and did not reflect\nthat CIC\u2019s rates were higher than the industry-wide average\ndespite CIC not insuring policyholders with the highest losses.\n\f In short, the evidence from CIC and the commissioner\ndemonstrates at best that CIC has had limited success in the\nRPA litigation. This is not sufficient to show an abuse of\ndiscretion by the trial court or commissioner in finding section\n2.6\u2019s settlement options to be most advantageous to CIC\u2019s estate\nand interested third parties. Considering California\u2019s strong\npublic policy favoring the settlement of disputes (Rheinhart v.\nNissan North America, Inc. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1027)\nand the costs of litigation, the trial court could reasonably\ndetermine that settlement was beneficial to CIC here, especially\nbecause it would expedite the end of the conservatorship.\nAdditionally, settlement of a claim that may not be justified on\nits own can be justified as part of a global or near-global\nsettlement. (In re Executive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 382.) Even if CIC might have defeated some of the RPA\ncases on the merits based on individualized defenses or had a net\nrecovery after some plaintiffs\u2019 damages were offset against\npremiums still owing to CIC or its affiliates, the trial court and\ncommissioner reasonably decided that it was most advantageous\nto achieve a near-global settlement, with the resulting litigation\ncost savings, by offering the three settlement options in section\n2.6.\n\nThe department\u2019s analysis constitutes substantial evidence, so\nthe trial court was entitled to decide which of these competing\nanalyses it found most persuasive.\n\f f. More favorable settlement\n CIC challenges option 2 specifically as offering RPA\nplaintiffs a more favorable outcome than they could have\nobtained through litigation because it calculates the fair market\nvalue of the benefits under the EquityComp plan by using a\ngeneral retrospective rating plan rather than one that CIC\noffered. Option 2 represents the commissioner\u2019s attempt to use a\ngeneric retrospective policy approved by the commissioner to\ncalculate the fair market value of the coverage a policyholder\nreceived from CIC, which CIC would be entitled to retain under\nthe UCL even if a plaintiff prevailed. As the trial court noted,\nfair market value is commonly defined as that amount \u201cthat\n\u2018hypothetical buyers and sellers\u2019 would pay in a \u2018hypothetical\ntransaction.\u2019 \u201d (Long Beach Memorial Medical Center v. Kaiser\nFoundation Health Plan, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 323, 343, 345\n[discussing measure of damages under quantum meruit claim,\nwhich was identical to restitution under UCL]; see also id. at\np. 346 [defining fair market value based on hypothetical\ntransactions \u201cis affirmatively helpful because it emphasizes\nanother pertinent legal principle \u2014 namely, that the parties\u2019\nprior actual transactions are not dipositive\u201d].) Option 2 therefore\nrepresents a reasonable approximation of a remedy that RPA\nplaintiffs might obtain through litigation, but it avoids the costs\nof litigation CIC would otherwise incur.\n 2. Reinsurance of CIC\u2019s policies under section 2.2\n Besides section 2.6\u2019s settlement options for the RPA\nlitigation, CIC also challenges the trial court\u2019s approval of section\n\f2.2 of the plan, which requires CIC to enter into a reinsurance\nand assumption agreement for its California policies. \u201cA\nreinsurance contract is \u2018one by which an insurer procures a third\nperson to insure him [i.e., the insurer] against loss or liability by\nreason of such original insurance.\u2019 (\u00a7 620.) If the agreement is\npurely for reinsurance, it benefits only the insurer; the original\ninsured has no interest in it (\u00a7 623) and acquires no rights under\nit. [Citation.] Such an agreement clearly cannot operate to\nrelieve the original insurer of any obligation to the insured. [\u00b6] A\ncontract by which a reinsurer assumes the policies of the original\ninsurer does result in the reinsurer being directly liable to the\noriginal insureds [citation], but it does not release the original\ninsurer, which remains jointly obligated with the reinsurer\n[citations.].\u201d (Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at pp. 95\u201396, italics\nomitted.)\n CIC\u2019s first argument is that section 2.2 improperly requires\nthe sale of over 85 percent of its business to end the\nconservatorship, which is tantamount to liquidation. CIC points\nout that liquidation is supposed to be the last resort in a\nconservatorship. (Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 329.) But\nliquidation entails distributing an insurer\u2019s assets to creditors,\nand it is a last resort because it dissolves the company and\ndeprives policyholders of insurance protection. (Ibid.) CIC, by\ncontrast, will retain any proceeds from the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement, rather than distributing them to its\ncreditors, so section 2.2 is not a liquidation. Section 2.2 also does\n\fnot deprive any policyholders of insurance protection, so it need\nnot be a last resort like liquidation.\n Although CIC briefly suggests otherwise, reinsurance is\nwithin the commissioner\u2019s express authority as conservator.\nSection 1043 states that \u201cthe commissioner, as conservator or as\nliquidator, may, subject to the approval of said court, and subject\nto such liens as may be necessary mutualize or reinsure the\nbusiness of such person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements.\u201d\nThere can be no question that the commissioner has the\nnecessary authority.\n CIC claims that the commissioner could have pursued less\nonerous alternatives, including allowing CIC to continue to\nservice its policies after leaving the state. As noted ante, CIC\u2019s\nattempted merger with CIC II would have led to it departing\nfrom California, functionally equivalent to a withdrawal from the\nstate. Before withdrawing from the state, an insurer must\n\u201cdischarge its liabilities to residents of this State,\u201d including\ncausing its policies \u201cto be reinsured and assumed by another\nadmitted insurer.\u201d (\u00a7 1071.5.) The commissioner will then cancel\nthe withdrawing insurer\u2019s certificates of authority and allow the\ninsurer to withdraw. (\u00a7 1072.) Section 1072 gives the\ncommissioner discretion to waive this requirement if he finds the\nwithdrawing insurer to be solvent. (Ibid.)\n The default assumption of sections 1071.5 and 1072 is that\na withdrawing insurer will have its remaining policies reinsured\nand assumed by an admitted insurer. The commissioner\nreasonably decided to the take the same approach with CIC given\n\fthat its merger was functionally a withdrawal from the state.\nCIC protests that Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at page 99 held that\nan insurer that withdraws can still service its policies from out of\nstate, as demonstrated by the fact that section 1072 allows the\ncommissioner to waive the reinsurance and assumption\nrequirement for a solvent insurer. This is true, but the\ncommissioner still retains the discretion over whether to waive\nthe reinsurance and assumption requirement. (\u00a7 1072 [\u201cThe\ncommissioner may, in his discretion, waive any or all of the above\nrequirements . . . \u201d].) The trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin not requiring the commissioner to waive the presumptive\nrequirement of reinsurance and assumption here, where CIC\nattempted to merge and depart from California without the\ncommissioner\u2019s consent and with the purpose of evading the\ncommissioner\u2019s review of its handling of the RPA litigation. 8\n(Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 597\n[CIC merger \u201cwas an obvious attempt to avoid the California\ninsurance regulatory regime\u201d].)\n In its second challenge to section 2.2, CIC argues the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by approving the specific provision\nthat requires that any reinsurer who is affiliated with CIC, such\nas Continental, to use a third-party claims administrator. CIC\n\n8 The trial court also found the reinsurance and assumption\n\nrequirement justified based on evidence that CIC\u2019s management\nhad repeatedly evaded the commissioner\u2019s regulatory authority,\nboth before and during the conservatorship. Much, if not all, of\nthe evidence of this evasion provides further support for the trial\ncourt\u2019s order, but it is not necessary to consider it because CIC\u2019s\nconduct giving rise to the conservatorship is sufficient on its own.\n\fargues that the department proposed the third-party\nadministrator condition for a CIC-affiliated reinsurer without\nevidence to support it and then tried and failed to justify it\nretroactively.\n The trial court found the commissioner reasonably insisted\non a third-party claims administrator if Continental or another\nCIC affiliate reinsured and assumed CIC\u2019s policies, based in part\non the fact that Continental is operated by the same management\nas CIC, including Menzies as the president and chief executive\nofficer. The trial court also found substantial evidence showed\nthat CIC had not treated policyholders fairly by (1) increasing\npayouts on claims or inflating the reserves necessary for claims,\nthereby triggering higher costs for policyholders; and (2) keeping\nclaims open to postpone having to return unused premiums to the\npolicyholders, so that CIC could maximize the investment returns\nit made on the funds.\n We find substantial evidentiary support for all three points.\nFirst, the record shows that Menzies is Continental\u2019s president\nand chief executive officer and Jeffrey Silver is its Secretary.\nMenzies and Silver hold similar roles in CIC as well as AUCRA,\nwhich is another of the entities involved in the RPA and the\nEquityComp program. Given the identical management,\nallowing Continental to reinsure and assume CIC\u2019s policies and\ncontinue servicing claims would defeat the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement\u2019s purpose of protecting policyholders from\nmanagement that has demonstrated its willingness to attempt to\nevade the commissioner\u2019s oversight. It would essentially change\n\fthe nameplate on the door but allow the business to continue to\noperate as usual. This alone is sufficient to support the third-\nparty administrator requirement.\n Second, the commissioner submitted evidence showing that\nthe EquityComp program incentivized CIC to increase payments\nor reserves for claims unnecessarily and that CIC in fact did so.\nRegarding the incentive, most retrospective rating plans increase\nthe premiums a policyholder pays linearly as losses increase, up\nto a maximum premium. But the EquityComp plan increased\npremiums steeply for the initial portion of losses to a certain\namount, then raised premiums more slowly if losses continued to\nincrease. If CIC overpaid claims and thereby increased its losses,\nor if it set an artificially high estimate of reserves necessary to\npay losses on a claim in the future, it could trigger the initial\nsteep increase in premiums that policyholders would have to pay.\nCounsel for plaintiffs in many of the RPA cases, Larry J.\nLichtenegger, submitted a declaration detailing specific instances\nin which CIC\u2019s overpayment of employee claims increased\npolicyholders\u2019 costs, including one in which a putatively injured\nformer employee was working for a competitor, and CIC verified\nthe fraud but continued paying the former employee. The\ncommissioner also cited the Shasta Linen case, which relayed a\npolicyholder\u2019s account of CIC\u2019s failure to investigate potential\nfraud on a claim that cost the policyholder over $100,000.\n(Shasta Linen, supra, at p. 38.)\n Finally, the commissioner provided evidence that CIC kept\nclaims open to retain policyholders\u2019 funds longer, to maximize\n\fCIC\u2019s profits. The EquityComp program was structured to allow\nAUCRA (the CIC-affiliated reinsurer that took risk and\npremiums from CIC and passed them back to the policyholders)\nto require policyholders to post collateral to secure their payment\nof additional premiums due to losses. Setting high collateral\namounts for future losses benefited CIC and its affiliates because\nCIC could earn investment returns on the collateral and did not\nhave to share the returns with the policyholders. CIC followed\nthese incentives in several cases documented in Lichtenegger\u2019s\ndeclaration. For example, CIC refused to accept an employee\u2019s\noffer to settle a claim for less than the amount of reserves set\naside for the claim, even though the policyholder, which would\nincur the cost for the settlement, wanted to pay it in order to\nhave CIC refund the excess reserves.\n In response to this evidence, CIC cites evidence that the\ndepartment allowed CIC to continue to handle claims during the\nconservatorship and CIC was rated highly in claims handling in\nstate audits. CIC also attacks Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility,\nasserting, among other things, that he and his clients were\nobviously self-interested and arguing that he cited very few\nspecific examples of claims handling. Finally, CIC argues,\nprimarily in a footnote, that it submitted a declaration by an\nexpert who reviewed CIC\u2019s files for the policyholders mentioned\nand refuted Lichtenegger\u2019s allegations.\n The trial court reasonably rejected or discounted CIC\u2019s\narguments. The commissioner could reasonably conclude that his\noversight and that of his representatives, including being\n\fphysically present at CIC\u2019s offices in Nebraska, were sufficient to\ndeter CIC from its prior abusive practices. CIC\u2019s high marks in\naudits of its claims handling do not undercut the commissioner\u2019s\nevidence of overpayments. As the trial court noted, the audits\nlooked for evidence of underpayments, not overpayments, so\nCIC\u2019s high scores do not refute the evidence that CIC was\noverpaying claims to collect higher premiums from its\npolicyholders. And Lichtenegger\u2019s declaration did not purport to\nprovide an exhaustive description of all of his clients\u2019 qualms\nabout CIC\u2019s claims handling, so the quantity of examples he cited\nis not disqualifying. Although Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility was\nlegitimately open to question for various reasons (including his\nposition as advocate for policyholders with RPA litigation claims\nagainst CIC), credibility decisions were for the trial court and the\ncommissioner to make. The court and commissioner could\nreasonably decide to rely on Lichtenegger, given his unique\nfamiliarity with the experiences of many different policyholders.\nAlthough CIC\u2019s expert declaration provided the trial court an\nalternative view of the evidence, the trial court was ultimately\nfaced with conflicting evidence on both sides, and CIC\u2019s evidence\nrelating to its claims handling was not so overwhelming as to\nundercut the value of the commissioner\u2019s evidence as a matter of\nlaw.\n In sum, we are unpersuaded that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by approving section 2.2.\n DISPOSITION\n The trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\n\f BROWN, P.

ECF Nos. 50; 52. Defendant, the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d),\n\nopposes the Motion. ECF No. 51. Because Eddington fails to show he is eligible for attorneys\u2019\n\nfees, the Court recommends that Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nEddington is a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, which he refers to as \u201ca leading think\n\ntank dedicated to promoting individual liberty.\u201d Decl. of Patrick G. Eddington, ECF No. 50-1 \u00b6\u00b6\n\n3\u20134. Eddington\u2019s research and publications focus on domestic surveillance and political\n\nrepression. Id. \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Eddington filed a FOIA request with the National Security Division\n\n(\u201cNSD\u201d) of the DOJ. Id. \u00b6 6. Eddington sought records from June 3, 2015, to May 15, 2019,\n\nconcerning the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective\n\nDiscipline Over Monitoring Act of 2015 (\u201cUSA FREEDOM\u201d). Id. at 4\u20135.1 According to\n Citations throughout this Report and Recommendation are to the page numbers in a filing\u2019s\nECF header.\n\fEddington, the Act placed conditions on the Government\u2019s collection of citizens\u2019\n\ntelecommunications metadata. Id. \u00b6 7. Eddington\u2019s FOIA request had two parts: \u201c1) internal or\n\nexternal reports on the efficacy of programs carried out under [USA FREEDOM], including\n\nsolicited or unsolicited feedback from agents or intelligence analysts, whether formal or informal\n\nin nature; and 2) any correspondence dealing with the termination or initiation of programs\n\nconducted under [USA FREEDOM].\u201d Id. at 4.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, the DOJ acknowledged receipt of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request. Id. at \u00b6\n\n10, 6. The DOJ informed Eddington that it processed requests \u201con a first-in, first-out basis.\u201d Id.\n\nat 6. The DOJ also noted that the processing time for Eddington\u2019s request would depend on the\n\ncomplexity of the request, whether the request involved sensitive information or many records,\n\nand whether the DOJ needed to consult with other agencies to process the request. Id.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nEddington filed suit less than a month later, on July 12, 2019. ECF No. 1. In the\n\nComplaint, he requested that the DOJ conduct a reasonable search and produce all non-exempt\n\nrequested records. Id. at 2\u20133. The DOJ answered the Complaint on August 27, 2019. ECF No.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, the Parties filed their first joint status report (\u201cJSR\u201d), in which the\n\nDOJ stated it was \u201cin the process of conducting its searches\u201d for responsive records. ECF No. 11\n\n\u00b6 2. The DOJ noted it had to seek those records from individual custodians, as there was no\n\ncentralized database. Id. The DOJ anticipated completing its search by October 31, 2019. Id. On\n\nthat date, the DOJ informed the Court that it had completed its search for part one of Eddington\u2019s\n\nFOIA request and found no responsive records. ECF No. 12 \u00b6 2. The Parties also discussed\n\nnarrowing part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request to exclude internal communications. ECF Nos.\n\f12 \u00b6 2; 13 \u00b6 2. The DOJ claimed that including those communications in its search would cause a\n\ndelay in any document production. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 2; 14 \u00b6 2. The Parties, however, did not reach\n\nan agreement on narrowing part two of the request. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 3; 14 \u00b6 3.\n\nIn January 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it estimated completing its search for\n\npart two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request by March 3, 2020. ECF No. 14 \u00b6 4. On that date, the DOJ\n\ntold Eddington that it had completed its search and was reviewing results. ECF Nos. 51\u20131; 17 \u00b6\n\n4. The DOJ stated it would provide Eddington with another response by May 3, 2020. ECF No.\n\n51\u20131. On March 17, 2020, however, the agency informed the Court that the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nwould impact its ability to timely process records and issue a response. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 13, 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it could not provide another response\n\nor production schedule because the DOJ\u2019s telework policies prevented access to a classified server\n\non which the responsive records were kept. ECF No. 19 \u00b6 4. These access restrictions continued\n\nuntil April 2022. See ECF Nos. 20 \u00b6 4; 38 \u00b6 3.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, the DOJ stated it had recently resumed processing Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest and had located approximately 600 potentially-responsive pages. ECF No. 38 \u00b6 4. The\n\nDOJ\u2019s processing involved coordination with other government agencies, including the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). ECF Nos. 38 \u00b6 5; 50-1 \u00b6 11; 51-3. On December 16, 2022, the\n\nFBI produced a redacted and previously-sealed declaration that the Government had filed in the\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ECF Nos. 50-1 at 7\u201324; 51-3.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, the DOJ issued its final response to part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest. ECF Nos. 41 \u00b6 5; 51-2. The DOJ informed Eddington that it had located seventy-two\n\npages of responsive records, all of which the DOJ withheld pursuant to various FOIA exemptions.\n\nECF No. 51-2. Eddington did not challenge any of the agency\u2019s withholdings or redactions. ECF\n\fNo. 50-1 \u00b6 14. On March 29, 2024, Eddington filed this Motion for an award of $18,980.15 in\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees and costs. ECF Nos. 50; 52.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to FOIA\u2019s fee recovery provision, a court may assess reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n\nand litigation costs against the United States in a case \u201cin which the complainant has substantially\n\nprevailed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). The objectives of this provision are twofold: 1) to\n\nencourage FOIA litigation that benefits the public interest when private interest is lacking; and 2)\n\nto compensate plaintiffs for enduring an agency\u2019s unreasonable stonewalling in complying with\n\nFOIA\u2019s requirements. See Kwoka v. Internal Revenue Serv., 989 F.3d 1058, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\n\nEven if the Court deems the plaintiff a prevailing party under the FOIA statute, a fee award is not\n\nautomatic. See Morley v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 894 F.3d 389, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam)\n\n(noting that FOIA states that the Court \u201cmay\u201d award fees to a prevailing plaintiff, not that the\n\nCourt \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d). The Court retains broad discretion in deciding whether to award fees.\n\nSee Hall & Assocs. v. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 210 F. Supp. 3d 13, 19 (D.D.C. 2016) (citations\n\nomitted), aff\u2019d per curiam, No. 16-5315, 2018 WL 1896493 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 9, 2018)\n\n(unpublished).\n\nTo recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under FOIA, a plaintiff must be both eligible for and\n\nentitled to fees. Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 811 F.3d 22, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2016). If a\n\nplaintiff is eligible and entitled, they may recover a fee award that is reasonable. Urb. Air\n\nInitiative, Inc. v. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 442 F. Supp. 3d 301, 310 (D.D.C. 2020) (citations omitted).\n\f I. Eddington Is Not Eligible to Recover Attorneys\u2019 Fees Because He Has Failed to\n Establish That He Substantially Prevailed in This Lawsuit.\n\nA. Legal Standard\n\nOne of the ways a plaintiff can show they substantially prevailed in the litigation is by\n\nestablishing that they obtained relief through \u201ca voluntary or unilateral change in position by the\n\nagency, if the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim [was] not insubstantial.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(ii). This is\n\nreferred to as the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d Grand Canyon Tr. v. Bernhardt, 947 F.3d 94, 95 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2020) (per curiam).\n\nUnder the catalyst theory, the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that, but\n\nfor the plaintiff filing suit, the agency would not have performed the desired act, such as producing\n\nrecords. Id. at 97 (citations omitted); see Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Harris, 653 F.2d 584,\n\n587 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting this is a question of causation). Courts look at the totality of the\n\ncircumstances to determine whether there is a causal nexus between a plaintiff filing suit and an\n\nagency\u2019s change in position. See Conservation Force v. Jewell, 160 F. Supp. 3d 194, 202 (D.D.C.\n\n2016) (citation omitted). If factors unrelated to the lawsuit trigger an agency\u2019s disclosure, the\n\nplaintiff has not demonstrated causation and is not a prevailing party under the catalyst theory.\n\nGrand Canyon Tr. v. Zinke, 311 F. Supp. 3d 381, 389 (D.D.C. 2018), aff\u2019d sub nom. Grand Canyon\n\nTr., 947 F.3d 94.\n\nAlthough timing may be relevant in this analysis, a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a complaint and an\n\nagency\u2019s subsequent disclosure is not enough to show causation. See Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d\n\nat 97; see also Pub. L. Educ. Inst. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 744 F.2d 181, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating\n\nsomething \u201cmore than post hoc, ergo propter hoc must be shown\u201d). There must be \u201chard evidence\u201d\n\nbeyond timing that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit caused the agency to release documents or provide other\n\nrequested relief. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, the Court may\n\fconsider whether the agency had a reasonable amount of time to respond to a FOIA request before\n\nthe plaintiff filed suit. See First Look Inst. Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, No. 20-cv-3499,\n\n2024 WL 3744818, at *4 (D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2024) (collecting cases), report and recommendation\n\nadopted sub nom. First Look Media Works, Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, 2024 WL\n\n4262773 (D.D.C. Sept. 23, 2024), aff\u2019d sub nom. per curiam, First Look Inst., Inc. v. U.S. Agency\n\nfor Glob. Media, No. 24-5257, 2025 WL 1840647 (D.C. Cir. July 2, 2025) (unpublished). The\n\nCourt also considers whether unavoidable external factors caused an agency\u2019s delay, including\n\ninadvertent administrative constraints. See Env\u2019t Integrity Project v. United States Env\u2019t Prot.\n\nAgency, 316 F. Supp. 3d 320, 328 (D.D.C. 2018).\n\nB. Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\nEddington makes a half-hearted argument that he is eligible for fees under the catalyst\n\ntheory.2 ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. His only meaningful argument is that the lawsuit caused\n\na \u201csudden acceleration\u201d of the DOJ\u2019s production. ECF No. 50 at 4. Under that theory, Eddington\n\npoints to two pieces of alleged \u201chard evidence.\u201d Id. at 5-6. He asserts that the DOJ \u201cimmediately\n\nbegan processing\u201d his request once he filed suit because the DOJ stated in the Parties\u2019 first JSR\n\nthat the agency was in the process of conducting searches. ECF Nos. 1; 50 at 5; see also ECF No.\n\n11 \u00b6 2. Relying on the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report,3 Eddington contrasts the nearly four-month\n\nperiod between his May 15, 2019 FOIA request and the Parties\u2019 first JSR, with the DOJ\u2019s average\n Indeed, he devoted only two paragraphs in his opening Motion to this argument.\n Each fiscal year, agencies must publicly report certain statistical information concerning\ntheir FOIA processes to the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Government\nInformation Services. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e). Courts in this District have relied on these reports\nin FOIA cases. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. C.I.A., 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 259 n.14 (D.D.C. 2012),\naff\u2019d, 969 F.3d 406 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\n\fprocessing time in the NSD of over one year for \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests.4 ECF No. 50 at 5\u20136.\n\nEddington claims that the disparity between the average processing time and the time it took for\n\nthe DOJ to start processing his FOIA request shows that it is \u201clikely\u201d that the DOJ would not have\n\nprocessed his request as soon as it did absent this lawsuit. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135.\n\nEddington also asserts that the DOJ failed to provide evidence of its pre-suit processing steps.\n\nECF No. 52 at 4\u20135.\n\nThe DOJ argues that Eddington fails to provide any \u201cevidence that this suit caused [the\n\nDOJ] to change what it already was doing with respect to the FOIA request.\u201d ECF No. 51 at 8.\n\nThe DOJ first argues that it is not the case that the agency failed to communicate with Eddington\n\nprior to his lawsuit because the agency let him know it was processing the request. Id. at 7. The\n\nDOJ sent a letter on June 17, 2019, informing Eddington that it would process his request as\n\nquickly as possible consistent with the agency\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and the administrative\n\ndemands of the request. Id. at 7, 10\u201311; see also ECF No. 50-1 at 6. Second, the DOJ argues that\n\nthe DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report does not provide any conclusive evidence of a \u201csudden acceleration\u201d\n\nin this case. ECF No. 51 at 11\u201312. Among other things, the agency points out that the Report\n\nsimply provides averages from one fiscal year, which necessarily means that there were requests\n\nthat were processed in less time than the average. Id. at 11. The agency also points out that the\n\nReport fails to account for other \u201cunforeseen contingent events that may operate to quicken or slow\n\ndown the processing of a FOIA request.\u201d Id. The DOJ also notes that Eddington\u2019s argument\n\nhinges entirely on FOIA statistics from 2019 despite the DOJ not completing processing in this\n\ncase until January 2023. Id. at 12.\n See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., United States Department of Justice Annual Freedom of\nInformation Act Report: Fiscal Year 2019 34 (2019) (\u201c2019 FOIA Report\u201d),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1253751/dl?inline=.\n\f C. Discussion\n\nEddington has failed to establish that it is more probable than not that his lawsuit caused\n\nthe DOJ to change its pre-suit position on his FOIA request. Eddington asks the Court to find that\n\nhe has substantially prevailed in this lawsuit based solely on the proposition that the NSD\u2019s average\n\ntime in 2019 for fully processing a complex FOIA request was greater than the time it took for the\n\nagency to start processing Eddington\u2019s request. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that this alleged disparity establishes the DOJ \u201csuddenly accelerated\u201d processing\n\nbecause Eddington filed suit. ECF No. 50 at 4.\n\nCourts in this District have concluded that an agency\u2019s \u201csudden acceleration\u201d in processing\n\na FOIA request after a plaintiff files suit may show that the lawsuit caused the agency to change\n\nits position. Terris, Pravlik & Millian, LLP v. Cents. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., 794 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 29, 38 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Crooker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 663 F.2d 140 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1980)). This necessarily means that a plaintiff must first show that the agency initially took\n\nan adverse position on the FOIA request or engaged in an unexplained delay before the plaintiff\n\nfiled suit. See First Look Media Works, Inc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *4. A plaintiff must then\n\nprove that \u201cthe agency did in fact accelerate its response to the FOIA request because of the\n\nlawsuit.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Eddington does not make either showing.\n\nEddington fails to show that the DOJ initially took an adverse position on his FOIA request\n\nor engaged in a significant and unexplained pre-suit delay. See Am. Wild Horse Campaign v. U.S.\n\nBureau of Land Mgmt., No. 22-cv-3061, 2024 WL 3967256, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 26, 2024) (noting\n\nthat an agency\u2019s significant delay can support an inference that the agency forgot about or ignored\n\nthe request). Although the DOJ does not provide a declaration explaining its pre-suit processing,\n\nEddington\u2019s own evidence shows that the agency was aware of his FOIA request. ECF No. 50-1\n\fat 6. The agency sent Eddington a response within thirty-three days of his FOIA request. Id. \u00b6 10.\n\nIn that pre-suit letter, the agency informed Eddington that it would process his request as quickly\n\nas possible in line with the DOJ\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and other administrative demands. Id.\n\nat 6; see Grand Canyon Tr., 311 F. Supp. 3d at 390 (holding that plaintiff was not eligible for fees\n\ndespite the agency\u2019s failure to produce a declaration). Accordingly, this is not a case in which the\n\nagency ignored the FOIA request, took an adverse pre-suit position, or delayed significantly in\n\ngetting back to Eddington.\n\nMoreover, Eddington filed suit only fifty-eight days after making his FOIA request and\n\nonly twenty-five days after the agency first responded to him. ECF No. 50-1 at \u00b6 10. This further\n\nundermines the argument that there was some supposed pre-suit delay. First Look Media Works,\n\nInc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *5; Am. Wild Horse Campaign, 2024 WL 3967256, at *1, *3 (finding\n\nthe plaintiff was not eligible for fees despite the agency failing to communicate pre-suit with the\n\nplaintiff for eight months after confirming receipt). Eddington cannot manufacture a \u201csudden\n\nacceleration\u201d simply by rushing to file suit and then claiming that the lawsuit caused the DOJ to\n\nsubsequently process and release documents. The timing of Eddington\u2019s lawsuit means that the\n\nagency would in any circumstance be producing documents after the suit was filed. Gov\u2019t\n\nAccountability & Oversight v. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, No. 23-cv-3268, 2024 WL 4828107, at *5\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 19, 2024). Eddington has failed to show that the DOJ was doing anything but\n\nproceeding business as usual on his FOIA request before he filed suit. Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe\n\nof Indians v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 750 F.2d 117, 120 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\u201cAbsent any evidence on\n\nthe matter, the natural inference is that the [defendant] was simply responding to the [plaintiff\u2019s]\n\nrequest.\u201d).\n\f Eddington also fails to show that the DOJ suddenly accelerated processing his FOIA\n\nrequest because of his lawsuit. In determining whether an agency would have taken longer to\n\nproduce responsive records absent a lawsuit, the Court may compare the agency\u2019s processing time\n\nfor a specific FOIA request against the agency\u2019s average processing time for similar requests. See,\n\ne.g., Gov\u2019t Accountability & Oversight, 2024 WL 4828107, at *4. Eddington errs, however, in\n\nattempting to make an apples-to-apples comparison between his case and the average processing\n\ntime for 2019 \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests. First, Eddington merely assumes without any support\n\nthat his case qualifies as \u201ccomplex\u201d as the agency defined that term for inclusion of cases in the\n\n2019 report.5 See 2019 FOIA Report at 34 (recording that the NSD had an average processing\n\ntime of approximately 110 days for simple FOIA request versus an average of approximately 418\n\ndays for complex FOIA requests). Second, Eddington does not account for the fact that, even if\n\nhis case did qualify as \u201ccomplex,\u201d the report still presents only an average number, necessarily\n\nmeaning that there were complex cases which were processed faster than the average.\n\nThird, the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report captures the average time the DOJ took to complete\n\nprocessing for a FOIA request, not the time it took to initiate processing. See id. at 5 (defining a\n\nprocessed FOIA request as \u201ca request . . . for which an agency has taken final action in all\n\nrespects\u201d). As Eddington acknowledges, the DOJ did not complete processing for his FOIA\n\nrequest until January 11, 2023, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. ECF Nos. 41; 50 at 5 n.2; 51-\n\n2. The DOJ, therefore, took approximately 1,337 days to process Eddington\u2019s FOIA request.\n\nEddington does not offer any explanation to account for the fact that this 1,377-day processing\n\ntime was actually longer than the 418-day average upon which he relies. Finally, Eddington does\n In the 2019 FOIA Report, the DOJ defines a complex request as \u201ca FOIA request that an\nagency using multi-track processing places in a slower track based on the high volume and/or\ncomplexity of the records requested.\u201d See 2019 FOIA Report at 5.\n\fnot provide any evidence that, absent the Covid-19 pandemic, the DOJ would have completed\n\nprocessing his request much faster than this 418-day average. See Harrington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\n\nHealth & Hum. Servs., No. 20-cv-2671, 2022 WL 17555428, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 9, 2022)\n\n(concluding the plaintiff was ineligible for fees despite the agency completing processing \u201ca few\n\nmonths faster\u201d than the agency\u2019s estimated completion date).\n\nIn sum, Eddington has not shown that the DOJ initially engaged in an unexplained delay\n\nbefore he filed suit or that his lawsuit caused the DOJ to suddenly accelerate processing for his\n\nFOIA request. Eddington does not provide hard evidence that he substantially prevailed in this\n\nlitigation beyond the fact that the DOJ processed his FOIA request and produced documents after\n\nhe filed suit. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, Eddington is not eligible\n\nfor attorneys\u2019 fees. Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d at 97 (citations omitted). Because Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that he is eligible for fees, the Court need not consider whether he is entitled to fees\n\nor if his requested award is reasonable.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nDate: July 23, 2025\n\n___________________________________\n MOXILA A.

Part One of request\n\nsought records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the total number of labor hours worked during that period,\n\nand Part Two demanded records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the hours devoted \u201cto investigations of\n\nany and all matters related to left wing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist\n\nagendas-anarchists like Antifa and other agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Def.\u2019s\n\nMot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 13 [hereinafter Def.\u2019s Mot.], Decl. of Michael G. Seidel, ECF No.\n\n13-1 [hereinafter Seidel Decl.], \u00b6 5, Ex. A. The FBI produced a one-page record in response to the\n\nfirst part of the request, but as to the second advised Plaintiff:\n\nThe FOIA does not require federal agencies to answer inquiries,\n create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions concerning\n queried data. Rather the FOIA requires agencies to provide access\n to reasonably described, nonexempt records. The questions posed\n\f in the referenced letter are not FOIA requests because they do not\n comply with the FOIA and its regulations. Therefore, your request\n is being administratively closed.\n\nId., Ex. F.\n\nDefendant moves for summary judgment. See Def.\u2019s Mot. Plaintiffs do not contest the\n\nagency\u2019s response to Part One of the request. Mem. in Support of Pls.\u2019 Mot. in Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s\n\nMot., ECF No. 19 [hereinafter Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n], at 2 n.1. Their dispute concerns Part Two. At issue is\n\nwhether Plaintiffs properly exhausted administrative remedies as to that portion of the demand,\n\nand whether Defendant conducted an adequate search for records. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 8\u201310; Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n\n\nat 9\u201311.\n\nThe court finds that Defendant performed an adequate search with respect to Part Two of\n\nthe request. It therefore does not reach the exhaustion issue. See Hidalgo v. FBI, 344 F.3d 1256,\n\n1258 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (stating that \u201cthe exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional because the\n\nFOIA does not unequivocally make it so\u201d). Accordingly, the court will enter judgment in favor of\n\nDefendant.\n\nII.\n\nTo demonstrate it conducted an adequate search, an \u201cagency must show that it made a good\n\nfaith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably\n\nexpected to produce the information requested.\u201d Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 920 F.2d 57,\n\n68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The agency must provide a \u201creasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the\n\nsearch terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain\n\nresponsive materials (if such records exist) were searched.\u201d Id. An agency affidavit is accorded a\n\npresumption of good faith if it is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory, and . . . submitted in\n\ngood faith.\u201d Eddington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 35 F.4th 833, 837 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting\n\fSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). That presumption cannot be\n\novercome with \u201cpurely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of [the request].\u201d\n\nId. (quoting SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200) (alteration in original). The plaintiff must provide\n\n\u201c\u2018countervailing evidence\u2019 as to the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\u201d Iturralde v. Comptroller of\n\nthe Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted). \u201cIf a review of the\n\nrecord raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of well defined requests and positive\n\nindications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is inappropriate.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nIn this case, Defendant\u2019s declaration from Michael Seidel is entitled to a presumption of\n\ngood faith. It is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory\u201d and explains why the FBI produced no\n\nrecords in response to Part Two of the request. See Eddington, 35 F.4th at 837; Seidel Decl.,\n\nSeidel is the Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the FBI.\n\nSeidel Decl. \u00b6 1. He states that, to identify responsive information, the agency turned to the\n\nPerformance Management Unit (PMU), Resources Planning Office, in the Office of the Associate\n\nDeputy Director. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 23. Seidel explains:\n\nPMU is responsible for organizing and making management data\n accessible to the FBI to impact decisions on program management,\n resource allocation and organizational planning. PMU structures\n and arranges information related to various aspects of the FBI\n operations and resources, and ensures that crucial data is readily\n available and easily retrievable when needed.\n\nId. PMU advised that its ability to report validated hours for specific cases assigned to the\n\nWashington Field Office was \u201climited.\u201d Id. \u00b6 26. FBI agents record hours worked on cases and\n\nassociate certain classification codes, but \u201cthere is no tracking mechanism for distinguishing cases\n\nrelated to specific events.\u201d Id. There is no classification code associated with matters such as \u201cleft\n\nwing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist agendas-anarchists like Antifa and\n\nother agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Id. To fulfill Part Two of the request, the\n\fFBI \u201cwould be required to answer inquiries, create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions\n\nconcerning queried data which are not required under FOIA.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27. The FBI \u201cdoes not\n\nmaintain the specific data sought by Plaintiffs\u201d in Part Two of their request. Id. \u00b6 32.\n\nPlaintiffs submit two critiques of the search. First, grasping on to the word \u201climited,\u201d which\n\nPMU used to describe its capacity to retrieve labor hours data about specific events, Plaintiffs\n\nassert that the declaration lacks sufficient specificity to establish that responsive data does not\n\nexist. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10. But that contention overlooks Seidel\u2019s explanation that \u201cto fulfill\n\nPlaintiffs[\u2019] request\u201d the agency would have to sift through the available data, analyze it, drawn\n\ninferences from it, and create a new record. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 27. The declaration leaves no room for\n\ndoubt that data responsive to Part Two does not independently exist.\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs fault the agency for not inquiring into whether the data sought \u201cmay have\n\nalready been compiled\u201d in some other form. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. As Plaintiffs put it: \u201c[T]he FBI\n\nappears to only have searched for source data to produce \u2018records sufficient to show\u2019; it appears\n\nthey did not search for compilations of that data that answer the same question.\u201d Id. at 11.\n\nBut Plaintiffs offer no \u201ccountervailing evidence\u201d to believe that such a compilation exists. They\n\ndo not assert that the FBI \u201cfailed to search particular offices or files where the document might\n\nwell have been found.\u201d Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315. They do not contend that the agency \u201cfailed\n\nor refused to interview government officials for whom there was strong evidence that they might\n\nhave been helpful in finding the missing documents.\u201d Id. And Plaintiffs point to no \u201cevidence\n\nthat would indicate that at the time the Department searched its files there was reason to believe\u201d\n\nthat a responsive compilation of data was contained in the files. Id.; see Eddington, 35 F.4th at\n\n838 (describing Iturralde as \u201clisting ways government affidavit or declaration could be\n\ninadequate\u201d).\n\f In the end, Plaintiffs merely speculate that a report or some other record exists that contains\n\nthe highly specific information that they seek: verified labor hours spent by (1) a particular FBI\n\nfield office (2) during a defined three-month period (3) on investigations into left-wing domestic\n\nterrorist groups like Antifa and \u201cother agitators\u201d that (4) arose out of \u201cthe summer 2020 riots.\u201d\n\nSee Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. Plaintiffs\u2019 supposition that such a data compilation might exist is not\n\nenough to raise substantial doubt about the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court grants Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nECF No. 13. A final, appealable order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nDated: July 23, 2025 Amit P. Mehta\n United States District Judge\n\n5"

For the following reasons, we grant Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s writ application for the limited purpose of ordering the trial court to\n\nconsider Ms. Toussaint\u2019s \u201cNotice of Intent to File Supervisory Writ (\u201cNotice of\n\nIntent\u201d) as a timely motion for appeal.\n\nRELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL\n HISTORY\n\nOn October 3, 2022, Nichele1 Spears died during a colonoscopy screening.\n\nOn June 1, 2023, her husband, Sean Toussaint, filed a request for the appointment\n\nof a medical review panel. The medical review panel rendered an opinion on July\n\n18, 2024, therein finding that a nurse and doctor breached the applicable standard\n\nof care during Nichele Spears\u2019 procedure. Shortly thereafter, on September 3,\n\n2024, Sean Toussaint also died. On October 15, 2024, the Orleans Parish Civil\n\nDistrict Court appointed Ms. Toussaint, the sister of Sean Toussaint, as the\n\nadministratrix of his succession. Only one week later, on October 22, 2024, Rhyan\n\n1 The name \u201cNicole\u201d also appears in Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application; but this Opinion\n\nwill use the name \u201cNichele\u201d because that is the name listed in the medical review panel opinion\nand the Petition for Damages, both of which are discussed later.\n\fSpears, who is the son of Nichele Spears, filed a Petition for Damages in Orleans\n\nParish Civil District Court against the nurse and doctor regarding his mother\u2019s\n\ndeath.\n\nSubsequently, on April 15, 2025, Ms. Toussaint filed her Motion to\n\nIntervene, whereby she contended she had an interest in intervening in Rhyan\n\nSpears\u2019 lawsuit pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091 because she had been appointed\n\nadministratix of Sean Toussaint\u2019s succession; was a surviving heir of Sean\n\nToussaint; and sought the same or similar relief as Rhyan Spears.2 As Ms.\n\nToussaint explained in her Motion to Intervene, prior to his death, Sean Toussaint\n\nhad initiated a wrongful death and survival action against the defendants named in\n\nRhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit. Ms. Toussaint asserted that as the administratrix of Sean\n\nToussaint\u2019s estate, she therefore had \u201cthe right and responsibility to sue on behalf\n\nof [the] estate to recover assets owed to it, defend against claims, and ensure the\n\nestate interests [were] protected in the succession process\u201d pursuant to La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 3196.3 Rhyan Spears, the defendant nurse, and the State of Louisiana on behalf\n\nof the defendant doctor each filed an opposition to Ms. Toussaint\u2019s Motion to\n\nIntervene and asked the trial court to dismiss it.\n\nOn June 12, 2025, the trial court conducted a hearing on Ms. Toussaint\u2019s\n\nMotion to Intervene. In a judgment dated June 17, 2025, the trial court denied Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s Motion to Intervene and dismissed it with prejudice. On July 7, 2025,\n\nMs. Toussaint filed her Notice of Intent. Therein, she specified that she was\n\n2 Regarding the ability to intervene, La.

On\n\nJuly 9, 2025, the trial court signed the order permitting Ms. Toussaint to seek\n\nsupervisory review but denied Ms. Toussaint\u2019s request for a stay of the\n\nproceedings. This Court received Ms. Toussaint\u2019s timely writ application on July\n\n16, 2025.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\nIn her writ application, Ms. Toussaint asserts two assignments of error:\n\n1. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that filing of a\n request for a Medical Review Panel under La. R.S. 40:1231.8\n does not constitute the legal initiation of a medical malpractice\n claim.\n\n2. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that an appointed\n administrator of a deceased claimant\u2019s estate did not have legal\n authority to continue a pending medical malpractice action\n initially filed by the decedent.\n\nIn our review of Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application, we realized a procedural issue\n\nthat must be addressed before this Court can consider the merits of these above\n\narguments.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIssue One: Whether a Writ Application was the Proper Procedural Vehicle for\nSeeking Review of the Trial Court\u2019s Judgment\n\nBy filing a writ application regarding the trial court\u2019s June 17, 2025\n\njudgment dismissing her Motion to Intervene, Ms. Toussaint sought to invoke this\n\nCourt\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction rather than our appellate jurisdiction. This Court\n\n\u201chas appellate jurisdiction of . . . all civil matters\u201d and \u201chas supervisory jurisdiction\n\nover cases which arise within its circuit.\u201d La. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 10. \u201cThis [C]ourt\u2019s\n\fappellate jurisdiction extends to final judgments identified as such by appropriate\n\nlanguage and to interlocutory judgments when expressly provided by law.\u201d First\n\nNBC Bank v.

Tammany Holding Co., 2016-1420 (La. App. 1 Cir. 6/2/17), 2017 WL\n\n2399020, *1). We begin our discussion with the question of whether a writ\n\napplication\u2014rather than an appeal\u2014was the proper procedural vehicle for Ms.\n\nToussaint to seek review of the judgment. To resolve this issue, we must determine\n\nif the trial court\u2019s judgment was appealable. If so, an appeal was the proper method\n\nfor seeking review instead of a writ application.\n\nWe find the relevant codal articles and jurisprudence interpreting them\n\nsupport a finding that a judgment dismissing a request to intervene is an appealable\n\njudgment. Defining the types of judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1841 states that a final\n\njudgment is one \u201cthat determines the merits in whole or in part.\u201d According to La.\n\nC.C.P. art. 2083, \u201c[a] final judgment is appealable in all causes in which appeals\n\nare given by law, whether rendered after hearing, by default, or by reformation\n\nunder [La. C.C.P. art.] 1814.\u201d Regarding final judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1915\n\nspecifies that a final judgment can be a partial one. That is,\n\nA. A final judgment may be rendered and signed by the court,\n even though it may not grant the successful party or parties all of the\n relief prayed for, or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case,\n when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to less than all of the parties,\n defendants, third party plaintiffs, third party defendants, or\n intervenors.\n\nLa. C.C.P. art. 1915 (A)(1). In interpreting La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) in Simmons\n\nv. Chambliss, the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal (\u201cSecond Circuit\u201d)\n\freviewed the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining exceptions of no right of action and\n\nno cause of action and dismissing the claims in intervention asserted by Anthony J.\n\nBruscato (\u201cMr. Bruscato\u201d). 37,461, p. 2 (La. App. 2 Cir. 8/20/03), 852 So.2d 1237,\n\n1238. Prior to considering the merits of the appeal, the Second Circuit ruled the\n\nappeal could proceed because the judgment was a final judgment as to Mr.\n\nBruscato under La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) since he had been dismissed from the\n\naction and was no longer a party thereto. Id. at p. 2, 852 So.2d at 1239.\n\nAdditionally, in Servi-Clean Industries, Inc. v. Tonti Management Corp., the\n\nLouisiana Supreme Court explained that a judgment dismissing an intervention is a\n\n\u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the contemplation of La. C.C.P. art. 1841 as it is a\n\ndetermination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding. 336 So.2d 799,\n\n805 (La. 1976).\n\nMoreover, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal has specifically held\n\nthat when a trial court denies a petition to intervene, this constitutes an appealable\n\njudgment. First NBC Bank, 2021-1209, p. 3, 341 So.3d at 829 (citations omitted).\n\nFurther, this Court has reviewed a trial court\u2019s judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene under its appellate jurisdiction. See generally Roy Anderson Corp. v. 225\n\nBaronne Complex, L.L.C., 2022-0784 (La. App. 4 Cir. 4/11/23), 360 So.3d 144;\n\nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 455 So.2d 1260 (La. App.\n\n4th Cir. 1984). In light of the foregoing, we find a judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene is an appealable judgment. Thus, an appeal was the proper method for\n\nMs. Toussaint to seek review of the trial court\u2019s judgment denying her Motion to\n\nIntervene, not an application for supervisory writ.\n\fIssue Two: How to Proceed with a Writ Application Seeking Review of an\nAppealable Judgment\n\nNext, we must consider how to proceed in light of our above holding that the\n\ntrial court\u2019s judgment was an appealable judgment for which Ms. Toussaint should\n\nhave filed an appeal rather than a writ application. In In re Howard, the Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court considered a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a writ application with the\n\nLouisiana Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal rather than an appeal regarding the\n\nunderlying appealable judgment. 541 So.2d 195 (La. 1989). The Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court explained the plaintiff made a mistake by seeking review of the\n\njudgment by supervisory writs rather than appeal. Id., 541 So.2d at 197. Noting,\n\nhowever, that the plaintiff filed her motion and order with the trial court within the\n\ndelay for taking a devolutive appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the\n\nmatter to the trial court with instructions to treat the plaintiff\u2019s notice of intent as a\n\nmotion for appeal and to grant the plaintiff an appeal from the judgment. Id.\n\nLike the plaintiff in In re Howard, Ms. Toussaint made a mistake when she\n\nsought review of the June 17, 2025 judgment by supervisory writs rather than by\n\nappeal because the judgment was appealable. Nevertheless, Ms. Toussaint filed her\n\nNotice of Intent and associated order well within the delays for taking an appeal.\n\nLa. C.C.P. arts. 2087, 2121, 2123. Accordingly, and because \u201c[e]very pleading\n\nshall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\u201d we find the same approach\n\nutilized by the Louisiana Supreme Court in In re Howard is proper here. La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 865. Though Ms. Toussaint erroneously titled her pleading \u201cNotice of Intent to\n\nFile Supervisory Writ,\u201d the trial court should have disregarded the erroneous title,\n\ntreated the pleading as a timely motion for appeal, and granted the appropriate\n\norder. In the interest of justice, and because Ms. Toussaint was entitled to an\n\fappeal of the June 17, 2025 final judgment upon the timely filing of a pleading\n\nseeking review of that judgment, we remand the matter to the trial court to treat\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s July 7, 2025 pleading seeking review of the June 17, 2025\n\njudgment as a timely motion for appeal. In light of this, we pretermit discussion of\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s assignments of error.\n\nDECREE\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we grant Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application for the\n\nlimited purpose of remanding this matter to the trial court with instructions to grant\n\nMs. Toussaint an appeal from the June 17, 2025 judgment.\n\nWRIT GRANTED; REMANDED\n\n7"

FISCHER, J., concurred in\njudgment only.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nPer Curiam.\n {\u00b6 1} This is an election case concerning respondent Franklin County Board\nof Elections\u2019 certification of respondent Holly Stein\u2019s name for placement on the\nNovember 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a candidate for the Ward 4 seat on the\nWhitehall City Council. Relators, Lori Elmore and the City of Whitehall, contend\nthat the board erred in certifying Stein\u2019s name because, they say, she does not meet\nthe two-year residency requirement found in Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\nAs relief, relators request a writ of prohibition to prevent the board from placing\nStein\u2019s name on the ballot. We grant the writ.\n I. BACKGROUND\n {\u00b6 2} Whitehall is a municipal corporation located within Franklin County\nand is governed by a charter. Section 3(a) of the charter provides that \u201cCouncil\nmembers for wards shall have resided in their respective wards and Council\nmembers at large shall have resided in the City for at least two years next preceding\ntheir election.\u201d Whitehall Charter, \u00a7 3(a).\n {\u00b6 3} In January 2025, Stein filed with the board a declaration of candidacy\nand a petition seeking nomination to represent Ward 4 on the Whitehall City\nCouncil. The board later certified Stein\u2019s name for placement on the November 4,\n2025 general-election ballot. Elmore currently serves as an at-large member of the\nWhitehall City Council and is a qualified Whitehall elector.\n {\u00b6 4} In February 2025, Elmore filed a protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy,\nand the board held a hearing on Elmore\u2019s protest in March. At the hearing, Elmore\ncontended that the board should disqualify Stein from the ballot because she did\nnot meet Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year residency requirement. Elmore interpreted\nSection 3(a) as requiring ward candidates to have lived in their respective wards for\nthe two years prior to the election at issue, meaning that for purposes of the\nNovember 4, 2025 general election, Stein must have lived in Ward 4 since\nNovember 4, 2023. In support of her claim that Stein did not meet this requirement,\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nElmore pointed to, among other things, Stein\u2019s voting records. Elmore deduced\nfrom these records that Stein resided in Licking County\u2014and thus outside Ward 4\nand Whitehall\u2014throughout 2023.\n {\u00b6 5} Stein appeared at the protest hearing, admitted that she lived in\nLicking County throughout 2023, and argued that she should nonetheless remain a\nWard 4 candidate for the Whitehall City Council. Stein maintained that under this\ncourt\u2019s decision in State ex rel. Rocco v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2017-\nOhio-4466, the Whitehall Charter required only that she have resided in Ward 4 for\nany two-year period preceding the election. Because she lived in Ward 4 from 2019\nuntil 2022, she asserted, her candidacy complied with Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year\nresidency requirement. Alternatively, based on principles of grammar, she argued\nthat the requirement applied only to at-large candidates and that ward candidates\nneed only show that they resided in their ward at any preceding time. Stein argued\nthat because she resided in her ward before the November 4, 2025 general election,\nher candidacy complied with Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n {\u00b6 6} At the conclusion of the hearing, the board denied Elmore\u2019s protest.\n {\u00b6 7} Relators then filed this original action seeking a writ of prohibition to\nprevent the board from placing Stein\u2019s name on the ballot or, alternatively, a writ\nof mandamus ordering the board to grant Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s\ncandidacy. We denied relators\u2019 motion to expedite the case. 2025-Ohio-1090.\nAfter respondents each filed a motion to dismiss the action, we granted the motions\nas to relators\u2019 mandamus claim, denied the motions as to the prohibition claim, sua\nsponte ordered respondents to answer the complaint as to the prohibition claim, and\nsua sponte granted an alternative writ of prohibition, scheduling the submission of\nevidence and briefs. 2025-Ohio-1757.\n {\u00b6 8} The case is ripe for our decision on relators\u2019 prohibition claim.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n {\u00b6 9} To be entitled to a writ of prohibition, relators must show that (1) the\nboard has exercised quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power was\nunauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ would result in injury for which no\nadequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of the law. State ex rel. Elder v.\nCamplese, 2015-Ohio-3628, \u00b6 13. This court has observed that after a board of\nelections exercises its quasi-judicial power by denying a protest, relief in\nprohibition is available to prevent the placement of a name or issue on a ballot\nprovided that the election has not yet been held. See, e.g., Tatman v. Fairfield Cty.\nBd. of Elections, 2004-Ohio-3701, \u00b6 14.\n {\u00b6 10} There is no dispute that the board exercised quasi-judicial power by\ndenying Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy. Nor is there a dispute that\nrelators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law due to the\nproximity of the November 4 election. Still more, the parties do not dispute the\nrelevant facts. What remains to be decided, then, is a purely legal question\nconcerning the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n A. Rocco\u2019s dueling opinions and the meaning of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\n {\u00b6 11} Relators argue that under Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter, a\nward candidate for city council must have lived in her respective ward for at least\nthe two years immediately before the election at issue. Because Stein indisputably\ndid not live in Ward 4 during any part of 2023, they maintain, she should not have\nbeen certified for placement on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a\nWard 4 candidate.\n {\u00b6 12} Relators insist that their understanding of Section 3(a) is borne out\nby its plain meaning, thereby obviating the need for interpretation. They correctly\nobserve that when this court construes a city charter, general rules of statutory\ninterpretation apply. See State ex rel. Miller v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections,\n2021-Ohio-831, \u00b6 33. Thus, because the Whitehall Charter conveys an\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nunambiguous meaning, the argument runs, the charter must be applied rather than\ninterpreted. See Pelletier v. Campbell, 2018-Ohio-2121, \u00b6 14. But although\nrelators start their argument with an appeal to plain meaning, they immediately\npivot to parsing Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d against the\nbackdrop of how that phrase was understood by members of this court in Rocco,\n2017-Ohio-4466. In relators\u2019 view, Justice DeWine\u2019s dissenting opinion in that\ncase advanced the correct understanding of the phrase\u2014i.e., that \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as being synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\n {\u00b6 13} For their part, respondents urge us to follow the lead opinion in\nRocco, under which the phrases \u201cnext preceding\u201d and \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as having different meanings. Under respondents\u2019 view of\nSection 3(a), Stein need only have lived in Ward 4 for any two-year period\npreceding the upcoming election, not the period immediately preceding the\nelection. Respondents emphasize that under Section 23(a) of the Whitehall Charter,\nmayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City for three years\nimmediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they seek election.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Respondents maintain that had the charter\u2019s drafters intended\nfor Section 3(a) to mean what relators say it means, then the drafters would have\nused the same language for ward candidates that they used for mayoral candidates.\n {\u00b6 14} Because Rocco looms large in this case, we begin our analysis by\ndiscussing that case. At issue there was whether Andrea Rocco should appear on\nthe ballot as a candidate for the City of Westlake\u2019s law director. The Westlake\nCharter provided that\n\n\u201c[t]he Director of Law shall be a qualified elector at the time of his\n election, shall have been a resident of the City for at least eighteen\n (18) months immediately preceding his election, an attorney at law\n duly admitted to the practice of law before the courts of the State of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nOhio, and been engaged in the active practice of law in Ohio for a\n period of six (6) years next preceding his election.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Rocco at \u00b6 8 (lead opinion), quoting Westlake Charter,\nart. IV, \u00a7 4.\n {\u00b6 15} Multiple protests were brought against Rocco\u2019s candidacy, arguing\nthat because she had not practiced law for the six years immediately preceding the\nupcoming election, her candidacy was defective. The Cuyahoga County Board of\nElections sustained the protests, and Rocco then brought an original action in this\ncourt, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the board to place her name on the\nballot.\n {\u00b6 16} Four separate opinions resulted. Although a majority of the court\nvoted to grant the writ, the majority could not agree on a rationale. The lead\nopinion, authored by former Justice O\u2019Donnell and joined by former Justice French,\ndetermined that the Westlake Charter required only that candidates for law director\nhave been engaged in the active practice of law for any period of six years preceding\nthe election at issue. Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 2. Former Justice O\u2019Neill concurred\nin judgment only and authored an opinion addressing a separate issue that has no\nbearing on this case. See id. at \u00b6 23-24 (O\u2019Neill, J., concurring in judgment only).\nJustice Fischer concurred in judgment only without an opinion. Former Chief\nJustice O\u2019Connor dissented, opining that the charter required law-director\ncandidates to have been engaged in the active practice of law during the six-year\nperiod immediately preceding the election. Id. at \u00b6 35 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting).\nAnd Justice DeWine authored a dissent joined by then-Justice Kennedy, expressing\na view similar to the one advanced by former Chief Justice O\u2019Connor. See id. at\n\u00b6 52 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 17} In support of the court\u2019s judgment granting the writ, the lead opinion\nexplained that whereas the Westlake Charter uses the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d in\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nprescribing the practice-of-law requirement, it uses the phrase \u201cimmediately\npreceding\u201d in prescribing the residency requirement. Reasoning that the difference\nin wording must have been meant to convey a difference in meaning, the lead\nopinion inferred that the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d meant something different from\nthe phrase \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d especially because the two phrases appeared\nin \u201cclose proximity\u201d to each other. Id. at \u00b6 16. As the lead opinion put it, had the\ncharter\u2019s drafters intended to require candidates to have been engaged in the active\npractice of law during the six-year period immediately preceding the election at\nissue, they would have used wording to that effect, \u201c[b]ut they did not do so.\u201d Id.\nThe lead opinion also emphasized that under the charter, candidates had to have\npracticed law for \u201ca period of six (6) years\u201d rather than \u201cthe period of six (6) years.\u201d\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Id. at \u00b6 13, quoting Westlake Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 4.\nBecause \u201ca\u201d is an indefinite article conveying the sense of \u201cany,\u201d the lead opinion\nreasoned, the charter required only that candidates have been engaged in the\npractice of law for any six-year period preceding the election. See id. Last, the\nlead opinion invoked the policy principle that doubts should be resolved in favor of\nthose seeking office to enable the public to have the benefit of choice among all\nqualified persons. Id. at \u00b6 18.\n {\u00b6 18} The dissenters countered that the lead opinion\u2019s approach sapped the\nphrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d of its ordinary meaning. They pointed out that under\nseveral lexical sources, there was no linguistic daylight between \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38\n(DeWine, J., dissenting). As discussed below, they also observed that the Revised\nCode contains numerous instances in which it makes sense to construe \u201cnext\npreceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30-32\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 39-40 (DeWine, J., dissenting). And they also\nsaw a sensible policy reflected in their construction of the charter\u2014namely, that the\nvoters would be better served by a candidate currently engaged in the practice of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nlaw than by one whose practice had lain dormant. Id. at \u00b6 33 (O\u2019Connor, C.J.,\ndissenting); id. at \u00b6 51 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 19} The above discussion of Rocco raises the question whether we\nshould follow the lead opinion\u2019s analysis or the dissenters\u2019.1 A plurality opinion\ndoes not constitute binding authority, but a court may rely on a plurality opinion if\nit finds the opinion to be persuasive. NASCAR Holdings, Inc. v. Testa, 2017-Ohio-\n9118, \u00b6 18. For the reasons explained below, we decline to follow the Rocco lead\nopinion here.\n {\u00b6 20} As noted above, general rules of statutory interpretation apply in\ndiscerning the meaning of a city charter. Miller, 2021-Ohio-831, at \u00b6 33. Foremost\namong these rules is that \u201c\u2018[t]he words of a governing text are of paramount\nconcern, and what they convey, in their context, is what the text means.\u2019 \u201d State v.\nReed, 2020-Ohio-4255, \u00b6 17, quoting Scalia and Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts, 56 (2012). In the absence of a legislative definition\nor technical meaning, it is proper to use dictionaries to discern a word\u2019s plain and\nordinary meaning. See Rancho Cincinnati Rivers, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, 2021-Ohio-2798, \u00b6 21; see also Athens v. McClain, 2020-Ohio-5146, \u00b6 30\n(\u201cIn determining the \u2018common and ordinary meaning\u2019 of words, courts may look to\ndictionaries.\u201d); State v. Wells, 2001-Ohio-3, \u00b6 8 (\u201cTo determine the common,\neveryday meaning of a word, we have consistently used dictionary definitions.\u201d).\n {\u00b6 21} The lead opinion in Rocco strayed from these principles. As the\ndissenters noted, the lead opinion did not even try to discover the plain and ordinary\nmeaning of the words \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d Rocco, 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 27\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 43 (DeWine, J., dissenting). Rather, the lead\nopinion inferred that because the Westlake Charter used the phrases \u201cimmediately\n\n1. Although the Rocco lead opinion was followed in State ex rel. Nasal v. Miami Cty. Bd. of\nElections, 2021-Ohio-2993, \u00b6 10, and State ex rel. Emhoff v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2018-\nOhio-1660, \u00b6 20, Nasal was a plurality decision and Emhoff relied on Rocco\u2019s practice-of-law\nanalysis, which is not an issue in this case.\n\f January Term, 2025\n\npreceding\u201d and \u201cnext preceding\u201d in close proximity to each other, the phrases must\nhave different meanings. Before drawing this inference, however, the lead opinion\nshould have first consulted proper lexical sources to determine the meaning of\n\u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d See Rancho at \u00b6 21. Doing so establishes that \u201cnext\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately\u201d are synonymous, as the dissenters carefully demonstrated.\n {\u00b6 22} One source cited by the dissenters defined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38 (DeWine, J.,\ndissenting), citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002). Another\ndefined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201c[n]earest; closest; immediately following.\u201d (Emphasis in\noriginal.) Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting), citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n(6th Ed. 1990). And a thesaurus identified \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d as synonyms\nof \u201cnearest.\u201d Id., citing Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (4th Ed. 1977). What is\nmore, as Justice DeWine observed, decisions by Ohio courts pointed in the same\ndirection, deeming \u201cnext preceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 41 (DeWine, J., dissenting), citing Cincinnati v. Kirk, 20 Ohio\nApp. 452, 453 (1st Dist. 1925), and Mansfield v. Hunt, 10 Ohio C.D. 567, 569, 1900\nWL 1068 (5th Dist. 1900). The lead opinion failed to furnish any lexical authorities\nor decisions by Ohio courts cutting the other way. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 23} Citing several examples, the dissenters also showed that the Revised\nCode uses \u201cnext preceding\u201d synonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\nConsider two. First, Chief Justice O\u2019Connor cited a statute requiring prior notice\nof public auctions of personal property by either or both of two methods: (1) by\nplacing notice of the sale in a \u201c\u2018newspaper of general circulation in the county\nduring a period of fifteen days next preceding the sale\u2019 \u201d and/or (2) by posting an\nadvertisement in five public places where the sale would take place \u201c\u2018not less than\nfifteen days next preceding the sale.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 30 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting),\nquoting R.C. 2113.41(A). In either event, the property had to be sold \u201c\u2018at a fixed\nprice or for the best price obtainable.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting R.C. 2113.40. As Chief Justice\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nO\u2019Connor observed, under the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnext preceding,\u201d\nnotice of the auction could be provided years in advance. But that outcome would\nplainly frustrate the statute\u2019s goal of ensuring attendance at the auction and\nconcomitantly drive down the auction prices.\n {\u00b6 24} A second example of the Revised Code\u2019s use of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nsynonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d can be found in Justice DeWine\u2019s\nRocco dissent, which cites a statute concerning watershed-district budgets. He\nnoted that the statute\u2019s third paragraph requires certification of an annual budget to\nthe county commissioners and that its fourth paragraph directs the county\ncommissioners to perform specified duties \u201c\u2018[u]pon receipt of the certification\nunder the next preceding paragraph of this section.\u2019 \u201d Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 40\n(DeWine, J., dissenting), quoting R.C. 6105.08. Reading the two paragraphs\ntogether, Justice DeWine explained, \u201c[t]he fourth paragraph makes sense only if\n\u2018the next preceding paragraph\u2019 is the third paragraph, i.e., the immediately\npreceding paragraph.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 25} Unlike the dissents, the lead opinion in Rocco offers no examples\nfrom the Revised Code to support its interpretation of the Westlake Charter\nprovision at issue. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 26} The above discussion establishes that \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d and\n\u201cnext preceding\u201d are synonyms, and it undercuts the view expressed in the Rocco\nlead opinion that the phrases must have different meanings based on the canon\nknown as the presumption of consistent usage. That canon provides that \u201ca material\nvariation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.\u201d (Boldface deleted.) Reading\nLaw at 170. But although this court has invoked the canon in numerous decisions,\nsee, e.g., Metro. Secs. Co. v. Warren State Bank, 117 Ohio St. 69, 76 (1927); Obetz\nv. McClain, 2021-Ohio-1706, \u00b6 21, it is not ironclad. As Justice DeWine pointed\nout, the canon has been frowned on by no less than the late Justice Joseph Story of\nthe United States Supreme Court. Rocco at \u00b6 46 (DeWine, J., dissenting) (noting\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nthe criticism that the canon assumes an unrealistic level of perfection in legal\ndrafting). As with most canons, the presumption of consistent usage makes sense\nwhen applied \u201cpragmatically\u201d but may be overcome \u201cby context.\u201d Reading Law at\n171. For the reasons given in the dissenting opinions of Chief Justice O\u2019Connor\nand Justice DeWine, context should have trumped the presumption in Rocco.\n {\u00b6 27} Applying the logic of the Rocco dissenters here, we conclude that\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter requires that ward candidates for the\nWhitehall City Council have resided in their respective wards for at least the two\nyears immediately preceding the election at issue. The fact that Section 23(a) of\nthe charter specifies that mayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City\nfor three years immediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they\nseek election\u201d does not, as respondents argue, require a different result. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondents\u2019 view is that had the drafters of the charter intended to require\nward candidates to have been residents of their respective wards for a period of time\nimmediately prior to the election, as the charter provides with respect to mayoral\ncandidates, the drafters would have used wording to that effect. But that argument,\nwhich appeals to the presumption of consistent usage, fails for all the reasons\nexplained above. Moreover, unlike in Rocco, (1) the two competing phrases here\nare not in close proximity to each other and (2) Section 3(a) does not place the\nindefinite article \u201ca\u201d directly before the phrase \u201cnext preceding.\u201d Thus, even if we\nconsidered the lead opinion in Rocco persuasive, the difference between the\nstructure of the charter at issue in that case and the structure of the charter at issue\nhere would counsel against reliance on that opinion in this case.\n {\u00b6 28} The fact that we do not apply the presumption of consistent usage in\nthis case does not mean that it may never be invoked in a future case. Rather, as\nthe dissenters in Rocco explained, there will be some cases\u2014like this one\u2014in\nwhich the canon should be set aside. Indeed, because \u201c[n]o canon of interpretation\nis absolute,\u201d the force of a canon in any particular case \u201cmay be overcome by the\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nstrength of differing principles that point in other directions.\u201d (Boldface deleted.)\nReading Law at 59.\n {\u00b6 29} In the end, it is plain to us that the board\u2019s denial of Elmore\u2019s protest\nwas unauthorized by law because it failed to give proper effect to Section 3(a) of\nthe Whitehall Charter. Because Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nmeans \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d we conclude that Stein had to have resided in\nWard 4 for at least the two years immediately preceding the November 4, 2025\ngeneral election. Because Stein does not meet this requirement, she cannot appear\non the general-election ballot.\n B. Determining to whom the two-year residency requirement applies\n {\u00b6 30} Stein alone advances a more ambitious argument as to why we\nshould deny the writ. In her view, the two-year residency requirement of Section\n3(a) of the Whitehall Charter does not apply to her at all; rather, she says that the\nrequirement applies only to candidates running to be at-large members of the city\ncouncil. According to Stein, the requirement does not apply to ward candidates,\nbecause of the \u201cand\u201d that separates the reference to ward candidates from the\nreference to at-large candidates. By this logic, Stein need only have resided in\nWard 4 at some point in time for any period\u2014say, a day\u2014to qualify as a Ward 4\ncandidate. Because the parties do not dispute that Stein has previously resided in\nWard 4, adopting her argument would mean that her name should remain certified\nfor placement on the ballot.\n {\u00b6 31} Although courts use rules of grammar to determine the meaning of\nlegal texts, see Stiner v. Amazon, Inc., 2020-Ohio-4632, \u00b6 14, Stein fails to identify\na grammar principle that we could apply here to help determine whether, as she\nsays, the residency requirement modifies only the clause applicable to at-large\ncandidates. Instructive here is the series-qualifier canon, which provides that\n\u201c[w]hen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or\nverbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nentire series\u201d (boldface deleted), Reading Law at 147. The Reading Law treatise\noffers an illustration of this canon, explaining that the phrase \u201c[i]nstitutions or\nsocieties that are charitable in nature\u201d (italics deleted) should be understood as\nmeaning that \u201cthe institutions as well as the societies must be charitable.\u201d Id. at\n148 (calling this an example of a \u201cpostpositive modifier\u201d because the qualifying\nphrase is \u201cpositioned after\u201d what it modifies). Providing a second illustration, the\ntreatise says that a qualifying phrase should not carry over when a \u201cdeterminer (a,\nthe, some, etc.) [is] repeated before the second element.\u201d (Italics in original.) Id.\nThus, the phrase \u201c[t]he charitable institutions or the societies\u201d (italics deleted)\nshould be understood as meaning \u201cthat the societies need not be charitable\u201d due to\nthe presence of the second \u201cthe.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 32} In this case, Section 3(a)\u2019s constructions are parallel and there is no\ndeterminer before the second element, thus suggesting that the two-year residency\nrequirement applies both to ward candidates and to at-large candidates. We\nrecognize that Section 3(a) arguably does not fit neatly within the canon\u2019s technical\ndefinition, because the constructions at issue here are wordier than the examples in\nthe treatise and are not strictly composed of either all nouns or verbs in a series.\nBut another example, aided by a dose of pragmatism, helps explain why the\nunderlying logic of the canon should nonetheless apply here.\n {\u00b6 33} Suppose a school administrator were to say: \u201cMiddle-school\nstudents scheduled to participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their\nanswers at the microphone in room 101 and elementary-school students scheduled\nto participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their answers at the\nmicrophone in room 102 without the aid of a dictionary.\u201d It makes no sense to\nthink that the middle-school students are permitted to announce their answers by\nreading from a dictionary but that the elementary-school students are not. By\nsimilar logic, it makes no sense to think that Section 3(a) permits interloping ward\ncandidates but forbids interloping at-large candidates. Plainly, both types of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\ncandidates are expected to be responsive to their constituents and attuned to their\ninterests, and the two-year residency requirement promotes that goal.\n {\u00b6 34} In sum, we conclude that the two-year residency requirement of\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter applies both to ward candidates and to at-\nlarge candidates for the Whitehall City Council.\n III. CONCLUSION\n {\u00b6 35} Because Stein\u2019s candidacy does not comply with Section 3(a) of the\nWhitehall Charter, we grant a writ of prohibition preventing the board from placing\nher name on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot.\n Writ granted.\n _________________\n McTigue & Colombo, L.L.C., J.

The Tennessee Department of\nChildren\u2019s Services (\u201cDCS\u201d) filed a petition in the Juvenile Court for Hawkins County\n(\u201cthe Juvenile Court\u201d) seeking to terminate the parental rights of Rikiya P. (\u201cMother\u201d) to\nher minor children Annabelle, Jasmine, and Liam (\u201cthe Children,\u201d collectively), as well as\nthe parental rights of Daniel R. (\u201cFather\u201d) to Liam.1 The Children had been removed from\nMother and Father\u2019s custody because Mother starved and beat Kenna, Father\u2019s daughter\nby another mother.2 Father was aware of the abuse but failed to protect Kenna. The\nJuvenile Court terminated Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of severe\nchild abuse. Mother and Father appeal. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground\nof severe child abuse was proven against Mother and Father by clear and convincing\nevidence. We find further, as did the Juvenile Court, that clear and convincing evidence\nsupports termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as being in the best interest\nof the Children. We affirm.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Juvenile Court Affirmed;\n Case Remanded\n\nD. MICHAEL SWINEY, C.J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J.

Subsequently, counsel for Aaron P. filed a motion in this Court seeking dismissal of the appeal\nbased on his client\u2019s lack of participation. We granted the motion and dismissed this appeal as to Aaron P.\nIn this Opinion, we address only Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights.

In addition, as this is a parental rights case, we refrain from\nusing the full names of children and their relatives.\n Kenna has since reached majority age.\n\fNicholas S. Davenport, V, Kingsport, Tennessee, for the appellant, Rikiya P.\n\nEmily C. Morley, Rogersville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Daniel R.3\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter, and Mara L. Cunningham, Assistant\nAttorney General, for the appellee, the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services.\n\nOPINION\n\nBackground\n\nMother is the mother of Annabelle, born May 2013; Jasmine, born June 2014; and\nLiam, born December 2019. Aaron P. is the father of Annabelle and Jasmine. Father is\nthe father of Liam. Father has an older daughter, Kenna, by another mother. At the\ninception of this case, Mother, Father, Aaron P., the Children, and Kenna all lived under\nthe same roof. In May 2021, Kenna, then age sixteen, tried to run away. A neighbor\nstopped Kenna and returned her. Law enforcement later performed a welfare check but\ndid not see Kenna. That night, law enforcement returned. Mother and Father told the\nofficers that Kenna was away visiting a relative. That was false. Law enforcement found\nKenna hiding under a bed. She was bruised, emaciated, and had a shaved head. Afterward,\nthe Children and Kenna were removed into state custody. DCS filed a petition for\ndependency and neglect, but it was never adjudicated.\n\nOn May 25, 2022, DCS filed a petition seeking to terminate Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s\nparental rights to their respective children. Kenna has since reached majority age. DCS\nproceeded against Mother and Father on the ground of severe child abuse. Trial on DCS\u2019s\npetition was on November 29, November 30, and December 1, 2023. We proceed to review\nthe pertinent testimony from trial. Both Mother and Father declined to testify, invoking\ntheir rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nDr. Andrew Steven Wilt (\u201cDr. Wilt\u201d), an expert witness and the doctor who treated\nKenna after her removal, testified by deposition. Kenna suffered from \u201csevere\nmalnutrition.\u201d Kenna\u2019s weight for her age was less than the bottom first percentile, as was\nher body mass index. Dr. Wilt said it was most medically reasonable that Kenna\u2019s\nmalnutrition was not due to anything Kenna had done to herself but was the result of her\nbeing denied enough food. Kenna weighed 83 pounds when she was admitted to the\nhospital. Kenna had shown signs of \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d in which a malnourished\nperson does not properly handle the reintroduction of proper nutrients, which in turn can\n Father\u2019s previous attorney, Gerald T. Eidson, submitted Father\u2019s appellate brief.\n -2-\n\flead to death. In addition to starvation, Kenna showed signs of having been abused\nphysically, including facial bruising; a subconjunctival hemorrhage (a bleed in the white\npart of one\u2019s eye); bruises on her back; and bruises on her scapula. Kenna told Dr. Wilt\nthat Mother had hit her with a broom and a dustpan. Kenna also reported that she had lived\nunder strict rules about eating and drinking. For breakfast, she tended to have pack of\noatmeal. She was allowed to eat ramen or Chef Boyardee for lunch and dinner. Despite\nthese meager offerings, Kenna remained hungry. When the home ran out of oatmeal, she\nwas given a protein drink instead. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s malnourishment was\nsuch that it was likely to cause severe bodily injury or death. In Dr. Wilt\u2019s view, a\nreasonably prudent medical professional who saw Kenna in the condition she was in would\nhave made a referral.\n\nLisa Hawryluk (\u201cHawryluk\u201d), a DCS caseworker, took the stand to testify. Father\ntold Hawryluk that Kenna had done this to them, and he did not want her back in his home.\nMother likewise blamed Kenna. The thrust of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s positions was that\nthe family\u2019s problems were brought about by Kenna\u2019s bad behavior, not their parenting.\nHawryluk said that Kenna, now out of the family home, was glad to drink something\nbesides water and consumed whatever was given to her. On cross-examination, Hawryluk\nacknowledged that the Children appeared clean and did not have any marks visible.\n\nRetired detective Jeff Greer (\u201cGreer\u201d) testified. Greer saw Kenna at Mother\u2019s and\nFather\u2019s home in her malnourished state. Kenna appeared \u201cvery emaciated\u201d to Greer. She\nwas bruised around one eye and her head. According to Greer, the other children did not\nlook emaciated. Father told Greer that Kenna \u201creally didn\u2019t eat,\u201d but admitted they used\nfood as a punishment. Mother, in turn, told Greer that Kenna refused to eat. Corporal\nAnthony Crosby (\u201cCrosby\u201d) of the Hawkins County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified, as well.\nCrosby said that Kenna looked \u201cseverely abused.\u201d She had a black eye and looked like she\nwas \u201cliterally starving to death.\u201d\n\nConstance Cole (\u201cCole\u201d), a former DCS worker, testified next. Cole previously\nworked on the Children\u2019s case. Cole said that the Children were placed in a home together\nwhile Kenna was placed in a separate home. Cole acknowledged that Mother and Father\nhave a parental attachment to the Children but said that it is not of a healthy kind.\nAnnabelle broke down and cried at the first parental visitation. Cole said that she did not\nbelieve this was due to Annabelle missing her parents. In fact, Annabelle said that she was\nscared because \u201cthey beated me.\u201d However, Cole acknowledged that some of the visits\nwent well. Visitation remained supervised. Annabelle and Jasmine told Cole that they\nwere fearful of returning home. Annabelle and Jasmine said that the parents had been mean\nto Kenna. With respect to positive steps taken by Mother and Father, Cole testified that\nthey had housing and jobs. They also underwent parenting classes. All the same, in Cole\u2019s\nview, the Children should be freed for adoption. Cole explained why this was her view:\n -3-\n\f The abuse that Kenna received while in their care. I would be afraid that\n other children would face that same abuse and the older they get they would\n face the same abuse and it was horrific. Every time I met with Kenna she\n was vibrant and I never saw the things that were described to me by the\n Defendants in her. I never saw the attitudes or any of that in her. I saw a\n thriving young lady. I would be fearful for the other children.\n\nSchool counselor Jason Floyd (\u201cFloyd\u201d) testified. Regarding Annabelle and\nJasmine, Floyd said: \u201cOn a couple occasions separately and every now and again they\nwould want to come in together. They would say they are starving us and not giving us\nany food. When I would ask questions to explore that further they wouldn\u2019t say anything\nelse.\u201d Floyd said that Annabelle was very anxious early on, and Jasmine exhibited\ndisruptive behaviors. In addition, Tracy Burke (\u201cBurke\u201d), a CASA volunteer who worked\nwith the Children, testified. Annabelle told Burke that Mother pulled her hair, slapped her\nin the face or legs, and withheld food from her. Even still, Annabelle said that this was\n\u201cnothing like what they had seen done to Kenna.\u201d Annabelle also reported that Father once\npulled a gun on Kenna.\n\nLarissa J., Kenna\u2019s foster mother, testified.4 Kenna came to live with Larissa J. in\nMay 2021. According to Larissa J., Kenna initially looked \u201cvery frail and skinny.\u201d\nKenna\u2019s head was shaved, and she had a lot of bruises. When Kenna came to live with\nLarissa J., she ate regularly. Kenna then weighed between 80 and 90 pounds. Since then,\nshe has risen to around 140 pounds. Larissa J. enrolled Kenna in school. Kenna did not\nhave any high school credits when she was enrolled. Nevertheless, Kenna has since\ngraduated and has a job.\n\nKenna testified next. Kenna, age 19 at trial, is Father\u2019s daughter. Kenna was asked\nto describe a typical day in Mother and Father\u2019s home. According to Kenna, she woke up\n\u201csuper early,\u201d went to the living room to sit all day, and then went to bed. Mother made\nKenna sit on the floor in a certain precise way as a form of punishment. If Kenna failed to\ndo so, Mother hit her or yelled at her. Kenna needed permission to use the restroom.\nOtherwise, an alarm went off signaling that she could go. Kenna had no television or\ncomputer. For breakfast, she had one bowl of plain oatmeal. This was not by Kenna\u2019s\nchoice. For lunch, she was allowed to have canned soup or Chef Boyardee. It was not\nheated; she had to eat it out of the can. Dinner was the same. If Kenna asked for more,\nMother yelled at her. Kenna could drink only water. Meanwhile, cameras monitored\nKenna in the home. Kenna testified that Father threatened her with a gun twice. Kenna\nwas asked if Father ever tried to protect her from Mother. Kenna said that Father did \u201ca\n Larissa J.\u2019s first name is spelled Larisa in some parts of the record.\n -4-\n\fcouple of times,\u201d but he told her it was not for her benefit, but to protect Mother from\ngetting in trouble.\n\nOn cross-examination, Kenna said that her own mother left her when she was a year\nor a year-and-a-half old, and Mother was at one time a mother figure to her. Asked why\nshe did not climb out of her bedroom window to find food, Kenna said that the window\nwas screwed shut. Kenna acknowledged certain correspondence in which she admitted to\nbeing stubborn. Kenna also said that Mother was \u201cjust a typical mom\u201d to Annabelle and\nJasmine.\n\nMike Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), the Children\u2019s DCS case manager, testified. Smith said that\nthe Children are doing well in foster care. Jasmine and Annabelle were two years behind\nin school, based on their prior lack of education. However, they have made significant\nimprovements. Regarding the Children\u2019s attachment to Mother and Father, Smith testified:\n\nQ. Would you be able to tell the Court if you believe there is a secure and\n healthy parental attachment between these children and the parents?\n A. This is a difficult situation. Annabelle and Jasmine both have disclosed\n that they both don\u2019t want to have any contact with their mother. There are\n certainly concerns there. They both have disclosed that they love their father\n and they would like to see their father. I have seen an attachment there in\n those visits. Liam due to his age obviously he recognizes his mother and\n father. He likes seeing them and he is excited to see them. The question I\n have wondered about with the attachment factor with Liam and generally\n when I see a two or three year old at the end of visits whenever there is some\n kind of separation from the visits a child will normally scream, cry, it is\n usually a traumatic experience to separate the child from the visit. We never\n have that issue with Liam. He is happy to go. He is happy to come and\n happy to go. That has always been an odd situation.\n\nSmith testified that while Father was engaged during the visits, Mother tended to\nuse her phone on the couch. Smith acknowledged that Mother and Father paid child\nsupport. Asked if Mother or Father had undergone a mental health intake, Smith said:\n\nThere is some question with that. I have requested documentation. It is not\n to my liking but it is to her credit, [Mother] has sent me a screen shot of a\n piece of paper from her therapist, but as far as ongoing or what is being\n discussed in therapy, I don\u2019t have any knowledge of it. [Father] has reported\n that he is going to Camelot. I haven\u2019t had any verification from that. I think\n it was Camelot and I may be mistaken as far as the provider but he has\n reported that he is receiving therapy. . . .\n -5-\n\fAt a February 2023 visit, Jasmine locked herself in a bathroom crying that Mother abused\nthem. Jasmine threatened to kill herself. She also threatened to stab Mother if she had to\nsee her again. After this incident, Jasmine spent a week in the hospital. Mother\u2019s visits\nwith Annabelle and Jasmine were suspended.\n\nNext at trial, Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s employer testified favorably about Mother and\nFather. In addition, Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., testified favorably about Mother and\nFather, as well. Pamela P. testified, in effect, that Kenna\u2019s bad behavior was the problem\nin the household, not Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parenting. When confronted with photographs\nof Kenna, Pamela P. testified:\n\nQ. You stated that you left in March, 2021, is that correct?\n A. That\u2019s correct.\n Q. Can you look at this picture and see if that is how Kenna looked when you\n left?\n A. Well, she has her pick marks. I was not here for this picture and that\n timing exactly. I have seen her have injuries before from nobody being at\n home.\n THE COURT: She asked you if that is how she looked when you left?\n A. When I last saw her?\n THE COURT: Yes.\n A. No. She was thin and she had pick marks but, no, I didn\u2019t see this.\n THE COURT: Thank you.\n Q. Same thing. Did she look like this when you left? Is that her haircut that\n she had when you left?\n A. No, Ma\u2019am, but it is the haircut she described that she wanted.\n Q. Oh, it is?\n A. Yes.\n Q. Okay, that is what she said she wanted her hair to look like?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. Okay, thank you. Did she have black eyes when you last saw her and is\n that an injury she would have inflicted upon herself?\n A. Twice. One time she had one black eye and the second time she had two\n and no one was there all day. She didn\u2019t expect to see me.\n Q. Did you ask her about her injuries?\n A. Oh, I had an accident and she would go hide in her room.\n Q. Are you aware that both Annabelle and Jasmine have made statements\n that they also had food restrictions in the home of your daughter?\n A. I am not aware but I know better.\n Q. You don\u2019t believe the children are saying that?\n -6-\n\f A. I believe I have broken children that never got the help they wanted and\n they could be coerced in any way.\n Q. You believe these children are being coerced?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. What evidence do you have of them being coerced?\n A. What evidence do I have?\n Q. Yes.\n A. I can\u2019t state because it is evidenced presented through other people.\n Q. You can\u2019t state?\n THE COURT: You can answer her question, Ma\u2019am.\n A. Why do I think so because other people have told me and I know the kids\n are broken and I have been told in the past that they are in fear of everything\n going on and they can be coerced. I know they always had plenty of food.\n\nIn January 2024, the Juvenile Court entered its final order in which it terminated\nMother\u2019s parental rights to the Children and Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. The Juvenile\nCourt found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the ground of severe child abuse had\nbeen proven against both Mother and Father. The Juvenile Court also found that clear and\nconvincing evidence supported termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as\nbeing in the Children\u2019s best interest. The Juvenile Court specifically found Kenna to be a\ncredible witness. The Juvenile Court also credited the testimony of witnesses Hawryluk,\nGreer, Crosby, Larissa J., Cole, Floyd, Burke, and Smith. By contrast, the Juvenile Court\nspecifically found the testimony of Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., in which she blamed\nKenna for the family\u2019s situation, not credible. In its detailed Memorandum Opinion\nincorporated into its termination order, the Juvenile Court found, in relevant part:\n\nOn May 17, 2021, Kenna was 16 years old, and had been living . . .\n with her father, two other adults, and three younger children. When law\n enforcement discovered Kenna under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed they knew\n immediately from her appearance and condition that she needed medical\n attention. Kenna looked emaciated, as if she was \u201cstarving to death.\u201d She\n had bruising on her face and head, and she had a bizarre haircut.\n Kenna was transported by ambulance to Hawkins County Memorial\n Hospital, and then to Johnson City Medical Center, where law enforcement\u2019s\n observations were confirmed. When Kenna arrived at JCMC she appeared\n visibly dirty, malnourished and bruised. Her appearance was described by\n Dr. Wilt as \u201cwasted or cachectic.\u201d Her ribs were visible, and her hips and\n spine were protruding. In addition to the bruising on her face and head, she\n had bruising down her back and on her shoulder blades. Upon admission,\n Kenna was approximately 5\u2019 6\u201d tall, and weighed 83 pounds. Kenna was\n diagnosed as being severely malnourished due to caloric restriction by the\n -7-\n\fcaregivers in her home. Her malnourishment was so severe that her life was\nat risk from refeeding syndrome. Even in the face of Kenna\u2019s wasted\nappearance, and her obvious need for immediate medical care, Respondents\ncould not recall the last time she had seen a doctor and did not seek medical\nhelp.\n Kenna has also consistently recounted her physical and emotional\nabuse at the hands of Respondents: from being beaten by [Mother]; to being\nthreatened with a hand gun by [Father]; to having her sense of femininity\nsheared away by [Aaron P.]. It is evident to the Court that all three\nrespondents actively participated in her systematic starvation, and in her\nextreme isolation. This evidence was uncontested at trial, and the Court finds\nby a preponderance of the evidence that Kenna suffered from abuse and\nneglect.\n\n***\n\nKenna suffered no burns at the hands of Respondents. No evidence\nwas presented at trial that Kenna suffered any broken bones, or a concussion.\nThe Court does find, however, that being struck in the head by [Mother] with\nher fists and a broom was likely to cause a broken nose or concussion. No\nevidence was introduced that the child suffered subdural bleeding, cerebral\nedema, or a brain contusion. Upon her admission to JCMC, Kenna did have\na subconjunctival hemorrhage. Kenna did have deeply disturbing bruising\non her face and head, and along her spinal column and across her shoulders.\nWhile Kenna was defeminized by her forced haircut, it did not result in\npermanent or protracted disfigurement. Kenna did report that [Mother] had\nhit her with a broom, a bowl, and a belt. Still, Kenna\u2019s wasted condition does\nnot quite fit squarely within any of the abhorrent injuries specifically detailed\nin the statutory definition. The Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d\nelement, however, does not end there.\n While the statutory definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d includes\nspecific examples, it is \u201cnot limited to\u201d those listed examples. Our Supreme\nCourt has held that the words \u201cincludes, but not limited to\u201d are terms of\nenlargement, not terms of restriction. See Lovlace v Copley, 418 S.W.3d 1,\n18 (Tenn. 2013). This language allows a court to employ its aforementioned\ncommon sense to determine whether an injury suffered by a child can\nreasonably be defined as a serious bodily injury. As such, the Court finds\nthat any reasonable person would conclude that a child who is so severely\nmalnourished that she requires hospitalization and medically monitored\nnourishment, has sustained a serious bodily injury. Accordingly, the Court\n\n-8-\n\ffinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the abuse and neglect suffered\nby Kenna was likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n Likewise, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nabuse and neglect suffered by Kenna was likely to cause death. Kenna\u2019s\nmalnourishment was so severe that she exhibited signs of refeeding\nsyndrome, which poses a severe risk of death. Dr. Wilt testified\nunequivocally that Kenna\u2019s severe malnourishment was likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nPerhaps the most damning evidence of Respondents\u2019 knowing\nexposure of Kenna to severe abuse is the fact that they tried to hide her from\nthe authorities. When a Sheriff\u2019s deputy first responded to the residence for\na welfare check, [Aaron P.] told Kenna to hide under his bed, and told law\nenforcement she was not there. When authorities returned to the residence,\nKenna was again told to hide under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed, and [Mother] and\n[Father] lied about Kenna\u2019s whereabouts. Respondents\u2019 actions clearly\nbetray a consciousness of guilt. They knew that Kenna\u2019s discovery by\nauthorities would reveal the abuse they had inflicted on her. The Court,\ntherefore, finds by clear and convincing evidence that [Father], [Mother], and\n[Aaron P.] each knowingly exposed Kenna to abuse or neglect likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n Furthermore, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n[Father] and [Mother] used force on Kenna likely to cause serious bodily\ninjury or death. As discussed above, [Mother] used her hands and objects,\nsuch as a broom, to strike Kenna in the face and head. This force was likely\nto cause a broken bone or concussion. Additionally, the uncontradicted\nevidence at trial was that [Father] twice threatened Kenna with a gun; on one\noccasion pointing a loaded gun at her forehead and stating, \u201cI want to shoot\nyou.\u201d There is no doubt in the Court\u2019s mind that this behavior constitutes a\nuse of force likely to result in serious bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nThe Court, having addressed the underlying facts and elements of the\nstatutory ground of severe child abuse, must now address the ground itself.\n\u201cOnce these specific underlying facts are established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, the court must step back to look at the combined weight of all\nof those facts, to see if they clearly and convincingly show severe child\nabuse.\u201d Id. at 457 quoting In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 591-592 (Tenn. App.\n\n-9-\n\f2012). The Court finds that the Department has proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] have\ncommitted severe child abuse as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102.\n\n***\n\n[Best Interest]\n\n(A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the\nchild\u2019s critical need for stability and continuity of placement throughout\nthe child\u2019s minority. None of the children are currently in an adoptive\nplacement. The children have also been removed from Respondents\u2019 custody\nfor more than two and a half years. Respondents\u2019 therapeutic visitation has\nnever been increased. In fact, [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was\nsuspended at the time of trial. There has never been a trial home placement,\nor even unsupervised visitation. Considering that Respondents\u2019 case for a\nreturn of custody has not advanced at all in more than two and a half years,\nthe instant termination of their parental rights will free the children for\nadoption and perhaps facilitate a pre-adoptive placement. This factor weighs\nin favor of the termination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is\nlikely to have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical\ncondition. A return of Jasmine and Annabelle to the custody of [Mother]\nand/or [Aaron P.] would have a negative effect on their emotional and\npsychological condition. Both girls were present in the home when Kenna\nwas being severely abused. Jasmine witnessed her mother pulling Kenna\u2019s\nhair, and Kenna screaming. She witnessed her mother yelling at Kenna to sit\ncorrectly. Annabelle also witnessed the severe abuse of Kenna. She\ndescribed scary events, and recounted her own maltreatment. At the prospect\nof a visit with her parents, Jasmine threatened to hurt herself and her mother,\nresulting in her admission to Woodridge Psychiatric Hospital. Annabelle did\nnot want to visit with her parents, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic\nstress disorder. All of these facts were uncontradicted by [Mother] and\n[Aaron P.] at trial. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the termination\nof [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n There was no evidence presented at trial regarding Liam\u2019s emotional,\npsychological, or medical condition, likely due to his young age. The Court\nis unable to make a factual finding regarding what effect a change of\ncaretakers would have on Liam. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\nagainst the termination of [Father\u2019s] or [Mother\u2019s] parental rights to Liam.\n\n-10-\n\f (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability\nin meeting the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety\nneeds. Respondents have not had a meaningful opportunity to meet these\nneeds in more than two and a half years. Of course, the children\u2019s removal\nwas the result of Respondents\u2019 own actions. The evidence is undisputed that\nat the time of their removal, the children subject to this petition appeared\nwell. They did not appear malnourished; they were not bruised like Kenna.\nThe evidence is also undisputed that prior to their removal they were\nallegedly being home schooled with a curriculum not accredited in\nTennessee, and that they were educationally behind. It is equally undisputed\nthat when in Respondents\u2019 custody, the children lived in a home of casual\nviolence and abuse. A home in which adults assault, threaten and abuse one\nchild does not meet the safety needs of any child. This factor weighs in favor\nof termination of all Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy\nparental attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable\nexpectation that the parent can create such attachment. As already\ndiscussed, the evidence presented at trial clearly establishes that neither\n[Mother] nor [Aaron P.] have a secure and healthy parental attachment with\nJasmine or Annabelle. Moreover, neither [Mother] nor [Aaron P.] testified\nregarding their attachment with, or love for, their children, or how they\nexpect to recreate that relationship. There was simply no evidence\nintroduced at trial that would allow the Court to conclude that there is a\nreasonable expectation that [Mother] or [Aaron P.] can create a healthy\nparental attachment with Annabelle or Jasmine. The undisputed evidence\nsuggests the opposite.\n At the time of trial, Liam was nearly four years old. He has been\nremoved from his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s custody for significantly more than\nhalf his young life. Again, neither [Father] nor [Mother] elected to testify\nregarding their parental attachment with or love for Liam, or how they hope\nto create such attachment. This factor weighs in favor of the termination of\nall Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other\ncontact with the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate\na positive relationship with the child. The evidence at trial establishes that,\nwhen available, Respondents regularly attended therapeutic visitation with\nthe children, and that Respondents behavior during the visits was largely\nappropriate. [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was suspended in 2023,\nthough the suspension does not appear to have resulted from their behavior\nat the visit. As of trial, [Father] was still attending visits with Liam.\n\n-11-\n\f With regard to [Mother] and [Aaron P.], this factor weighs neither in\nfavor of nor against termination. With regard to [Father], this factor weighs\nagainst termination.\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home. The\nevidence presented at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and\nAnnabelle are fearful of their parents. Jasmine was so fearful of a visit that\nshe credibly threated [sic] to hurt herself and her mother, requiring her\nadmission to a psychiatric hospital. Annabelle has consistently maintained\nthat she does not want to see her parents, and she has been diagnosed with\npost-traumatic stress disorder. While [Father] is not the father of Jasmine or\nAnnabelle, the Court has no doubt their fear also extends to him. There was\nno evidence introduced at trial that Liam was in fear of his parents.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s\nhousehold trigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or\npost-traumatic symptoms. Much as in the previous factor, the evidence\nintroduced at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and Annabelle are\nterrified of all Respondents. There is simply no question that Respondents\ntrigger and exacerbate the girls\u2019 experience of trauma and post-traumatic\nsymptoms. The Court does not have to speculate, as there is undisputed\nevidence of this actually happening. Again, there was no evidence presented\nat trial that would allow the Court to make this same conclusion with regard\nto Liam.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment\nwith another person or persons in the absence of the parent. The children\nare not in a pre-adoptive home. There was no evidence introduced at trial\nthat the children had developed a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson who is still involved in their care in the absence of the parent. The\nchildren had become attached with their initial foster parent who had hoped\nto adopt them, but due to the development of a serious illness was no longer\nable to care for them. Still, the children do not have a healthy attachment\nwith Respondents. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor against\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n\n-12-\n\f (I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships\nwith persons other than parents and caregivers, including biological or\nfoster siblings, and the likely impact of various available outcomes on\nthese relationships and the child\u2019s access to information about the\nchild\u2019s heritage. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle have been placed together\nsince their removal from Respondents more than two and a half years ago.\nThere is direct evidence that Jasmine and Annabelle rely on their relationship\nfor comfort and safety. Their school counsellor, Mr. Floyd, testified that the\nchildren would want to meet with him together. Annabelle scolds her CAC\ninterviewer that she and Jasmine could have been interviewed together. It is\nevident to the Court that this sibling relationship is paramount, and is\nessential to the best interest of all three children. Indeed, their relationship\nwith each other has been the only constant in their lives. This factor weighs\nheavily in favor of the Court\u2019s decision being uniform for all three children.\n (J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and\nbeneficial for the child to be in the home of the parent, including\nconsideration of whether there is criminal activity in the home or by the\nparent, or the use of alcohol, controlled substances, or controlled\nsubstance analogues which may render the parent unable to consistently\ncare for the child in a safe and stable manner. No evidence was presented\nthat Respondents had issues with substance abuse. There was testimony that\nRespondents had largely completed the actions steps set forth for them by\nthe Department. There was some dispute as to whether Respondents had\ncompleted a mental health assessment. Of course, Respondents could have\naddressed this question had they elected to testify. They could have also\nintroduced confirming documentation. They did neither. More importantly,\nRespondents did not testify that they had made a lasting adjustment regarding\ntheir abusive conduct, or even deny that such conduct ever happened. There\nis simply no evidence that allows the Court to conclude, in the face of\nundisputed evidence that Respondents severely abused Kenna, that the\nchildren would be safe in their parents\u2019 home. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available\nprograms, services, or community resources to assist in making a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions. The Court\u2019s\nassessment of this factor mirrors that of factor (J). While Respondents\nlargely completed the action steps set forth by the Department, no\ndocumentary evidence was submitted as an exhibit, and there was no\ntestimony that Respondents have made a lasting adjustment to their abusive\nconduct which resulted in the removal of the children from their custody.\n -13-\n\fThe undisputed testimony at trial was that Respondents refused to accept\nresponsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondent\u2019s parental rights.\n (L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist\nthe parent in making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in\nthe custody of the department. The Court cannot conclude from the\nevidence presented at trial that the Department made reasonable efforts to\nassist Respondents in making a lasting adjustment that would allow the return\nof the children. This factor weighs against termination of Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nestablishing paternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or\naddressing the circumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award\nof custody unsafe and not in the child\u2019s best interest. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nregaining custody of the children, or in addressing the undisputed abuse of\nKenna which led to the removal of the children in the first place.\nRespondents did not testify regarding any steps they had taken to regain\ncustody of the children. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\nRespondents refused to accept responsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This\nfactor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or\nfrequenting the home of the parent, has shown brutality or physical,\nsexual, emotional, or psychological abuse or neglect toward the child or\nany other child or adult. This Court has found by clear and convincing\nevidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] severely abused\nKenna. This factor weighs heavily in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for\nthe child or any other child. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle resided in a\nhome in which Respondents were severely abusing another child. Jasmine\nand Annabelle were twice removed from the custody of [Mother] and [Aaron\nP.] before their current removal. The Court simply cannot find that the\nchildren were ever provided safe and stable care by Respondents. This factor\nweighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the child to thrive. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the children to thrive. The undisputed\nevidence is that Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was\n\n-14-\n\f occurring, which has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n This factor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s\n basic and specific needs and in which the child can thrive. No evidence\n was presented at trial that Respondents demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating a home that meets the children\u2019s basic and specific\n needs and in which the children can thrive. The undisputed evidence is that\n Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was occurring, which\n has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs\n in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is\n healthy and safe for the child. There was no testimony or other evidence\n introduced at trial regarding the physical environment of any of\n Respondents\u2019 current homes. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\n against termination.\n (S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token\n financial support for the child. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\n Respondents paid their child support. The amount of support was not\n identified. This factor weighs against termination.\n (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would\n be detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n The Court has found by clear and convincing evidence that each of [Father],\n [Mother], and [Aaron P.] committed severe child abuse against Kenna. The\n undisputed evidence supports this finding. Respondents did not deny the\n abuse; they did not accept responsibility for their conduct. They did not\n address how things have changed. They did not address the trauma suffered\n by Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs heavily in favor of\n terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n This Court acknowledges, and truly believes, that not all parental\n misconduct is irredeemable. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 877 (Tenn.\n App. 2005). But knowing full well what is at stake, Respondents declined to\n dispute the overwhelming evidence that they severely abused a child;\n declined to accept any responsibility for Kenna\u2019s wasted condition and the\n trauma suffered by Annabelle and Jasmine; and declined to tell the Court\n what steps they have taken to redeem themselves. This Court has no choice\n but to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that the termination of\n Respondents\u2019 parental rights is in the best interest of the children.\n\n(Footnote omitted). Mother and Father timely appealed to this Court.\n -15-\n\f Discussion\n\nWe restate and consolidate Mother\u2019s issues into the following dispositive issues: 1)\nwhether the Juvenile Court erred in finding the ground of severe child abuse against Mother\nand 2) whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of Mother\u2019s parental\nrights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. Father does not challenge the ground for\ntermination found against him but raises an issue as to Liam\u2019s best interest.\n\nAs our Supreme Court has instructed regarding the standard of review in parental\nrights termination cases:\n\nA parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of her child is among the\n oldest of the judicially recognized fundamental liberty interests protected by\n the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.5 Troxel v.\n Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); Stanley\n v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); In re\n Angela E., 303 S.W.3d 240, 250 (Tenn. 2010); In re Adoption of Female\n Child, 896 S.W.2d 546, 547-48 (Tenn. 1995); Hawk v. Hawk, 855 S.W.2d\n 573, 578-79 (Tenn. 1993). But parental rights, although fundamental and\n constitutionally protected, are not absolute. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 250. \u201c\u2018[T]he [S]tate as parens patriae has a special duty to protect minors .\n . . .\u2019 Tennessee law, thus, upholds the [S]tate\u2019s authority as parens patriae\n when interference with parenting is necessary to prevent serious harm to a\n child.\u201d Hawk, 855 S.W.2d at 580 (quoting In re Hamilton, 657 S.W.2d 425,\n 429 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983)); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747,\n 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 250.\n \u201cWhen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks\n not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388. \u201cFew consequences of judicial\n action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u201d Id. at 787, 102\n S.Ct. 1388; see also M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136\n L.Ed.2d 473 (1996). The parental rights at stake are \u201cfar more precious than\n any property right.\u201d Santosky, 455 U.S. at 758-59, 102 S.Ct. 1388.\n Termination of parental rights has the legal effect of reducing the parent to\n the role of a complete stranger and of \u201csevering forever all legal rights and\n U.S. Const. amend. XIV \u00a7 1 (\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without\ndue process of law . . . .\u201d). Similarly, article 1, section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution states \u201c[t]hat no\nman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled,\nor in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers or\nthe law of the land.\u201d\n -16-\n\f obligations of the parent or guardian of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-\n 113(l)(1); see also Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388 (recognizing\n that a decision terminating parental rights is \u201cfinal and irrevocable\u201d). In light\n of the interests and consequences at stake, parents are constitutionally\n entitled to \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d in termination proceedings.\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 754, 102 S.Ct. 1388; see also Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc.\n Servs. of Durham Cnty., N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d\n 640 (1981) (discussing the due process right of parents to fundamentally fair\n procedures).\n\nAmong the constitutionally mandated \u201cfundamentally fair\n procedures\u201d is a heightened standard of proof \u2013 clear and convincing\n evidence. Santosky, 455 U.S. at 769, 102 S.Ct. 1388. This standard\n minimizes the risk of unnecessary or erroneous governmental interference\n with fundamental parental rights. Id.; In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d 586, 596\n (Tenn. 2010). \u201cClear and convincing evidence enables the fact-finder to\n form a firm belief or conviction regarding the truth of the facts, and\n eliminates any serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of these\n factual findings.\u201d In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596 (citations omitted).\n The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard ensures that the facts are\n established as highly probable, rather than as simply more probable than not.\n In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 861 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); In re M.A.R.,\n 183 S.W.3d 652, 660 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).\n\nTennessee statutes governing parental termination proceedings\n incorporate this constitutionally mandated standard of proof. Tennessee\n Code Annotated section 36-1-113(c) provides:\n\nTermination of parental or guardianship rights must be based\n upon:\n\n(1) A finding by the court by clear and convincing evidence that\n the grounds for termination of parental or guardianship rights\n have been established; and\n (2) That termination of the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s rights is in the\n best interests of the child.\n\nThis statute requires the State to establish by clear and convincing proof that\n at least one of the enumerated statutory grounds6 for termination exists and\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(1)-(13).\n -17-\n\f that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d\n at 250; In re F.R.R., III, 193 S.W.3d 528, 530 (Tenn. 2006); In re Valentine,\n 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). \u201cThe best interests analysis is separate\n from and subsequent to the determination that there is clear and convincing\n evidence of grounds for termination.\u201d In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 254.\n Although several factors relevant to the best interests analysis are statutorily\n enumerated,7 the list is illustrative, not exclusive. The parties are free to offer\n proof of other relevant factors. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 878. The trial\n court must then determine whether the combined weight of the facts\n \u201camount[s] to clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the child\u2019s\n best interest.\u201d In re Kaliyah S., 455 S.W.3d 533, 555 (Tenn. 2015). These\n requirements ensure that each parent receives the constitutionally required\n \u201cindividualized determination that a parent is either unfit or will cause\n substantial harm to his or her child before the fundamental right to the care\n and custody of the child can be taken away.\u201d In re Swanson, 2 S.W.3d 180,\n 188 (Tenn. 1999).\n\nFurthermore, other statutes impose certain requirements upon trial\n courts hearing termination petitions. A trial court must \u201censure that the\n hearing on the petition takes place within six (6) months of the date that the\n petition is filed, unless the court determines an extension is in the best\n interests of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(k). A trial court must\n \u201center an order that makes specific findings of fact and conclusions of law\n within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d Id. This portion of\n the statute requires a trial court to make \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of\n law as to whether clear and convincing evidence establishes the existence of\n each of the grounds asserted for terminating [parental] rights.\u201d In re Angela\n E., 303 S.W.3d at 255. \u201cShould the trial court conclude that clear and\n convincing evidence of ground(s) for termination does exist, then the trial\n court must also make a written finding whether clear and convincing\n evidence establishes that termination of [parental] rights is in the [child\u2019s]\n best interests.\u201d Id. If the trial court\u2019s best interests analysis \u201cis based on\n additional factual findings besides the ones made in conjunction with the\n grounds for termination, the trial court must also include these findings in the\n written order.\u201d Id. Appellate courts \u201cmay not conduct de novo review of the\n termination decision in the absence of such findings.\u201d Id. (citing Adoption\n Place, Inc. v. Doe, 273 S.W.3d 142, 151 & n. 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)).\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i).\n -18-\n\f B. Standards of Appellate Review\n\nAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in\n termination proceedings using the standard of review in Tenn. R. App. P.\n 13(d). In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 246. Under Rule 13(d), appellate courts review factual findings de novo on\n the record and accord these findings a presumption of correctness unless the\n evidence preponderates otherwise. In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In\n re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d 387, 393 (Tenn. 2009); In re Adoption of A.M.H., 215\n S.W.3d 793, 809 (Tenn. 2007). In light of the heightened burden of proof in\n termination proceedings, however, the reviewing court must make its own\n determination as to whether the facts, either as found by the trial court or as\n supported by a preponderance of the evidence, amount to clear and\n convincing evidence of the elements necessary to terminate parental rights.\n In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596-97. The trial court\u2019s ruling that the\n evidence sufficiently supports termination of parental rights is a conclusion\n of law, which appellate courts review de novo with no presumption of\n correctness. In re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d at 393 (quoting In re Adoption of\n A.M.H., 215 S.W.3d at 810). Additionally, all other questions of law in\n parental termination appeals, as in other appeals, are reviewed de novo with\n no presumption of correctness. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 246.\n\nIn re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507, 521-24 (Tenn. 2016) (footnotes in original but\nrenumbered). In conjunction with a best interest determination, clear and convincing\nevidence supporting any single ground will justify a termination order. E.g., In re\nValentine, 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). Although Father does not challenge the\nground for termination found against him, we must review it anyway. In re Carrington H.,\n483 S.W.3d at 511 (\u201c[A]ppellate courts must review a trial court\u2019s findings regarding all\ngrounds for termination and whether termination is in a child\u2019s best interests, even if a\nparent fails to challenge these findings on appeal.\u201d).\n\nWe first address Mother\u2019s issues, beginning with whether the Juvenile Court erred\nin finding the ground of severe child abuse against her. On May 25, 2022, when DCS filed\nits petition, the ground of severe child abuse read as follows:\n\n(g) Initiation of termination of parental or guardianship rights may be based\n upon any of the grounds listed in this subsection (g). The following grounds\n are cumulative and nonexclusive, so that listing conditions, acts or omissions\n in one ground does not prevent them from coming within another ground:\n\n***\n -19-\n\f (4) The parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child\n abuse, as defined in \u00a7 37-1-102, under any prior order of a court or is found\n by the court hearing the petition to terminate parental rights or the petition\n for adoption to have committed severe child abuse against any child[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nAs relevant, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102 provides:\n\n(27) \u201cSevere child abuse\u201d means:\n (A)(i) The knowing exposure of a child to or the knowing failure to protect\n a child from abuse or neglect that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or\n death and the knowing use of force on a child that is likely to cause serious\n bodily injury or death;\n (ii) \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d shall have the same meaning given in \u00a7 39-15-\n 402(c)[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102(b)(27)(A) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022). Regarding\nwhat \u201cknowing\u201d conduct consists of in the context of severe child abuse, our Supreme\nCourt has held:\n\n[F]or severe child abuse, a person\u2019s conduct is considered \u201cknowing,\u201d and a\n person is deemed to \u201cknowingly\u201d act or fail to act, when he actually knows\n of relevant facts, circumstances or information, or when he is either in\n deliberate ignorance of or in reckless disregard of such facts, circumstances,\n or information presented to him. Under this standard, the relevant facts,\n circumstances, or information would alert a reasonable parent to take\n affirmative action to protect the child. For deliberate ignorance, a parent can\n be found to have acted knowingly when he has specific reason to know the\n relevant facts, circumstances, or information but deliberately ignores them.\n For reckless disregard, if the parent has been presented with the relevant\n facts, circumstances, or information and recklessly disregards them, the\n parent\u2019s failure to protect can be considered knowing.\n\nIn re Markus E., 671 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Tenn. 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402 provides, as relevant:\n\n(c) \u201cSerious bodily injury to the child\u201d includes, but is not limited to, second-\n or third-degree burns, a fracture of any bone, a concussion, subdural or\n -20-\n\f subarachnoid bleeding, retinal hemorrhage, cerebral edema, brain contusion,\n injuries to the skin that involve severe bruising or the likelihood of permanent\n or protracted disfigurement, including those sustained by whipping children\n with objects and acts of female genital mutilation as defined in \u00a7 39-13-110.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402(c) (West eff. July 1, 2019).\n\nMother challenges the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings that she committed severe child\nabuse. She asserts that, while the Juvenile Court focused on Kenna\u2019s risk for \u201crefeeding\nsyndrome,\u201d refeeding syndrome was not an abusive act by Mother but simply a result of\nincreasing caloric intake to a malnourished person. Mother argues further that there was\nno basis for the Juvenile Court\u2019s finding that Mother\u2019s striking Kenna with her fists or a\nbroom were likely to cause a broken nose or a concussion.\n\nThe Juvenile Court made detailed factual findings regarding Mother\u2019s abusive acts\ntoward Kenna. The evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s factual\nfindings. Furthermore, the Juvenile Court credited Kenna\u2019s testimony, including her\naccount of suffering at Mother\u2019s hands. We defer to a trial court\u2019s credibility determination\nabsent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Kelly v. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 692\n(Tenn. 2014). This record contains no clear and convincing evidence that would serve to\noverturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s credibility determinations regarding Kenna or any of the\nother witnesses.\n\nThe record reveals that Mother brutally abused Kenna by starving and beating her.\nMother\u2019s emphasis on refeeding syndrome misses the forest for the trees. Had Mother not\nstarved Kenna in the first place, Kenna would not have been at risk for refeeding syndrome.\nMother\u2019s abusive acts led to Kenna becoming gravely malnourished. This Court has\npreviously recognized malnourishment as a basis for sustaining the ground of severe child\nabuse. See In re Keara J., 376 S.W.3d 86, 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2012) (\u201c[W]e conclude that\nthe evidence overwhelmingly establishes Keara as a severely abused child who was\nsuffering the effects of knowing nutritional and physical neglect in her parents\u2019 care.\u201d).\nHere, Mother purposefully deprived Kenna of sufficient food, leading to Kenna becoming\nseverely emaciated. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s condition was such that she faced likely\nstarvation or death, had it continued. Had it not been for the intervention of law\nenforcement, Kenna might well have died of starvation thanks to Mother. Mother\u2019s\nstarvation of Kenna constituted severe child abuse under any definition of the term.\n\nMother also takes issue with the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings regarding her beatings of\nKenna. The Juvenile Court found that, while Kenna had not suffered any broken bones or\na concussion, \u201cbeing struck in the head by [Mother] with her fists and a broom was likely\nto cause a broken nose or concussion.\u201d Mother contends that this finding has no basis. We\n -21-\n\fdisagree. The Juvenile Court\u2019s findings reflect the common sense understanding that an\nadult repeatedly striking a child in the face with fists and/or various hard objects is likely\nto cause that child to have a broken nose or concussion. Mother\u2019s actions toward Kenna\nwent far beyond any legitimate discipline and fell squarely into the statutory definition of\nacts likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n\nAs a final point on this issue, Mother argues strenuously that since Kenna was not\nher child, she should not be held to the duties of a parent or guardian. Mother\u2019s argument\nis without merit. The ground for parental rights at issue, (g)(4), provides for termination\nwhen \u201c[t]he parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child abuse . . .\nagainst any child[.]\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30,\n2022) (emphasis added). Thus, it does not matter that Kenna was not Mother\u2019s child. The\nGeneral Assembly has decided that inflicting severe abuse on any child, not only one\u2019s\nbiological or legal child, will sustain the ground of severe child abuse. We find, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that the ground of severe child abuse was proven against Mother by clear\nand convincing evidence.\n\nWe next address whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. On May 25, 2022, when DCS\nfiled its petition, the best interest factors read as follows:\n\n(i)(1) In determining whether termination of parental or guardianship rights\n is in the best interest of the child, the court shall consider all relevant and\n child-centered factors applicable to the particular case before the court.\n Those factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n (A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the child\u2019s critical\n need for stability and continuity of placement throughout the child\u2019s\n minority;\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to\n have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical condition;\n (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability in meeting\n the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety needs;\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy parental\n attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable expectation that the\n parent can create such attachment;\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with\n the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate a positive\n relationship with the child;\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home;\n\n-22-\n\f(G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s household\ntrigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or post-traumatic\nsymptoms;\n(H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson or persons in the absence of the parent;\n(I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships with persons\nother than parents and caregivers, including biological or foster siblings, and\nthe likely impact of various available outcomes on these relationships and\nthe child\u2019s access to information about the child\u2019s heritage;\n(J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and beneficial for the\nchild to be in the home of the parent, including consideration of whether there\nis criminal activity in the home or by the parent, or the use of alcohol,\ncontrolled substances, or controlled substance analogues which may render\nthe parent unable to consistently care for the child in a safe and stable\nmanner;\n(K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available programs, services,\nor community resources to assist in making a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions;\n(L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent\nin making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in the custody of\nthe department;\n(M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in establishing\npaternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or addressing the\ncircumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award of custody unsafe\nand not in the child\u2019s best interest;\n(N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or frequenting the\nhome of the parent, has shown brutality or physical, sexual, emotional, or\npsychological abuse or neglect toward the child or any other child or adult;\n(O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for the child\nor any other child;\n(P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the basic and\nspecific needs required for the child to thrive;\n(Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and commitment to\ncreating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s basic and specific\nneeds and in which the child can thrive;\n(R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is healthy and\nsafe for the child;\n(S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token financial\nsupport for the child; and\n\n-23-\n\f (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would be\n detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n (2) When considering the factors set forth in subdivision (i)(1), the prompt\n and permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is presumed to\n be in the child\u2019s best interest.\n (3) All factors considered by the court to be applicable to a particular case\n must be identified and supported by specific findings of fact in the court\u2019s\n written order.\n (4) Expert testimony is not required to prove or disprove any factor by any\n party.\n (5) As used in this subsection (i), \u201cparent\u201d includes guardian.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nMother argues that the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest analysis. According\nto Mother, she \u201chas not had a meaningful opportunity to meet the needs of her children in\nmore than two and a half years\u201d because DCS took the Children from her. Mother says it\nwas wrong for the Juvenile Court to hold this separation against her because it presumes\nthat she did what she was accused of doing. Mother also points out that, despite Kenna\u2019s\ncondition, the Children appeared to have been properly fed and were not bruised. In\nessence, Mother argues that, regardless of what she may have done to Kenna, the Children\nwere fine in her care. Mother also says that the Juvenile Court wrongly held her decision\nnot to testify against her.\n\nImplicit to Mother\u2019s argument is that she merely is alleged to have abused Kenna.\nHowever, a bench trial has been held in this matter. The Juvenile Court found that Mother\ncommitted severe child abuse against Kenna based upon its findings that Mother starved\nand beat Kenna. We have found nothing in the record to overturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s\nfactual findings. On the contrary, the record fully supports the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings.\nMother\u2019s abuse of Kenna no longer is a mere allegation\u2014it is an adjudicated fact. It was\nMother\u2019s abusive actions that led to the Children\u2019s removal and her separation from them.\nMother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take responsibility for it, is the\nweightiest factor in this matter. Regarding Mother\u2019s argument that the Children appeared\nnormal despite Kenna\u2019s condition, that is both insufficient and misleading. The Children\nwere in the same household where Mother\u2019s brutality and violence against Kenna unfolded.\nAnnabelle and Jasmine required therapy and fell behind educationally. While the Children\nmay not have been subjected to the same horrors that Mother inflicted on Kenna, they were\nnevertheless exposed to a climate of abuse and fear. Thus, it is inaccurate to suggest that\nthe Children somehow led normal lives notwithstanding what Mother did to Kenna. It was\nappropriate for the Juvenile Court to consider Mother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna in\n -24-\n\fconcluding that the Children were at risk of facing similar abuse should they be returned\nto Mother\u2019s care. There is no hint that Mother understands the severity of what she did to\nKenna or even that what she did to Kenna was wrong. Finally, regarding Mother\u2019s\nassertion that the Juvenile Court held her refusal to testify against her, we find that not to\nbe the case. The Juvenile Court did not punish Mother for declining to testify. It merely\nnoted that Mother could have shed more light on certain factors had she chosen to testify.\nThat was a correct observation by the Juvenile Court. Mother chose not to testify, and the\nJuvenile Court was by necessity limited to the evidence adduced from other sources. In\nsum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as to each applicable best interest factor.\nThe evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We\nfind by clear and convincing evidence, as did the Juvenile Court, that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. We affirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s\njudgment terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights to the Children.\n\nWe next address Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. Father does not contest the ground\nof severe child abuse found against him. All the same, under our Supreme Court\u2019s holding\nin In re Carrington H., we are required to address it. The Juvenile Court made detailed\nfindings regarding Father\u2019s role in the severe abuse suffered by Kenna. Father stood by\nwhile his daughter was starved and suffered beatings at Mother\u2019s hands. Father even\npointed a gun at Kenna on occasion. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground of\nsevere child abuse was proven against Father by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThe final issue we address is whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that\ntermination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. On this issue, Father\nmakes several contentions as to why he believes the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest\nanalysis. Father states that he has appropriate housing; that he is employed; that he\ncompleted a parenting assessment; that he completed an alcohol and drug program; that his\nvisits with Liam were appropriate; that he has completed the tasks required of him; and\nthat Liam liked seeing him on visits. According to Father, the Juvenile Court did not give\nenough weight to these positives in its analysis.\n\nFather is correct in that he did certain positive things during the custodial period.\nThe Juvenile Court recognized as much in its order. For example, the Juvenile Court found\nthat the factor concerning visitation weighed against terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to\nLiam. The record reflects that Liam was happy to see Father on visits. By the same\nmeasure, however, the record reflects that Liam is happy in general. In any event, the\nJuvenile Court did not utterly discount Father\u2019s positive acts. Even still, hinging upon \u201cthe\ncircumstances of a particular child and a particular parent, the consideration of one factor\nmay very well dictate the outcome of the analysis.\u201d In re Gabriella D., 531 S.W.3d 662,\n682 (Tenn. 2017) (quoting In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 878 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).\n -25-\n\fUnder the circumstances of this case, severe child abuse is the paramount concern. Father\nstood by while his daughter Kenna was starved and beaten by Mother. Father even\ncontributed to the abuse by pointing a gun at Kenna on occasion. There is no hint that\nFather has ever taken responsibility for the brutality Kenna endured. Instead, Father\nblamed Kenna. Father\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take\nresponsibility for it, outweighs his positive actions and poses the real risk that Liam could\nsuffer similar abuse in Father\u2019s care. In sum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as\nto each applicable best interest factor. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find by clear and convincing evidence, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that termination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. We\naffirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe judgment of the Juvenile Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the\nJuvenile Court for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed 50% to\nthe Appellant, Rikiya P., and 50% to the Appellant, Daniel R., and their surety, if any.\n\n____________________________________\n D.

The circuit court found that it was timely accepted and that a\n\nbinding settlement agreement was formed. Over the wife\u2019s objection, the court entered a\n\njudgment for absolute divorce based on mutual consent. The court incorporated (but did\n\nnot merge) the settlement agreement into the judgment. The Appellate Court of Maryland\n\ndisagreed and reversed the judgment of the circuit court. We affirm the judgment of the\n\nAppellate Court.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nThis contested divorce case was commenced by Petitioner Todd Pattison\n\n(\u201cHusband\u201d) on May 24, 2019, when he filed a complaint for an absolute divorce against\n\nRespondent Deborah Pattison (\u201cWife\u201d), who filed a counterclaim the following month. The\n\nparties alleged various grounds for divorce, none of which are relevant here.\n\nTrial was scheduled to begin on October 5, 2020. On September 16, 2020, over\n\nWife\u2019s objection, the court postponed the trial until March 2021. Two days later, the parties\n\nattended a pretrial/settlement conference at which they spent approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a retired judge. No settlement was reached.\n\nOn Friday, September 25, 2020, Wife\u2019s counsel sent a hand-delivered settlement\n\npackage to Husband\u2019s counsel containing a Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement\n\nAgreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), bearing Wife\u2019s signature. Among other terms, the\n\nAgreement provided that, \u201c[i]n order to balance the equities of the parties in and to their\n\nproperties, Husband shall pay to Wife a monetary award . . . in the amount of $760,000.00\n\fto be paid\u201d in six installments over two and one-half years. To secure this obligation, the\n\nAgreement required Husband to execute a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d), attached as\n\nExhibit A to the Agreement. The Agreement also stated that Husband\u2019s business and living\n\ntrust \u201cshall guarantee payment of this monetary award obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an\n\nunconditional guaranty (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d) was included in the settlement package.\n\nThe cover letter with the proposed Agreement stated:\n\nEnclosed please find two (2) signed, initialed and notarized originals\n of the Pattison Marital Settlement Agreement for counter-execution by your\n client. A redlined copy of the pages of the Agreement depicting my revisions\n to the version which you sent to me yesterday is also attached; note that non-\n substantive changes were also made at pages 5, 6 and 8 in addition to the\n \u201crepairs\u201d language on pages 3-4. Further note that changes to page 8 were\n made in order to reflect the fact that there is a Note to be paid according to\n its terms and that the Guarantors will not be signing the Note itself.\n\nAlso enclosed is the final version of the Promissory Note (Ex. A) and\n the form of the Guaranty which has been approved by [Wife].\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nHusband received the settlement package by email that same day, but signed the\n\ndocuments the following Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, Husband filed an amended complaint seeking an absolute\n\ndivorce based on mutual consent. See MD. CODE ANN., FAM. LAW (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 7-103(a)(3)\n\n(2019 Repl. Vol.). Among other things, Husband alleged that he and Wife entered into the\n\fAgreement. He requested that the court incorporate but not merge the Agreement into a\n\njudgment of absolute divorce.\n\nWife timely answered the amended complaint on October 12, 2020, alleging that\n\nHusband failed to timely accept her settlement offer and that, therefore, the Agreement was\n\na nullity.\n\nHusband moved to enforce the settlement agreement on October 16, 2020. The court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on March 16, 2021. Husband and Wife both testified. The\n\ncircuit court granted Husband\u2019s motion. The court recognized that settlement agreements\n\nare contracts, and that mutual assent is an \u201cessential prerequisite to the creation or\n\nformation of a contract.\u201d The court then analyzed the language of the Agreement and\n\nconcluded that its plain terms were definite and reflected the parties\u2019 intent to be bound.\n\nThe court rejected Wife\u2019s argument that her offer was conditioned on Husband\n\nsigning the Agreement on September 25, 2020. The court acknowledged that the cover\n\nletter contained language \u201cindicating\u201d a condition that Husband needed to sign the\n\nAgreement on September 25, 2020, but that Husband \u201cdenie[d]\u201d that the letter imposed a\n\n\u201chard deadline, and point[ed] to language\u201d in the letter \u201cindicating an expectation that the\n\nagreement would be finalized by the following week.\u201d The court weighed the credibility\n\nof the witnesses and concluded that Wife\u2019s offer did not include \u201ca definite time expiration\n\nof September 25th, 2020.\u201d The court stated that even if it did, \u201ccontract formation still\n\nwould have occurred through the action of the parties.\u201d The court did not explain the factual\n\nbasis for that finding, but instead proceeded to find that even if Wife had imposed a hard\n\ndeadline, she waived it.\n\f To that end, the court stated that \u201cthe evidence presented at the hearing indicated\n\nthat counsel was in communication throughout the day and the parties were being updated\n\nby their respective counsel.\u201d The court reasoned:\n\nAt some point on the 25th [Husband] indicated through counsel that\n he would not be able to sign the agreement until Monday.\n There is no evidence presented to indicate that [Wife] rejected\n [Husband]\u2019s offer to sign the agreement on Monday, the 28th, rather than\n Friday. In fact, the evidence indicates a willingness to accept the separation\n [agreement] from [Husband] on Monday.\n As a result, [Husband] signed and returned the separation agreement\n on September 28th, 2020.\n Importantly, the first time the issue of untimeliness was raised by\n [Wife] was when she filed her answer to the amended complaint 17 days\n later. [Wife]\u2019s failure to raise the issue until 17 days after [Husband] accepted\n her offer constitutes a waiver of the requirement to sign the separation\n agreement on the 25th.\n\nCiting section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, 1 the court stated:\n\nan offeror who has imposed a time limit in its offer does not in fact insist\n upon it, and by further negotiations the offeror may indicate a continued\n willingness to stand by the terms of its offer. Any such manifestation of\n continued willingness on the part of the offeror will extend the time during\n which acceptance may occur, constituting in effect a new offer which may\n be accepted, and if so accepted, will ripen into a contract.\n\nSee 1 Samuel Williston & Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 5:5 (4th\n\ned.).\n\nFrom there, the court determined that it was \u201cnot persuaded that [Wife] was\n\nunwilling to extend the time during which acceptance [could] occur after learning that\n The circuit court cited to section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, \u201cLapse by\nexpiration of time stated in offer.\u201d In the May 2025 updated version of Williston on\nContracts, that passage is found in section 5:7.\n\f[Husband] was unable to perform\u201d on September 25. Thus, the court found \u201cthat mutual\n\nconsent of the parties to form a contract, namely the [Agreement], ha[d] occurred.\u201d\n\nB\n\nWife noted an appeal. The Appellate Court of Maryland dismissed her appeal\n\nbecause no final judgment had been entered. Pattison v. Pattison, 254 Md. App. 294\n\n(2022).\n\nOn remand, the court granted Husband an absolute divorce by mutual consent and\n\nincorporated but did not merge the Agreement into the divorce decree.\n\nWife appealed again, and in a reported opinion, the Appellate Court reversed.\n\nPattison v. Pattison, 262 Md. App. 504 (2024). The court found that no contract was\n\nformed because Husband failed to execute the Agreement by the end of the day on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, as required by Wife\u2019s explicitly stated condition. Id. at 529, 534-35.\n\nThe court also found no evidence supporting the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Wife had\n\nwaived this condition. Id. at 534.\n\nWe granted Husband\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. Pattison v. Pattison, 489 Md.\n\n243 (2024).\n\nII\n\nA\n\nHusband contends that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement because Wife signed the document on September 25, 2020, and he signed it on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020. He argues that Wife accepted the terms of the Agreement through her\n\nsignature, and that her condition for same-day execution was not part of the Agreement but\n\fwas rather an extrinsic attempt to change its terms. To that end, Husband argues that the\n\nintegration clause in the Agreement\u2014which states that the document contains the entire\n\nunderstanding of the parties\u2014precludes consideration of the condition in the cover letter.\n\nTo support his position, Husband points to his testimony at the hearing that he did\n\nnot interpret the cover letter as imposing a hard deadline of September 25. Husband\n\ntestified: \u201cMy interpretation was [Wife\u2019s counsel] needed all the executed documents by\n\nMonday, because without the personal guarant[y] and the promissory note the settlement\n\nagreement is unenforceable.\u201d\n\nHusband argues that even if the cover letter imposed an acceptance deadline, it was\n\nan unreasonable condition. According to Husband, that\u2019s because the parties\u2019 attorneys\n\ncommunicated on the morning of September 25, and Wife\u2019s counsel knew that nobody\n\nwould be at Husband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office to accept delivery of the settlement package. He\n\nargues that the email with the settlement package was not received by his counsel until\n\n3:51 p.m., \u201cjust over an hour from the close of the business day.\u201d Husband contends that\n\nhe did not receive the original package until September 28. Relying on Canaras v. Lift\n\nTruck Services, Inc., 272 Md. 337 (1974), Husband argues that \u201c[w]hether a provision in a\n\ncontract is a condition the nonfulfillment of which excuses performance depends upon the\n\nintent of the parties to be ascertained from a fair and reasonable construction of the\n\nlanguage used in light of all the surrounding circumstance[s] when they executed the\n\ncontract.\u201d\n\nHusband also relies on section 41 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts for the\n\nproposition that whether an offer is accepted within a reasonable amount of time \u201cis a\n\fquestion of fact[,] depending on all the circumstances existing when the offer and attempted\n\nacceptance are made.\u201d And he argues that he \u201cacted as quickly and as reasonably under\n\nthe facts and circumstances of this case as he could\u201d to fully execute the settlement\n\ndocuments.\n\nFinally, Husband contends that even if Wife imposed a September 25 deadline for\n\nacceptance, she waived it. According to Husband, Wife never communicated her rejection\n\nof the Agreement until she responded to his motion to enforce the Agreement. And, he\n\nmaintains, the circuit court determined that Wife knew Husband could not sign the\n\ndocuments until Monday and that Husband\u2019s counsel was not in his office to accept their\n\ndelivery. Thus, he argues, the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in finding that\n\nWife \u201cwaived strict compliance with her attempted condition[.]\u201d\n\nB\n\nProperty settlement agreements are analyzed under the same principles as other\n\ncontracts. Bruce v. Dyer, 309 Md. 421, 439 (1987). 2 Mutual assent is a prerequisite to the\n In a divorce proceeding, one of the benefits of entering into a property settlement\nagreement is that it provides a basis to obtain a divorce on an expedited basis based on\nmutual consent. But to do that, the parties must put their agreement in writing and submit\nit to the court, which in turn must make a finding that the best interests of the parties\u2019 minor\nchildren, if any, are served by the agreement. FL \u00a7 7-103(a)(3). There is no dispute that\nHusband and Wife intended to put in writing any agreement they reached so that they could\nproceed with a divorce on that basis. This is important because the dissent seems to think\nthat because Wife and Husband, through their counsel, negotiated and agreed upon the\nvarious terms of the Agreement in the days and hours leading up to Wife signing the\nAgreement, there was no going back\u2014that those terms were final and binding before either\nparty even signed the Agreement. To the contrary, it is clear from the testimony that neither\nparty intended to be bound until the Agreement was finalized and signed, and neither party\nargued to the contrary in this Court.\n\fformation of a contract, which means that the contract terms are definite and that the parties\n\nintend to be bound by them. Cochran v. Norkunas, 398 Md. 1, 14 (2007). And \u201cthe\n\nacceptance of the other party must correspond with the offer in its entirety.\u201d Peoples Drug\n\nStores v. Fenton Realty Corp., 191 Md. 489, 494 (1948). Here, neither party contends that\n\nthe proposed Agreement\u2019s terms were not certain or definite. And both parties agree that\n\nWife was the offeror. The sole issue is whether there was an offer and acceptance, without\n\nwhich there can be no mutual assent.\n\nAn offer can come with or without conditions. As this Court stated 92 years ago:\n\nSince the offeror was at liberty to make no offer, it was free to determine and\n impose whatever terms it might choose, and among these it might require\n that its offer be accepted within a designated time in a specific manner. If no\n acceptance is made in the manner and within the period fixed by the offer,\n the offer necessarily expires. Williston on Contracts, secs. 53, 61, 76; Van\n Camp Packing Co. v. Smith, 101 Md. 565, 61 A. 284.\n\nAm. Med. Spirits Co. v. Mayor & City Council of Balt., 165 Md. 128, 133 (1933). This\n\ntime-tested rule makes sense: Contracts are voluntary undertakings; thus, it\u2019s not the\n\ncourt\u2019s place to pass judgment on the wisdom, necessity, or fairness of the conditions an\n\nofferor attaches to her offer. Perhaps Wife had her reasons; perhaps not. Legally, it doesn\u2019t\n\nmatter.\n\nNor does it matter what Husband thought the cover letter meant. An offer is\n\ninterpreted based on \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have\n\nthought it meant.\u201d Ray v. Eurice & Bros., Inc., 201 Md. 115, 127 (1952) (quoting 1 Samuel\n\nWilliston & George J. Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 94 (2d ed.)). As\n\nwe explained 73 years ago:\n\f Williston . . . states the rule as follows: \u201cThe only intent of the parties to a\n contract which is essential[] is an intent to say the words and do the acts\n which constitute their manifestation[s] of assent.\u201d\n\nId. at 127 (quoting 1 Williston & Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 21). 3\n\nHere, there was no ambiguity in the September 25 signature deadline; thus, its\n\ninterpretation is a matter of law that we review without deference. See Adventist\n\nHealthcare, Inc. v. Behram, 488 Md. 410, 432 (2024) (\u201cThe interpretation of a contract,\n\nincluding the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law\n\nreviewed without deference.\u201d). Whether the letter imposed a hard signature deadline does\n\nnot hinge on the credibility of the parties\u2019 respective testimony. What matters is what the\n\ncover letter said and the legal effect of its words.\n\nThe cover letter stated:\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nAlthough the letter was not admitted into evidence, the contents of the entire first\n\nparagraph above were elicited verbatim and confirmed by both Husband and Wife in their\n\ntestimony. The letter expressly distinguishes between the Agreement and Note, which had\n\nto be signed on September 25, and the Guaranty, which could be signed on September 28.\n\nThus, any reasonable person in the parties\u2019 positions would understand that Wife\u2019s offer\n See footnote 4 for an explanation of the legal effect of the words used to express\nan offer.\n\fwas conditioned on Husband signing the Agreement and Note on September 25.\n\nConversely, no reasonable person would perceive any flexibility in that deadline.\n\nC\n\nThat Wife imposed the condition in the cover letter and not within the four corners\n\nof the Agreement is also irrelevant. \u201cIt is hornbook law that an offer of no specified\n\nduration must be accepted within a time reasonable under the circumstances or the offer\n\nwill lapse and a subsequent attempt to accept will be of no effect.\u201d Barnes v. Euster, 240\n\nMd. 603, 607 (1965). It is equally true that \u201can offer that has been extended, but not yet\n\naccepted, generally can be withdrawn by the offeror.\u201d Hall v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty.\n\nDemocratic Cent. Comm., 431 Md. 108, 131 (2013); see also Lemlich v. Bd. of Trs. of\n\nHarford Cmty. Coll., 282 Md. 495, 502 (1978) (\u201cIt is so basic a contract principle that\n\nminimal supporting authority is needed to authorize the statement that there must exist an\n\noffer by one party and an unconditional acceptance of that precise offer by the other, prior\n\nto withdrawal by the offeror, before a binding agreement is born.\u201d); Coleman v.\n\nApplegarth, 68 Md. 21, 29 (1887).\n\nThe withdrawal of a condition can be communicated in various ways, including\n\nthrough written communication. See Pavel Enters., Inc. v. A.S. Johnson Co., Inc., 342 Md.\n\n143, 163 (1996) (finding that the offer was withdrawn by the offeror by a letter to the\n\nofferee expressing an intent to withdraw); James L. Kernan Co. v. Cook, 162 Md. 137, 143\n\n(1932) (finding that an offer had been revoked via a letter from the offeror). Obviously, no\n\nmatter how the offeror communicates a withdrawal, one thing is certain: a withdrawal\n\nwould never be contained in the proposed contract; that is, an offeror cannot\n\fsimultaneously extend and withdraw an offer. So even if Wife had not imposed any\n\ncondition in her cover letter, and so long as Husband had not already accepted it, she could\n\nhave withdrawn the offer in a separate letter at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, September 26, or\n\nat any other time of her choosing. The only difference here is that Wife communicated the\n\nexpiration of the offer in advance, when she conveyed the offer. Basic logic dictates that if\n\nthe withdrawal of an offer can be (and always is) communicated outside of the proposed\n\ncontract after the offer is made, so too can a deadline for accepting an offer when the offer\n\nis made.\n\nD\n\nWe turn now to Husband\u2019s contention that Wife waived compliance with the\n\nSeptember 25 signature deadline. Waiver is \u201cthe intentional relinquishment of a known\n\nright.\u201d Taylor v. Mandel, 402 Md. 109, 135 (2007). Waiver must be clearly communicated\n\nor implied from the circumstances. See Myers v. Kayhoe, 391 Md. 188, 205 (2006) (stating\n\nthat waiver \u201cmust be clearly established and will not be inferred from equivocal acts or\n\nlanguage\u201d); Canaras, 272 Md. at 360-61 (stating that for waiver to be established through\n\nimplication or mutual understanding, there must be evidence of a party\u2019s conduct\n\ndemonstrating relinquishment of a right).\n\nHusband leans heavily on his contention that the circuit court found that Wife knew\n\nHusband could not sign the documents until Monday and that Wife knew Husband\u2019s\n\ncounsel was not at the office to take delivery of the settlement package. Even if those facts\n\nwere true, it would not matter. An offeror\u2019s freedom to impose any conditions on her offer\n\nis not constrained by the offeree\u2019s ability, or lack thereof, to satisfy those conditions.\n\f Wife\u2019s silence after receiving the documents from Husband on September 28\n\nlikewise did not constitute a waiver. When Husband signed the documents on September\n\n28, Wife\u2019s offer had already expired, see Am. Med. Spirits Co., 165 Md. at 133, and thus,\n\nthere was no offer for Husband to accept. As a matter of law, when Husband delivered the\n\nsigned documents to Wife (through counsel) on September 28, Husband made his own\n\noffer\u2014some would call it a counteroffer\u2014to Wife. That counteroffer put the power of\n\nacceptance in Wife\u2019s hands, as the new offeree. Wife had no duty to respond to Husband\u2019s\n\ncounteroffer, and there is no evidence that she did respond, either in words or in deeds,\n\nuntil she timely filed her answer to Husband\u2019s amended complaint, in which she\n\nunambiguously disputed the validity of the Agreement.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that silence can never amount to an acceptance. Acceptance\n\nthrough silence can occur if: (1) the parties agreed to that effect in advance, (2) there was\n\na prior course of dealings that indicated such an understanding, or (3) the offeree accepts\n\nany benefits of the agreement. See id. But there is no evidence to support any of those\n\nexceptions here. Thus, Wife\u2019s mere silence, without more, was not an acceptance of\n\nHusband\u2019s offer. See Cochran, 398 Md. at 23-24.\n\nE\n\nHusband argues that the circuit court improperly excluded evidence of the parties\u2019\n\ncommunications in the days and hours leading up to the hand delivery of the Agreement to\n\nHusband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office. As he did before the Appellate Court, Husband argues that, at\n\na minimum, we should remand the matter for the circuit court to consider those exhibits.\n\nWe have considered all the exhibits in the record, and we determine that, as a matter of\n\flaw, no contract was formed due to Husband\u2019s failure to adhere to Wife\u2019s deadline, and\n\nthat the evidence, including the excluded exhibits, does not support the circuit court\u2019s\n\nwaiver finding.\n\nThose emails, had they been admitted, would have established the following:\n\n\u2022 September 24 at 9:37 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel responded to Husband\u2019s proposals\n regarding personal property and financial responsibility for home repairs. Wife\u2019s\n counsel closed the email saying: \u201cIf this is acceptable, I will include your\n revisions in the Agreement, add the repair language above, and have [Wife] sign\n the Agreement for your client\u2019s counter-signing.\u201d Thus, Husband was on notice\n to expect the signed documents from Wife that same day.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 8:16 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel emailed to Wife\u2019s counsel a draft\n of the Guaranty with both counsel\u2019s and Husband\u2019s corporate counsel\u2019s\n comments and edits. Husband\u2019s counsel advised that \u201c[Husband\u2019s corporate\n counsel] has not addressed some things still.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:17 a.m.: Referring to the Guaranty, Wife\u2019s counsel asked\n Husband\u2019s counsel: \u201cWhen can we expect [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\u2019s final\n comments? If not done this morning, I suppose this will have to be done next\n week sometime.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:40 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cWe can execute the\n other documents today though. I have no problem with that. The Guaranty is\n agreed.\u201d Thus, it was Husband\u2019s counsel, not Wife\u2019s counsel, who planted the\n idea that Husband would sign the Agreement and Note, but not the Guaranty,\n that same day. Husband\u2019s counsel never retracted that suggestion.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:52 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel proposed revised language\n regarding the repairs to the marital home before it could be sold and told\n Husband\u2019s counsel that Husband\u2019s proposed changes to the Guaranty were\n accepted \u201cexcept for the striking of the attorneys[\u2019] fees provision. My partner\n has included the same 10% attorneys[\u2019] fees provision as is in the Promissory\n Note.\u201d The email closed with: \u201cIf these changes are accepted, we can finish up.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 11:04 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI sent this to [Husband].\u201d\n And referring to the proposed changes to the home repair provisions, Husband\u2019s\n counsel said, \u201cI am fine with it as long as it is clear it is an exception to the\n\f general language that [Husband] is solely responsible for upkeep of the house\n and bills.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 1:59 p.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel attached a revised Guaranty\n reflecting the change to the attorneys\u2019 fees provision mentioned in the prior\n email, and informed Husband\u2019s counsel that: \u201cthe signed and notarized\n Agreement, the Note and Guaranty will be delivered to your office in the next\n half hour. The [cover] letter is attached to this e-mail as well.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s\n counsel was informed about the signature deadline in the early afternoon of\n September 25. And Husband testified that he saw that email and was aware that\n the signed Agreement and Note would be delivered to his counsel\u2019s office.\n Husband testified that he received the cover letter attached to that email.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:31 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\n is there.\u201d This was when Wife\u2019s counsel first learned that Husband\u2019s counsel\n was not in his office.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:39 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel told Wife\u2019s counsel that he asked\n Husband\u2019s corporate counsel to expedite his review of the Guaranty and stated:\n \u201cIf it needs to be edited at all I will let you know.\u201d Husband\u2019s counsel added:\n \u201cFortunately [Husband] was ok with the principle regarding the house repairs as\n you set forth in your earlier email. I do need to review myself and if I have any\n tweak[s] I will let you know.\u201d Thus, Husband was engaged in the settlement\n process on September 25, notwithstanding his illness.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:27 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel wrote to Wife\u2019s counsel: \u201cI know\n you are out, and am sorry to bother. But could you have someone send me via\n email the version of the Separation Agreement you had her sing [sic] and sent to\n my office please. I am not there at all today.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s counsel\n appreciated the importance of getting the documents to Husband for his\n signature that day, as opposed to waiting for the following Monday.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:57 p.m.: Responding to Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s 1:59 p.m. email,\n Husband\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cThis should be fine. [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\n had no more additions.\u201d Again, no mention of any concern with the signature\n deadline.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:51 p.m.: Someone from Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s office emailed the\n settlement agreement package to Husband\u2019s counsel as requested in the latter\u2019s\n email at 3:27 p.m.\n\f These emails would have provided no support for the circuit court\u2019s finding that\n\nHusband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer or that Wife waived the signature deadline. Thus,\n\nwe agree with the Appellate Court that a remand for that purpose is unnecessary. 4\n\nJUDGMENT OF THE APPELLATE\n COURT OF MARYLAND\n We respectfully disagree with the analysis of our dissenting colleagues. This case\nis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about whether the Agreement constituted a\nbinding contract under basic principles of offer and acceptance. The dissent\u2019s reliance on\nthe terms of the Agreement, including the provisions confirming the voluntariness of the\nparties\u2019 signatures, the effective date of September 25, 2020, the integration clause, and\nothers, are misplaced. For the same reason, so too is the dissent\u2019s reliance on the parol\nevidence rule. Had Husband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer, all the terms of the Agreement\nwould have been binding, and parol evidence would not have been permitted to vary them.\n The dissent contends that we should attribute no significance to the cover letter\nbecause it was excluded as hearsay. But the dissent overlooks that both parties, in their\ntestimony, testified about and confirmed the cover letter\u2019s contents verbatim, and without\nobjection. So even if the substance of the cover letter constituted hearsay, any objection on\nthat basis was waived, as its contents were in evidence and undisputed. Thus, the existence\nof the September 25th deadline for the execution of the Agreement did not hinge on\nanyone\u2019s credibility.\n The dissent\u2019s focus on the hearsay issue underscores a broader misunderstanding of\nthe legal import of the cover letter and the evidentiary purpose it served. \u201c\u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). The\ncontents of the cover letter were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather\nfor the legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter\nwith such contents constituted an act with independent legal significance. See State v.\nYoung, 462 Md. 159, 175 (2018).\n Such acts include the making and acceptance of an offer. Garner v. State, 414 Md.\n372, 382 (2010). For example, if a person were to say to a car owner \u201cI offer you $200 for\nyour car and the offer expires in 15 minutes,\u201d that statement would be admissible for the\nlegal effect of uttering those words, which are twofold: (1) the person offered to buy the\ncar for $200 and put the power of acceptance in the owner\u2019s hands; and (2) the owner\u2019s\npower of acceptance expires in 15 minutes. If the owner wasn\u2019t listening and did not learn\nabout the offer until after it expired (perhaps when the person later said to the owner that\nthe person was surprised that the owner didn\u2019t accept it), as a matter of law, this would not\nmatter. Nor would it matter that the owner never agreed to the unilateral deadline. As the\nofferor, the person had the unfettered unilateral right to dictate the terms of the offer and\nany acceptance deadline. The same principles apply here.\n\f AFFIRMED.

PATTISON\n\nv.\n\nDEBORAH PATTISON\n\n______________________________________\n\nFader, C.J.,\n Watts,\n Booth,\n Biran,\n Gould,\n Eaves,\n Killough,\n\nJJ.\n ______________________________________\n\nDissenting Opinion by Killough, J., which\n Eaves, J., joins.\n ______________________________________\n\nFiled: July 23, 2025\n\f I respectfully dissent from the Majority\u2019s opinion reversing the trial court\u2019s\n\nenforcement of the marital settlement agreement in this case. In my view, the Majority\u2019s\n\nframing of the case through an \u201coffer and acceptance\u201d construct is misplaced. The parties\n\nhad already negotiated and agreed to all material terms of a settlement, reduced that\n\nagreement to writing, and Respondent (referred to herein as \u201cWife\u201d or \u201cMs. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned, initialed, and notarized the agreement. Her signature reflected her unequivocal\n\nassent to be bound. When Petitioner (referred to herein as \u201cHusband\u201d or \u201cMr. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned the agreement on September 28, 2020, there was no open offer left to accept or\n\nreject \u2013 only a binding agreement to be enforced.\n\nThe Majority cites no case \u2013 and I am aware of none \u2013 in which a court has set aside\n\na fully executed, integrated agreement based solely on a purported condition precedent\n\nfound in an extrinsic document. Yet that is precisely the result the Majority reaches.\n\nAccording to the Majority, \u201cany reasonable person\u201d would have understood Wife\u2019s\n\ndirective that Husband sign the agreement on September 25, 2020, as a binding condition\n\nprecedent to contract formation, and \u201c[c]onversely, no reasonable person would perceive\n\nany flexibility in that deadline.\u201d Majority Op. at 9-10. But that is not what the trial court\n\nfound. There is no evidence that this so-called \u201cdirective\u201d was timely conveyed to Husband\n\nor that he acknowledged it. This \u201cdirective\u201d was not contained in the agreement, but rather\n\nappeared only in a cover letter dated September 25, 2020, authored by Wife\u2019s counsel and\n\nenclosing the agreement (the \u201cCover Letter\u201d). Husband did not testify that he read the\n\nCover Letter before the deadline passed or that he understood it to impose any binding\n\ncondition. Neither party\u2019s counsel testified as to what, if any, communications occurred\n\fregarding a deadline. Most notably, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as\n\nhearsay.\n\nIn effect, the Majority invalidates a fully executed, integrated settlement agreement\n\nbased entirely on an excluded hearsay document \u2013 a remarkably thin evidentiary reed on\n\nwhich to overturn not only a signed contract but also the trial court\u2019s supported factual\n\nfindings. In my view, the trial court got it right. Given the deference owed to a trial court\u2019s\n\nfindings, and in light of Maryland\u2019s strong policy favoring settlements and the efficient\n\nadministration of justice, see Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., 251 Md. 544, 550 (1968),\n\ncert. denied, 394 U.S. 974 (1969), I would affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n\nI.\n\nFacts\n\nI agree with the factual background set forth in the Majority opinion and will only\n\nsummarize additional facts in this opinion as needed.\n\nAfter a hearing on the Petitioner\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement, the trial judge\n\nruled on March 17, 2021, that the parties had reached a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement following extensive negotiations. After spending approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a former judge of the Supreme Court of Maryland and engaging in nearly\n\nthree weeks of back-and-forth negotiation, the parties agreed on all material terms of a\n\nsettlement and reduced that agreement to writing. The agreement, finalized by Wife\u2019s\n\nattorney, was memorialized in a twelve\u2010page \u201cVoluntary Separation and Property\n\nSettlement Agreement\u201d (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d).\n\f The uncontroverted record shows that Wife signed and initialed each page of the\n\nSettlement Agreement and dated it September 25, 2020. Wife had the Settlement\n\nAgreement notarized, certifying that she personally appeared before the notary to\n\n\u201cexecute[] this Agreement and made oath in due form of law that the matters and facts set\n\nforth in the foregoing Agreement true and correct as stated in the Agreement, and [that she]\n\nacknowledged that the Agreement is in fact her free act and deed and that she has full\n\nunderstanding of its terms.\u201d Husband signed and notarized the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms are undisputed: it became effective on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. The Settlement Agreement is fully integrated and prohibits any\n\namendments without mutual written consent. Both parties declared that the terms of the\n\nagreement were \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d and that they signed the agreement \u201cfreely and\n\nvoluntarily.\u201d Based on its analysis of the agreement, the trial court held that the parties\u2019\n\n\u201cintent can be determined from the unambiguous language in the [Settlement Agreement].\u201d\n\nConsequently, the trial court found that the Settlement Agreement was valid and\n\nenforceable as of September 25, 2020, and that there was mutual assent by the parties to\n\nbe bound by its terms.\n\nWife argued that there was no mutual assent to contract because Husband did not\n\ncomply with her demand in the Cover Letter that he sign the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. In that letter, Wife\u2019s counsel wrote, \u201c[t]his Agreement is delivered\n\nto you in settlement of the parties\u2019 outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement\n\nand Note be executed by Mr. Pattison today.\u201d But the Cover Letter was excluded from\n\fevidence as inadmissible hearsay. During the hearing, however, Wife\u2019s counsel read\n\nexcerpts from the Cover Letter to Husband and he was questioned as to whether he was\n\nfamiliar with the letter. The authors and recipients of the hearsay documents did not testify.\n\nHusband testified that he first saw the original copy of the Settlement Agreement\n\nwith Wife\u2019s signature \u201c[o]n the morning of Monday, September 28th, 2020.\u201d Because he\n\nwas quarantined after testing positive for Covid, he made arrangements with his attorney\n\nto have the Settlement Agreement dropped off on the sidewalk outside his home. He then\n\nsigned the Settlement Agreement, had it notarized, and returned it to his counsel. Husband\n\ntestified that he saw an emailed version of the Settlement Agreement at some point after 5\n\np.m. on Friday, September 25. He was not sure if that email version he saw was signed by\n\nMs. Pattison. No exhibit was admitted into evidence that purported to be the emailed\n\nversion of the Settlement Agreement or Cover Letter. The Cover Letter itself does not\n\nindicate that it was emailed to Mr. Pattison or his counsel but indicates that Ms. Pattison\n\nwas copied on the email.\n\nWife testified that she signed the Settlement Agreement \u201caround noon\u201d on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, and instructed her counsel to deliver it \u201cwith condition that the\n\nAgreement and Note be executed by Mr. Pattison that Friday.\u201d Yet she neither directly\n\ncommunicated that condition to Husband nor did Husband testify specifically that he saw\n\nthe Cover Letter on that date. There is no evidence in the record of whether the attorneys\n\ncommunicated with each other about the deadline contained in the Cover Letter. What we\n\ndo know is that the Settlement Agreement contained no such deadline; Wife never\n\fconveyed one directly; and neither attorney was in the office late Friday afternoon,\n\nSeptember 25, to receive the executed documents.\n\nThe trial court ruled that the language of the Settlement Agreement\n\n\u201cunambiguously[] indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into a[n] . . . agreement\n\non September 25th, 2020 to settle all matters[.]\u201d With respect to the alleged condition\n\nprecedent, all that the trial judge had before her were the parties\u2019 competing testimonies \u2013\n\nHusband\u2019s testimony that he never understood September 25, 2020, to be a firm cutoff, and\n\nWife\u2019s recollections of her instructions to her counsel regarding the alleged condition\n\nprecedent. The trial court relied on neither the Cover Letter nor the emails between counsel\n\nthat it excluded from evidence. On that record, the trial court found the alleged deadline\n\nuncommunicated and unenforceable, holding that \u201c[a]fter consideration of the evidence\n\nand considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The trial court further\n\nreasoned that \u201c[e]ven if for argument sake communication that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a time limit, contract formation still would have occurred through the action of\n\nthe parties.\u201d\n\nII.\n\nStandard of Review\n\nWhen an action is tried without a jury, an appellate court reviews both the law and\n\nthe evidence. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The trial court\u2019s factual findings \u2013 including findings\n\nbased on witness credibility, inferences from conduct, and the surrounding context of an\n\nalleged agreement \u2013 are reviewed for clear error. See Torboli v. Torboli, 127 Md. App.\n\f666, 672 (1999). The appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party, City of Bowie v. MIE Props., Inc., 398 Md. 657, 676 (2007) and resolves\n\nall evidentiary conflicts in the prevailing party\u2019s favor. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Steele\n\nSoftware Sys. Corp., 154 Md. App. 97, 107 n.1 (2003), cert. denied, 380 Md. 619 (2004);\n\nsee also Brault Graham, LLC v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., 211 Md. App. 638,\n\n659 (2013) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and\n\nreviews the trial court's legal conclusions de novo.\u201d). If there is any competent and material\n\nevidence to support the court\u2019s findings, those findings cannot be held clearly erroneous.\n\nL.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Md. Nat\u2019l Golf, L.P., 165 Md. App. 339, 343 (2005).\n\nIII.\n\nDiscussion\n\nI disagree with the Majority that Wife imposed a valid condition precedent to the\n\nformation of the Settlement Agreement through the Cover Letter. The parties agreed to\n\nsettle this case effective September 25, 2020, as evidenced by their notarized signatures on\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The terms and conditions of their settlement are reflected in\n\nthat agreement. Nowhere in the Settlement Agreement is there a timing provision on\n\nsigning the agreement or any reference to the Cover Letter. Moreover, the Cover Letter\n\nwas deemed hearsay by the trial court and was not admitted into evidence. At most,\n\nwhether Wife imposed a valid condition precedent presented a disputed factual question \u2013\n\nnamely, whether she clearly and effectively communicated a firm deadline for Husband to\n\nsign the agreement on September 25, 2020. The trial court answered that question in the\n\nnegative and its finding is well supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.\n\f A.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That There Was Mutual Assent\n For the Settlement Agreement Is Entitled to Deference\n\nThe trial court correctly found that the parties reached mutual assent to settle the\n\ncase effective September 25, 2020. After nearly three weeks of back-and-forth\n\nnegotiations and multiple drafts, Wife\u2019s counsel prepared the final agreement, which Wife\n\nsigned in two original copies, initialed on each page, and had notarized. Husband likewise\n\ntestified that he agreed to all the terms and conditions. The trial court found that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was fully integrated and effective under its express terms on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. There was no allegation of duress, fraud, or mistake. 1 Wife signed\n\nof her own volition, fully represented by counsel, and under no compulsion to execute the\n\ndocument. Husband did the same on Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nThe trial court concluded that the Settlement Agreement:\n\n[U]nambiguously, indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into\n a voluntary separation and property agreement on September 25th, 2020 to\n settle all matters of every kind and character arising from their marital\n relationship.\n\nAs a result, this Court finds that the threshold issue of whether mutual\n assent, the essential prerequisite to the creation or formation of a contract,\n has occurred.\n\nI find that the trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion are well-supported by the\n\nevidentiary record in this case.\n Wife alleged duress in her motion to set aside the Settlement Agreement, but did\nnot introduce any evidence of duress at the hearing, and ultimately withdrew the motion.\n\f The trial court further determined that because the parties\u2019 intent to form a contract\n\ncould be gleaned from the unambiguous language contained in the Settlement Agreement,\n\nconsideration of the Cover Letter was not appropriate because it was barred by the parol\n\nevidence rule. I agree with this ruling as well. See Calomiris v. Wood, 353 Md. 425, 361-\n\n62 (1999) (\u201cUnder the parol evidence rule, a written agreement \u2018discharges prior\n\nagreements,\u2019 thereby rendering legally inoperative communications and negotiations\n\nleading up to the written contract.\u201d) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\n\n213 (1979)).\n\nThere is ample competent evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding of a binding\n\ncontract: the fully executed, integrated, and notarized Settlement Agreement itself, Wife\u2019s\n\ndelivery of the signed originals, and Husband\u2019s express acceptance of its terms. The trial\n\ncourt credited this direct evidence in finding mutual assent \u2013 a finding we review only for\n\nclear error. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The Majority ignores the trial court\u2019s finding of mutual\n\nassent and its interpretation of the express terms of the Settlement Agreement. Instead, the\n\nMajority relies on an excluded post hoc hearsay document to conclude that Wife\u2019s\n\npurported \u201coffer\u201d had not been \u201caccepted\u201d and expired at midnight on September 25. As\n\ndiscussed below, I disagree with this approach because it rewrites the factual record,\n\ndisregards the trial court\u2019s firsthand credibility determinations, and relies on excluded\n\nhearsay to reach its conclusion.\n\f B.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Wife Did Not Impose\n A Valid Condition Precedent Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\nHaving determined that the fully executed, integrated Settlement Agreement was\n\nbinding and enforceable as of September 25, 2020, the trial court also evaluated whether\n\nWife\u2019s testimony \u2013 that she conditioned her offer on Husband\u2019s signing by that date \u2013 was\n\nsupported by the evidence. The trial court found that it was not, explaining: \u201cAfter\n\nconsideration of the evidence and considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find\n\nthat Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer included a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d\n\nBecause that factual finding is entitled to deference under Maryland Rule 8-131(c) unless\n\n\u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d see Mercy Medical Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare of the Mid-Atl.,\n\nInc., 149 Md. App. 336, 355 (2003), and because the record amply supports that finding,\n\nthe trial court ruling should be affirmed.\n\nThe reasons offered by the Majority to overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling are\n\nunpersuasive.\n\nFirst, the Cover Letter could not impose a valid condition precedent to formation of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The letter was drafted after Wife had already executed the\n\nSettlement Agreement, contains no reference to any signature deadline, and cannot\n\nretroactively alter a contract already formed as of September 25. A condition precedent by\n\ndefinition must exist at the moment of contract formation; it cannot be grafted on by a\n\nunilateral post-execution communication.\n\f Second, there is no evidence that any deadline was directly conveyed to Mr. Pattison\n\nprior to midnight on September 25, much less that he acknowledged or ratified such a\n\ndeadline. No one \u2013 neither Mr. Pattison, the attorneys, nor Ms. Pattison \u2013 testified that a\n\nSeptember 25, 2020 deadline was expressly conveyed to Mr. Pattison. Mr. Pattison\n\nacknowledged receiving and being familiar with the Cover Letter; but that does not\n\nestablish that he read or understood the letter as of the evening of September 25, or that he\n\nregarded it as imposing a binding deadline.\n\nMr. Pattison was asked directly whether he understood there to be \u201ca condition that\n\nyou sign the agreement and the note on September 25.\u201d He responded: \u201cThat\u2019s not\n\ncorrect.\u201d He elaborated:\n\nBecause the next sentence [of the Cover Letter] says, \u2018I will assume that we\n will have a final guaranty signed by Mr. Pattison by close of business on\n Monday.\u2019 My interpretation was [Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney] needed all the\n executed documents by Monday, because without the personal guaranty and\n the promissory note, the settlement agreement is unenforceable.\n\nMr. Pattison further testified that he understood there to be no deadline or expiration\n\ndate for his signature on the Settlement Agreement. He believed, based on his attorney\u2019s\n\ncommunications with Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney, that the parties had reached agreement on\n\nall terms as of Friday, September 25, 2020, and that he was obligated to sign the personal\n\nguaranty and promissory note in the days that followed. When asked if it was his position\n\nthat he could sign the settlement documents on Monday, September 28, when he provided\n\nthe final guaranty, Mr. Pattison answered: \u201cMy position has always been that.\u201d\n\nI disagree with the Majority opinion that Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was\n\nirrelevant. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was informed, at least\n\fin part, on his understanding that he and Wife had agreed to all outstanding issues effective\n\nSeptember 25 as evidenced by Wife\u2019s execution of the Settlement Agreement. With respect\n\nto the timing of his signature, Mr. Pattison understood that he could execute all of the\n\nsettlement documents on Monday, September 28. The trial court credited that testimony,\n\nand it provided a reasonable basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that there was no clear\n\ncondition precedent tied to the September 25 date.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s citation to Ray v. Eurice & Bros, Inc., 201 Md. 115 (1952) is\n\nmisplaced. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Ray and its progeny stand for the principle that a\n\nparty\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant when interpreting the terms of a contract that both\n\nparties signed. Here, it is undisputed that the Cover Letter was not incorporated into the\n\nSettlement Agreement, was not signed or agreed to by Husband (or perhaps timely seen),\n\nand, importantly, never admitted into evidence. Since the Cover Letter was not part of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Ray does not resolve whether that letter\u2019s terms \u2013 standing alone \u2013\n\ncreate a legally enforceable condition precedent. As the trial court correctly recognized,\n\nthey did not.\n\nThird, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as inadmissible hearsay and its\n\ncontents cannot be considered on appellate review as a basis for overturning the trial court\u2019s\n\nfactual findings. 2 Wife did not challenge that exclusion on appeal, so we should not\n The Majority\u2019s analytical variability on the trial court\u2019s findings below is\nunderscored by its effort to recast the Cover Letter as non-hearsay. See Majority Op. at 15\nn.4. The Majority argues that the Cover Letter was not offered for its truth, but rather \u201cfor\nthe legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter with\nsuch contents constituted an act with independent legal significance.\u201d But that effect\n\freconsider its exclusion now. See Md. Rule 8-131(a); Robinson v. State, 404 Md. 208, 217\n\n(2008). The fact that Wife\u2019s counsel read the contents of the Cover Letter to Husband and\n\nWife during questioning does not transform inadmissible material into admissible\n\nevidence. See cf. Clermont v. State, 348 Md. 419, 429 (1998) (defense counsel\u2019s statement\n\ndid not constitute as evidence and was properly struck from the record). It is manifestly\n\nunfair to strike down a contract based on a document the trial court neither admitted into\n\nevidence nor relied upon in its ruling. The Majority cites no case to the contrary.\n\nFourth, the Majority overlooks the fact that the Cover Letter was both legally and\n\npractically incapable of imposing a same-day deadline. Because the Settlement Agreement\n\ndid not include a counterpart clause, Mr. Pattison was not authorized to simply signed an\n\nemail copy of the agreement as the Majority suggests. Such a clause typically allows\n\ncontracts to be executed in \u201ccounterparts, and each counterpart will have the same force\n\nand effect as an original and will constitute an effective, binding agreement on the part of\n\neach of the undersigneds.\u201d See Alan S. Gutterman, Business Transactions Solutions \u00a7\n\nhinges on the recipient\u2019s timely awareness of \u201cWife\u2019s expression of the deadline\u201d \u2013 a\nfactual dispute the trial court resolved in Husband\u2019s favor. Indeed, the very case the\nMajority cites \u2013 Garner v. State, 414 Md. 372 (2010) \u2013 undermines the notion that it does\nnot matter if the offeree \u201cdid not learn about the offer until after it expired.\u201d Majority Op.\nat 15 n.4. In order to constitute non-hearsay, a \u201cverbal act\u201d must not only have independent\nlegal significance, but also is clearly communicated to the recipient to give it evidentiary\nsignificance. Garner, 414 Md. at 382 (\u201ccan I get a 40\u201d was a verbal act with legal\nsignificance and actually received by the listener). More fundamentally, the time to invoke\nthis argument has long passed. Unlike in Garner, where the hearsay issue was appealed,\nWife did not raise this argument before the trial court. Neither party challenged the\nexclusion of the Cover Letter on appeal, and both structured their proofs at trial\naccordingly. Waiver and failure to preserve preclude this Court from reversing the trial\ncourt\u2019s evidentiary ruling. The Majority cites no authority permitting it to revive and rely\non excluded hearsay at this stage \u2013 and I know of none.\n\f113:130 (Thomson Reuters 2010). These clauses are standard when parties are expected\n\nto sign at different times or locations. Indeed, the Cover Letter acknowledged that Ms.\n\nPattison had already signed both originals and instructed Mr. Pattison to \u201ccounter-execute\u201d\n\nthem \u2013 not sign an email copy. Thus, this instruction contemplated sequential, not\n\nsimultaneous, execution of the Settlement Agreement. 3\n\nSame-day counter-execution of the Settlement Agreement was also impractical. It\n\nis undisputed that Wife\u2019s counsel sent the executed originals late in the day on Friday,\n\nSeptember 25, to a law office he knew would be closed for the weekend. See Majority Op.\n\nat 13-14. Mr. Pattison, who was incapacitated on September 25 as a result of having Covid,\n\ndid not receive the originals until Monday, September 28. How, then, can the Cover Letter\n\nimpose a \u201cdefinite deadline\u201d requiring execution on September 25, when the documents\n\nwere physically inaccessible to Mr. Pattison until three days later? The Majority offers no\n\nanswer \u2013 only speculation that his counsel could have requested an extension. See Majority\n\nOp. at 15.\n\nFifth, the Majority disregards the trial judge\u2019s credibility determinations. After\n\nhearing testimony from both parties, the judge found that Ms. Pattison did not impose \u201ca\n\ndefinite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The Majority declares credibility\n This is further evidence that the Cover Letter was merely a timing provision that\nWife sought to impose after the fact. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, any temporal gap\nbetween the parties\u2019 respective signatures would reduce every mutually assented to\nagreement to a mere \u201coffer\u201d until the other party signed \u2013 an outcome squarely at odds with\nestablished principles of contract law.\n\f\u201cirrelevant\u201d and instead relies on counsel\u2019s scheduling emails \u2013 which were also excluded\n\nas hearsay \u2013 to conclude that Husband \u201cwas engaged in the settlement process on\n\nSeptember 25, notwithstanding his illness.\u201d Majority Op. at 14. Not only is this conclusion\n\ninconsistent with Mr. Pattison\u2019s testimony, 4 but it also ignores the trial court\u2019s role in\n\nresolving factual disputes.\n\nFinally, the Majority gives short shrift to the standard of review. The trial court,\n\nsitting as fact-finder, heard the evidence, evaluated credibility, and concluded that Wife\n\nfailed to prove the existence of a valid condition precedent. That conclusion was rooted in\n\nthe plain language of the Settlement Agreement, which established the effective date of the\n\nSettlement Agreement as of September 25 and which contained no deadline for Husband\u2019s\n\nsignature, and no express condition precedent. Viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to Husband as the prevailing party, and resolving all evidentiary conflicts in his\n\nfavor, we should affirm rather than second-guess the trial court\u2019s factual findings or fill\n\nevidentiary gaps with unwarranted inferences against him. See Knowles v. Binford, 268\n\nMd. 2, 11 (1972) (\u201c[T]he trial court is not only the judge of a witness\u2019 credibility, but is\n\nalso the judge of the weight to attach to the evidence[.]\u201d).\n\nIV.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to consider the context in which this dispute arose. On\n\nMarch 16, 2021, the trial court convened a two-day enforcement hearing on Husband\u2019s\n Mr. Pattison testified that he was ill with Covid on September 25, 2020, and slept\nmost of the day.\n\fmotion to enforce the Settlement Agreement he and Wife had negotiated and agreed to\n\nthrough counsel. In evidence before the court was the fully executed Settlement\n\nAgreement \u2013 signed, initialed, and notarized by both parties. The terms of the agreement\n\nwere clear and unambiguous.\n\nMs. Pattison seeks to transform an after-the-fact cover letter \u2013 excluded from\n\nevidence as hearsay \u2013 into a condition precedent to contract formation. She contends that\n\nthe agreement sent to Mr. Pattison on September 25, 2020, constituted a mere offer, subject\n\nto automatic withdrawal at midnight unless signed that same day. But this ignores that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was effective as of September 25 and there is no indication in the\n\nrecord that any such \u201ccondition\u201d was clearly communicated to Mr. Pattison. Notably,\n\nneither Ms. Pattison nor her attorney advised Mr. Pattison that the \u201coffer\u201d was withdrawn\n\nafter the supposed deadline passed. To the contrary, when Ms. Pattison received the\n\nexecuted agreement from Mr. Pattison on Monday, September 28, she raised no objections.\n\nIt was not until October 14 \u2013 seventeen days later, and two weeks after Mr. Pattison had\n\nbegun performing under the agreement \u2013 that Ms. Pattison first asserted that no contract\n\nhad been formed due to an unmet condition precedent. 5\n I agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that even assuming the Cover Letter imposed\na valid condition precedent, the record demonstrates that Wife waived that condition by\nher actions. Where an offeror \u201cwho does not in fact insist upon\u201d a time limit and continues\nnegotiations \u201cmay indicate a continued willingness to stand by the terms of its offer,\u201d\nthereby extending the acceptance period and effectively creating a new offer. Williston on\nContracts \u00a7 5:5.\n\f In reversing the trial court\u2019s enforcement of the Settlement Agreement, the Majority\n\nhas effectively announced a new rule of contract construction: a fully executed, integrated\n\nsettlement agreement \u2013 signed, notarized, and negotiated by counsel \u2013 may be set aside if\n\none party can point to any contemporaneous, extrinsic communication arguably\n\nconditioning its formation. That departs from Maryland\u2019s objective theory of contracts, as\n\narticulated in Ray, which holds that \u201c[t]he only intent of the parties to a contract which is\n\nessential, is an intent to say the words and do the acts which constitute their manifestation\n\nof assent,\u201d judged by what a reasonable person in the parties\u2019 position would have\n\nunderstood. Ray, 201 Md. at 127. Even if one party is mistaken, and even if that mistake\n\ncreates a hardship, a clearly expressed, integrated written contract may not be varied by\n\nparol evidence \u2013 absent fraud, duress, or mutual mistake. Id. at 125.\n\nHere, there are no allegations of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake \u2013 nor even a claim\n\nthat enforcement of the agreement would create any hardship. Ms. Pattison simply changed\n\nher mind \u2013 nineteen days after signing the Settlement Agreement \u2013 presumably because\n\nshe decided she wanted more money than what the agreement provided. She even later\n\ndescribed the Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms as \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nBy supplanting the objective inquiry (what does the contract say?) with a subjective\n\none (what do the extrinsic, unincorporated communications say?), the Majority undermines\n\nthe certainty that integrated contracts are meant to provide. 6 The Majority\u2019s opinion invites\n The Majority insists that this case \u201cis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about\n. . . offer and acceptance.\u201d Majority Op. at 15 n.4. Respectfully, that framing collapses\nunder the weight of the record. The trial court expressly found that the parties had already\n\flitigation over cover letters, emails, text messages, social media posts and other collateral\n\ndocuments or media a party may never have seen or agreed to \u2013 and renders enforcement\n\nof even signed, notarized, and fully integrated agreements uncertain.\n\nThe Majority opinion is even more problematic in the family law context, where\n\nemotions run high. By imposing strict black letter law as to offer and acceptance \u2013\n\nincorrectly, as it turns out here \u2013 the Majority opinion could significantly hamper the ability\n\nof judges to resolve these cases. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, a party who develops\n\nbuyer\u2019s remorse, or who for no reason at all wishes to return to the bargaining table without\n\nproviding a basis for doing so, need only append by email, or some separate writing, not\n\nagreed to or considered by the other party, a condition precedent that undercuts a carefully\n\ncrafted agreement that otherwise thoroughly and exclusively states the parties\u2019 mutual\n\nassent. With the Majority\u2019s view, where the record shows no disagreement by Ms. Pattison\n\nas to any term in the actual Settlement Agreement, the trial court\u2019s ability to make\n\ncredibility determinations, and most importantly, to resolve the case, has been effectively\n\nundercut. Ms. Pattison and other family law parties should not benefit from an incorrect\n\nformed a binding contract through mutual assent on September 25th \u2013 offer accepted. A\nmore apt analogy than the one posed by the Majority is where X and Y agree to the $200\ncar sale. Y signs a promissory note for $200, and X signs over title. Two hours later, X\nsends Y a text saying the sale is conditioned on my getting the $200 within the next 15\nminutes. Even where Y actually sees the text message (something that did not happen here\naccording to the trial court), this post hoc condition cannot retroactively alter the binding\nagreement already executed. It is exactly the Majority\u2019s elevation of the unilateral, post-\nexecution Cover Letter over the express and integrated terms of the Settlement Agreement\nthat is problematic, particularly here where the language of the Settlement Agreement\nprecludes precisely the kind of maneuver Wife has now effected with the Majority\u2019s\nendorsement.\n\fconstruct of contract law that prolongs the case by an unexpected condition precedent that\n\nwas wholly unreasonable under the circumstances. Gaming the resolution of family law\n\ncases in this manner benefits no one.\n\nThe trial court made no error in enforcing the Settlement Agreement based on the\n\nevidence before it, and the Majority identifies none \u2013 other than its argument that the\n\ninadmissible post-hoc Cover Letter was a valid condition precedent and is dispositive. The\n\nMajority offers no workable guidance to trial courts facing belated or collateral attacks on\n\nsettlement agreements. When does a \u201ccondition\u201d in a post-execution cover letter become\n\na valid condition precedent? Does mutual assent disappear simply because one party signs\n\nthe contract a few days after the other \u2013 particularly when sequential execution was\n\nanticipated? Does an integration clause preclude the enforcement of extrinsic terms that\n\ncontradict the agreement itself? And what role should trial courts play in enforcing written\n\nagreements when alleged conditions appear nowhere in the agreement and were never\n\nagreed to by the other party? I do not know the answers to these questions after reading\n\nthe Majority opinion. Instead, the Majority provides a roadmap for undoing signed\n\nsettlement agreements, undermining Maryland\u2019s strong public policy in favor of finality\n\nand resolution.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Majority opinion. Justice\n\nEaves has authorized me to state that she joins this dissent.\n\n18"

Answering only the question of liability, a jury found that Open\n\nfraudulently induced the City to enter the contract. The City elected to rescind\n\nthe contract, so the district court held a bench trial on restitution and ordered a\n\njudgment of almost $20 million against Open.\n\nOpen appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denials of its\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law. Because we find no error with the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s rulings or the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm. 2\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nIn February 2018, the City published a request for proposal (RFP) for a\n\nbilling software system for municipal utilities, including a new broadband\n\nutility called Connexion. On March 12, 2018, Open submitted a proposal for\n\nthe project based on its forthcoming software, Open SmartFlex Version 8. Open\n Except where the distinction matters, we refer to Open International and\nOpen Investments collectively as \u201cOpen.\u201d\n On February 19, 2025, Open moved for leave to file a supplemental\nappendix. We deny that motion.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 3\n\nclaimed that its product \u201ccomplie[d] with the vast majority of functional and\n\ntechnical requirements of th[e] RFP with one single and uniform product[.]\u201d\n\nSupp. App. vol. 4, at 1011 (emphasis omitted).\n\nThe RFP included a functional matrix that listed all the functional\n\nrequirements needed for the product and that directed bidders to complete the\n\nmatrix \u201caccurately and factually\u201d according to the provided grading rubric.\n\nSupp. App. vol. 8, at 2143. In its RFP response, Open graded about 90% of its\n\nhomegrown software\u2019s functionalities with \u201cA\u2019s,\u201d representing that the\n\nfunctionality was \u201cpart of [its software\u2019s] base system\u201d and that \u201c[n]o\n\n[m]odification [was] required.\u201d App. vol. 2, at 3.\n\nThe City selected Open International to be its vendor. And the parties\n\nformalized their contract with a Master Professional Services Agreement, in\n\nwhich Open Investments guaranteed Open International\u2019s performance under\n\nthe contract but made no contractual representations of its own. The contract\u2019s\n\nintroduction incorporates by reference the RFP and Open\u2019s proposal, which\n\nincludes the detailed functionality matrix for the services that Open\n\nInternational was to provide.\n\nThe project kicked off in late 2018 and suffered problems from the\n\nbeginning. One of the main sources of conflict was the customer self-service\n\nportal for the City\u2019s broadband-billing services. The service went live in\n\nAugust 2019 and had \u201ccritical functionality missing.\u201d App. vol. 7, at 68\u201369. In\n\nNovember 2019, the City cited the portal as one of its primary concerns, stating\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 4\n\nthat the \u201cportal testing hours [have been] extensive\u201d and that the \u201cpresented\n\nportal was different than what got delivered[.]\u201d App. vol. 9, at 26\u201327.\n\nDespite these problems, the City continued its contractual relationship\n\nwith Open International. Throughout the project, the parties negotiated and\n\nexecuted twenty-nine project change requests (PCRs), including PCR 19, which\n\naddressed issues relating to the customer portal. In a March 2020 memorandum,\n\nthe City\u2019s external project manager documented her concerns over problems\n\nwith Open International\u2019s product, but still recommended that the City preserve\n\nits relationship with Open International. And in June 2020, both parties agreed\n\nto a formal amendment that extended project milestones into 2021 and assigned\n\nmost of the added project costs to the City. The parties again agreed to extend\n\nthe project in December 2020.\n\nPrompted by this second amendment, the City hired a third-party\n\nconsultant to assess the project. In an April 2021 report, the consultant advised\n\nthe City to continue the project with Open International despite the project\n\ndelays and frustrations. Completing the project with Open International\n\nremained \u201cPlan A\u201d for the City. App. vol. 7, at 120\u201321. The parties jointly\n\nreviewed the functional matrix to evaluate whether the program was performing\n\nas Open had represented it would. But during the review in April and May\n\n2021, the City determined that Open\u2019s precontractual assertions about its\n\nsoftware\u2019s capabilities were false.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 5\n\nAlso during the review, Open International sent the City a notice of\n\ndefault stating that it could not proceed with its work unless and until the City\n\ncured certain deficiencies. From the City\u2019s view, that default notice \u201cwas a\n\nsignificant breach of trust.\u201d Id. at 123. Then on May 28, 2021, the City served\n\nits own notices\u2014a notice of dispute and notice of termination. In June, Open\n\nInternational provided a \u201cReset Proposal\u201d that acknowledged the results of the\n\nfunctional matrix audit\u2014which showed that only 17.3% of the \u201c[i]n scope\u201d\n\nrequirements had been accepted\u2014and sought additional funds to complete the\n\nproject. Supp. App. vol. 9, at 2473. But the proposal would not cure the issues\n\nwithin the thirty days required by the contract, so the City initiated this lawsuit\n\non July 2, 2021. The City also promptly retained a second vendor and began\n\nimplementing that product, and it stopped all use of Open International\u2019s\n\nproduct as soon as the new platform was available in December 2021.\n\nII. Procedural Background\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the City sued Open for breach of contract, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, and fraud-in-the-inducement. The City based its tort claims\n\non misrepresentations about (1) the timing for executing the project and the\n\nlevel of support Open International would provide, (2) Open International\u2019s\n\nsoftware being \u201cready for implementation,\u201d and (3) the fitness of Open\n\nInternational\u2019s software for the City\u2019s needs. App. vol. 3, at 60\u201361 \u00b6\u00b6 70\u201373.\n\nOpen pleaded affirmative defenses and asserted a counterclaim for breach of\n\ncontract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 6\n\nDuring discovery, the City learned that despite Open grading almost 90%\n\nof the required functionalities as an \u201cA\u201d in its March 2018 RFP response, Open\n\nhad internally assessed its software as meeting only 59.4% of the required\n\nfunctionalities. Open\u2019s internal assessment was dated in March 2018, before it\n\nresponded to the RFP. Also, the City learned that Open had not graded the\n\nprovided software\u2014a third-party portal called \u201cMilestone\u201d\u2014in the\n\nfunctionality matrix but had instead graded its \u201chomegrown\u201d software. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 254\u201355.\n\nOpen moved for summary judgment on the City\u2019s tort claims, arguing\n\nthat the claims were barred by the contract\u2019s merger clause and Colorado\u2019s\n\neconomic-loss rule, and that the City had waived the claims by repeatedly\n\naffirming the contract. The district court denied the motion. See City of Fort\n\nCollins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-MEH, 2023 WL 3585214,\n\nat *1, *13 (D. Colo. May 22, 2023). Open then asked the court to require the\n\nCity to elect a remedy before trial\u2014either affirming the contract and receiving\n\ndamages or rescinding the contract and receiving restitution. But the court\n\ndecided that the City would not have to select a remedy until the jury returned a\n\nverdict on the tort claims. City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-\n\nCV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2023 WL 11868279, at *2, *4 (D. Colo. Sept. 27, 2023).\n\nIf the City elected damages, the jury would be instructed on the breach-of-\n\ncontract claims and counterclaims; if the City elected rescission, the jury would\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 7\n\nbe dismissed, and the court would hold a bench trial on rescission and\n\nrestitution.\n\nThe trial started on October 23, 2023, and lasted ten days. At the close of\n\nevidence, Open moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the breach-of-contract claim and the tort claims.\n\nThe court denied the motion. Then the court gave the jury \u201call of the general\n\nclosing instructions,\u201d but only the fraud and negligent-misrepresentation\n\n\u201cclaim-specific instructions.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 58\u201359. For each of the tort claims,\n\nthe verdict form asked whether the City had proved the claim against \u201cOpen\u201d\n\nand whether \u201cOpen\u201d had proved waiver or expiration of the statute of\n\nlimitations. App. vol. 6, at 4\u20136. The district court instructed the jury to find\n\nwaiver if:\n\n1. The City learned the actual or true facts after it began the project\n with Open, but before it ceased the project with Open; and\n 2. The City continued the project with Open with full knowledge of\n the actual facts when a reasonable person under the same or similar\n circumstances would not have done so.\nApp. vol. 5, at 165. Open objected to the City\u2019s request that the instruction\n\nspecify, \u201cfull knowledge of all the actual facts,\u201d but it did not otherwise object\n\nto the waiver instruction. App. vol. 15, at 7 (emphasis added).\n\nThe jury determined that the City had proved fraudulent inducement and\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, but that the City had waived the negligent-\n\nmisrepresentation claim. The City elected to rescind the contract, so the court\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 8\n\ndismissed the jury. And because the City elected to rescind the contract, Open\u2019s\n\ncounterclaim for breach of contract disappeared.\n\nOpen timely renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nRule 50(b). And as part of its rescission brief, it also moved under Rule 52(c)\n\nfor partial judgment, arguing (1) that the City\u2019s evidence did not support a\n\nrestitution award and (2) that the City had waived rescission as a remedy. 3 The\n\ncourt denied the Rule 52(c) motion, City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No.\n\n1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *11\u201312 (D. Colo. Mar. 21,\n\n2024), and entered judgment against \u201cOpen\u201d for just under $20 million. Open\n\nagain moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and moved\n\nunder Rule 52(b) for amended or additional findings and Rules 59(a) and (e) for\n\namendment of the judgment or a new trial. The court orally denied those\n\nmotions and the earlier Rule 50(b) motion. Open timely appealed, and we have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 4\n The district court correctly noted that Rule 52 is reserved for nonjury\ntrials, but nonetheless addressed Open\u2019s arguments \u201cin the hopes of obviating\nthe need to address the[] matters in the future[.]\u201d City of Fort Collins v.

Mar. 21, 2024).\n The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\nOpen International and Open Investments are both Florida limited liability\ncompanies and their members are all Florida citizens. And Fort Collins is a city\nin Colorado, so it is a Colorado citizen. See App. vol. 3, at 47 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20135.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 9\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOpen presents four arguments on appeal: (1) that Colorado\u2019s economic-\n\nloss rule and the parties\u2019 contract bar the City\u2019s tort claims; (2) that insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of fraud; (3) that the City waived its\n\nability to rescind the contract; and (4) that Open Investments cannot be held\n\nliable for the rescission award.\n\nI. Tort Claims Not Barred\n\nFirst, Open asserts that the district court erred by denying its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, which argued that the City\u2019s tort claims were\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule and the parties\u2019 contract.\n\n\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d Fresquez v.\n\nBNSF Ry. Co., 52 F.4th 1280, 1295 (10th Cir. 2022). In reviewing the denial of\n\nsuch a motion, \u201cwe draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty,\u201d and we reverse \u201conly if the evidence points but one way and is\n\nsusceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the nonmovant.\u201d Id.\n\nA. Colorado\u2019s Economic-Loss Rule\n\n\u201cUnder the economic loss rule, a party suffering only economic loss from\n\nthe breach of an express or implied contractual duty may not assert a tort claim\n\nfor such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.\u201d Mid-\n\nCentury Ins. Co. v. HIVE Constr., Inc., 567 P.3d 153, 158 (Colo. 2025)\n\n(citation modified). Though it is termed the \u201ceconomic loss rule,\u201d a \u201cmore\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 10\n\naccurate designation . . . would be the \u2018independent duty rule\u2019\u201d because the\n\n\u201ckey to determining the availability of a contract or tort action lies in\n\ndetermining the source of the duty that forms the basis of the action.\u201d Town of\n\nAlma v. AZCO Constr., Inc., 10 P.3d 1256, 1262 & n.8 (Colo. 2000).\n\nTo determine whether a tort duty arises independent of a contract,\n\nColorado courts ask: \u201c(1) whether the relief sought in [tort] is the same as the\n\ncontractual relief; (2) whether there is a recognized common law duty of care in\n\n[tort]; and (3) whether the [tort] duty differs in any way from the contractual\n\nduty.\u201d 5 BRW, Inc. v. Dufficy & Sons, Inc., 99 P.3d 66, 74 (Colo. 2004). After\n\nexamining each factor, we conclude that the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by\n\nthe economic-loss rule.\n\nFirst, the City is seeking the same relief in tort that it is seeking under\n\nthe contract. In its complaint, the City sought rescission for both the tort and\n\ncontract claims, and alternatively sought damages for its contract claim. App.\n Though the Colorado Supreme Court has never held as much, dicta in\nColorado cases suggest that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not apply\nto intentional tort claims.\u201d Mid-Century Ins. Co., 567 P.3d at 156\u201357; see, e.g.,\nUnited Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1226 (10th\nCir. 2000) (\u201cIt is settled in Colorado that the economic loss rule applies only to\ntort claims based on negligence[.]\u201d); Bermel v. BlueRadios, Inc., 440 P.3d\n1150, 1153, 1154 n.6 (Colo. 2019) (observing that previous cases had applied\nthe economic-loss rule \u201cto bar only certain common law negligence claims\u201d and\nstating that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not be available to shield\nintentional tortfeasors from liability for misconduct that happens also to breach\na contractual obligation\u201d); Town of Alma, 10 P.3d at 1263 (citing Brody v.\nBock, 897 P.2d 769, 776 (Colo. 1995), a case that involved a common-law\nfraud claim, as an example of a common-law tort that is independent of a\nbreach-of-contract claim).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 11\n\nvol. 3, at 62 \u00b6 79 (rescission for tort claim), 64 \u00b6 89 (rescission for contract\n\nclaim, alternatively damages); see also id. at 47 \u00b6 2. So this factor supports\n\nOpen\u2019s view that the economic-loss rule bars the City\u2019s tort claims. See Dream\n\nFinders Homes LLC v. Weyerhaeuser NR Co., 506 P.3d 108, 121 (Colo. App.\n\n2021).\n\nSecond, because fraudulent inducement is a common-law tort claim,\n\n\u201cthere is a recognized common law duty of care in [tort.]\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74;\n\nsee also Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., 373 P.3d 603, 607 (Colo. 2016).\n\nSo this factor supports the City.\n\nThird, and most critically, \u201cthe [tort] duty differs . . . from the\n\ncontractual duty.\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74. Open claims that the parties\u2019 contract\n\n\u201cset[s] out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is based\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cthe grades Open assigned to thousands of software functionalities in its\n\nresponse to the City\u2019s RFP, and the City\u2019s claim that some of the delivered\n\nfunctionalities were inferior to those representations.\u201d Op. Br. at 25\u201326. So\n\nbecause the contract incorporated those grades and provided the requirements\n\nfor Open\u2019s software service, Open concludes that the contract subsumes the\n\nCity\u2019s fraud claim. We disagree.\n\nTorts based on precontractual conduct are often found to be independent\n\nof the contract. In re Bloom, 622 B.R. 366, 429 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2020)\n\n(collecting cases). For example, in Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., the\n\nColorado Supreme Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 12\n\nhad \u201cwrongfully induced him into entering a contractual relationship knowing\n\nthat it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised [services]\u201d\n\nestablished \u201ca violation of a tort duty that is independent of the contract.\u201d 373\n\nP.3d at 607. The court explained that \u201c[t]here is an important distinction\n\nbetween failure to perform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party\n\nto enter a contract in the first place.\u201d Id. It said that the \u201ccritical question\u201d was\n\nnot whether the tort claims were \u201crelated to the promises that eventually formed\n\nthe basis of the contract,\u201d but \u201cwhether the tort claims flow[ed] from an\n\nindependent duty under tort law.\u201d Id.; cf. Keller v. A.O. Smith Harvestore\n\nProds., Inc., 819 P.2d 69, 73 (Colo. 1991) (\u201c[C]laims of negligent\n\nmisrepresentation are based not on principles of contractual obligation but on\n\nprinciples of duty and reasonable conduct.\u201d).\n\nVan Rees is on point with our case. There, the parties contracted for web-\n\nrelated services and the development of new websites. 373 P.3d at 605. The\n\ncontract specified what services were to be provided and when. Id. Like our\n\ncase, the defendant \u201cmissed deadlines and failed to deliver the promised\n\nservices.\u201d Id. That was the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Id.\n\nBut during contract negotiations, the defendant allegedly \u201cknew that it lacked\n\nsufficient staff to complete the website on time, and did not intend to provide\n\nthe [full services],\u201d so it induced the plaintiff into a contractual relationship\n\n\u201cknowing that it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised\n\nweb-related services.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. Like our case, the defendant\u2019s\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 13\n\nmisrepresentation about its capabilities formed the basis for the tort claim. Id.\n\nat 607. And that claim was \u201can independent duty that did not arise from the\n\ncontracts,\u201d so it was \u201cnot barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. The\n\nsame is true here. 6\n\nNotwithstanding Van Rees, Open asserts that the City\u2019s claims are still\n\nbarred because the contract memorialized all precontractual representations,\n\nwhich means that the contract subsumed any tort duty. See BRW, 99 P.3d at 74\n\n(\u201cIf we conclude that the duty of care owed by [the defendants] was\n\nmemorialized in the contracts, it follows that the plaintiff has not shown any\n\nduty independent of the interrelated contracts[.]\u201d). But none of Open\u2019s cited\n\ncases involve precontractual representations. See id. at 75 (distinguishing its\n\nfacts\u2014a misrepresentation \u201cduring performance\u201d of the contract\u2014from cases\n\ninvolving misrepresentations \u201cprior to the execution of an agreement\u201d (citation\n\nmodified)); Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 123 (finding no independent duty\n Open criticizes Van Rees\u2019s distinction between a failure to perform the\ncontract and promises that induce a party to enter a contract. Reply Br. at 15\u2013\n16. It relies on HealthBanc Int\u2019l, LLC v. Synergy Worldwide, Inc., a Utah\nSupreme Court decision in which the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to\nadopt a blanket rule that fraudulent inducement is \u201cnecessarily independent of\nthe contract\u201d and instead held that a fraudulent-inducement claim that \u201coverlaps\ncompletely\u201d with a breach-of-contract claim is barred by the economic-loss\nrule. 435 P.3d 193, 196\u201397 (Utah 2018). The court criticized the Colorado\nSupreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Van Rees, calling its distinction between\nperformance and inducement \u201cillusory\u201d when \u201cthe subject matter of the\ninducing promises [is] later negotiated for and included in the contract.\u201d Id. at\n197. But whatever the merits of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning,\nHealthBanc is not binding here because the parties\u2019 contract is governed by\nColorado law, not Utah law. So Van Rees still controls.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 14\n\nbecause the relevant \u201cconduct occurred after the parties entered into the\n\ncontract\u201d). The closest Open gets is Smart v. Stropas, which involved a seller\u2019s\n\nprecontractual nondisclosure of latent defects in the home. No. 24CA0614,\n\n2025 WL 274726, at *2\u20133 (Colo. App. Jan. 23, 2025) (unpublished). There,\n\nthough the intermediate-appellate court found that the economic-loss rule\n\nbarred the home-buyer\u2019s fraudulent-nondisclosure claim, the contract\n\nprovisions exactly tracked the alleged tort duty. Id. at *3. The parties\u2019 contract\n\nboth (1) required the sellers to disclose any knowledge of methamphetamine\n\nbeing \u201cmanufactured, processed, cooked, disposed of, used or stored at the\n\nProperty\u201d and (2) represented that the sellers had no knowledge of such\n\nmethamphetamine use. Id. at *1. So the tort duty to disclose latent defects\n\n(here, the methamphetamine use) did not \u201cdiffer[] in any way from the\n\ncontractual duty\u201d to disclose methamphetamine use. Id. at *4 (citation\n\nmodified). \u201cBecause the contract explicitly addressed the sellers\u2019 obligation to\n\ndisclose methamphetamine,\u201d the tort duty was subsumed by the contract and\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule. Id. at *3.\n\nThe same is not true for our case; the parties\u2019 contract warranted only the\n\nquality of Open International\u2019s performance, not the accuracy of Open\u2019s\n\nrepresentations about its capabilities. Though Open claims that the parties\u2019\n\ncontract \u201cset out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is\n\nbased\u201d\u2014to deliver software functionalities consistent with the representations\n\nin the contract, Op. Br. at 25\u2014we agree with the City that Open conflates \u201cits\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 15\n\nultimate failures to provide and deliver the software functionalities in breach of\n\nits contractual obligations\u201d with its \u201cfraudulent representations about its\n\nsoftware which induced the City into\u201d the contract, Resp. Br. at 29\u201330. See Van\n\nRees, 373 P.3d at 607 (\u201cThere is an important distinction between failure to\n\nperform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party to enter into a\n\ncontract in the first place.\u201d); see also Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 120 (\u201cThe\n\neconomic loss rule does not apply to claims arising from a defendant\u2019s pre-\n\ncontractual conduct because, at that time, there was no contract that could have\n\nsubsumed identical tort duties.\u201d). Like the plaintiff in Van Rees, the City\u2019s \u201ctort\n\nclaims are based on misrepresentations made prior to the formation of the\n\ncontracts,\u201d which fraudulently induced it to enter the contract \u201cand therefore\n\nviolated an independent duty in tort to refrain from such conduct.\u201d 373 P.3d at\n\n607. So applying Van Rees, the third factor supports the City and finding that\n\n\u201cthe claims are not barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id.\n\nAs a final argument, Open claims that the economic-loss rule bars the\n\nCity\u2019s claims because the City is recovering a remedy that is expressly\n\nexcluded under the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 125\n\n(\u201cSophisticated commercial entities . . . may not circumvent the exclusion of\n\ndamages in their contracts by cloaking their claims in tort theories.\u201d). The\n\ncontract states that \u201cOpen\u2019s entire liability\u201d for breaching any of the warranties\n\n\u201cwill be for Open to correct or reperform any nonconforming [s]ervices[.]\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 7 \u00b6 2.1. And though the limitations-of-liability provision\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 16\n\ncontemplates damages and limits the type and amount of damages that can be\n\nrecovered, recovery of damages is limited to (1) indemnification claims,\n\n(2) intentional breaches of the confidentiality and personally-identifiable-\n\ninformation provisions, and (3) unauthorized use of Open\u2019s intellectual\n\nproperty. See id. at 12\u201313 \u00b6\u00b6 12.1\u201312.2. Yet the City sought rescission and\n\nalternatively damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nBut Open doesn\u2019t cite any Colorado Supreme Court case that supports\n\nthat this is a relevant consideration for determining whether a tort duty is\n\nindependent of a contract. And the cases that Open does cite all involve tort\n\nduties that were subsumed by the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at\n\n123\u201325 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cduty to not make misrepresentations\n\nor engage in fraud after they entered into the contract\u201d was \u201csubsumed within\n\nthe contract through the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d and then\n\nobserving that the claimants sought to recover \u201cthe very category of damages\u201d\n\nthat was barred by the contract); RE/MAX, LLC v. Quicken Loans Inc., 295 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 1163, 1170 (D. Colo. 2018) (\u201c[T]o the extent that Quicken Loans\n\nalleges misrepresentations by RE/MAX that are memorialized in the [contract],\n\nthe parties allocated risk with respect to those obligations by contract, and tort\n\nclaims based on those obligations are barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)). So though the City seeks to recover a type of relief that the\n\ncontract prohibits, the conduct warranting the relief is independent of, and\n\ntherefore not governed by, the contract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 17\n\nThus, under Colorado law, the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by the\n\neconomic-loss rule.\n\nB. Merger Clause and Other Provisions\n\nOpen also contends that the contract\u2019s merger clause and limited-\n\nwarranty provisions bar the City\u2019s tort claims.\n\nThough a merger clause \u201climit[s] future contractual disputes to issues . . .\n\nexpressly set forth in the executed document,\u201d misrepresentation claims \u201care\n\nbased not on principles of contractual obligation but on principles of duty and\n\nreasonable conduct.\u201d Keller, 819 P.2d at 72\u201373. So the \u201cmere presence of a\n\ngeneral integration clause in an agreement does not bar a claim for negligent or\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Id. at 73. Instead, to \u201ceffect a waiver of a claim\n\nof negligent [or fraudulent] misrepresentation,\u201d the merger clause must\n\n\u201cspecifically prohibit[]\u201d the claim. Id.\n\nOpen asserts that the contract\u2019s merger clause bars the City\u2019s tort claims\n\nbecause it \u201cwas quite specific with its integration of Open\u2019s RFP response into\n\nthe contract and the parties\u2019 disclaimer of extracontractual representations and\n\npromises.\u201d Op. Br. at 23. But the merger clause says nothing about precluding\n\nclaims for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation. See App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15. Though Open is correct that the clause covers the SOW and\n\nfunctionality matrix, the inclusion of those documents \u201cdoes not specifically\n\npreclude\u201d a fraud claim. Keller, 819 P.2d at 73. So the mere fact of a merger\n\nclause \u201cdoes not effect a waiver of [the tort] claim.\u201d Id. And unlike Steak n\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 18\n\nShake Enterprises, Inc. v. Globex Co., LLC, in which the court found that a\n\nmerger clause precluded a fraudulent-inducement claim because it disproved\n\nreliance \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d 110 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1083 (D. Colo. 2015), the\n\nmerger clause here says nothing about reliance. Compare App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15, with Steak n Shake, 110 F. Supp. 3d at 1083 (merger clause stating that\n\nthe \u201cFranchisees were entering into the agreement as a result of their own\n\ninvestigation and not as a result of any representation by Plaintiffs\u201d); see also\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 6 (contract introduction stating that \u201cthe City has proceeded\n\nwith reasonable reliance on Open\u2019s representations\u201d). So the merger clause\n\ndoes not bar the City\u2019s tort claim.\n\nOpen also asserts that the contract\u2019s limited-warranty provisions bar a\n\ntort claim because they \u201cexpressly disclaim[] reliance on precontractual\n\nrepresentations[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 24. Even if that were true (it\u2019s not), Open has\n\nwaived this argument by presenting it for the first time on appeal. 7 See\n Open claims it preserved this argument by \u201cma[king] a cogent and\ncomplete argument . . . discussing the complete and specific integration of the\nfunctionality matrix [and the] specific merger clause\u201d in its post-trial and\nsummary judgment motions, and that circuit precedent does not \u201crequire a\nlisting of every piece of evidence supporting an argument.\u201d Reply Br. at 17\u201318\n(citing Perez v. El Tequila, LLC, 847 F.3d 1247, 1256 (10th Cir. 2017)). But\nOpen misreads Perez. In Perez, we determined that the appellant had preserved\nits issues on appeal because the \u201cRule 50(a) motions contained identical\narguments\u201d as the Rule 50(b) motion. 847 F.3d at 1255\u201356 (emphasis added).\nThough the Rule 50(b) motion \u201cdid not rely upon the exact same facts\u201d as the\nearlier motions, we noted that such \u201ctechnical precision [was] unnecessary.\u201d Id.\n(emphasis added) (citation modified). But here, Open didn\u2019t simply fail to\ninclude certain facts\u2014it failed to include the argument itself.

Sufficient Evidence of Fraud\n\nSecond, Open asserts that we should reverse the jury\u2019s verdict because\n\n\u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence of an actual and actionable material\n\nmisrepresentation.\u201d Op.

The motions did not mention the limited-warranty\nprovisions.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 20\n\n\u201cBecause the jury has the exclusive function of appraising credibility,\n\ndetermining the weight to be given to the testimony, drawing inferences from\n\nthe facts established, resolving conflicts in the evidence, and reaching ultimate\n\nconclusions of fact, this standard of review is quite deferential to the jury\u2019s\n\nverdict.\u201d Knowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183\u201384 (citation modified).\n\nAt trial, the City alleged three misrepresentations: (1) the projected\n\ntiming for deliveries, (2) the statement in the RFP response that Version 8 of\n\nthe software had been released in 2017, and (3) Open\u2019s grading of the\n\nfunctionality matrix and its use of a software portal other than its homegrown\n\nportal. Because the parties and the district court focus on mainly the third\n\nmisrepresentation, and because we conclude that there is sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting that the third misrepresentation was fraudulent, we do not discuss\n\nthe other alleged misrepresentations.\n\nA. The Functionality Matrix\n\nThe City contends that \u201c[t]he most striking example of Open\u2019s false\n\nrepresentation was its fraudulent grading of its software in response to the\n\nCity\u2019s RFP in March 2018.\u201d Resp. Br. at 15. In Open\u2019s RFP response, Open\n\ngraded 89.7% of the required functionalities as \u201cA,\u201d or as already existing in\n\nthe current software system. But trial evidence showed that Open had internally\n\ngraded only 59.4% of its functionalities as the equivalent of an \u201cA.\u201d And\n\nbecause the internal grading was never disclosed to the City, the City claims\n\nthat Open\u2019s RFP response fraudulently represented its functionalities.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 21\n\nOpen claims that it accurately graded its functionalities based on the\n\nRFP\u2019s requirements. Below are the RFP\u2019s requirements for an \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d\n\ngrade:\n\nApp. vol. 2, at 3. Open asserts (1) that \u201cunrefuted trial testimony\u201d showed that\n\nOpen\u2019s grading was consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions and (2) that its\n\ninternal assessment cannot sustain the City\u2019s fraud claim because it \u201csorted the\n\nfunctionalities using different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a\n\ndifferent type of internal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39.\n\nAt trial, Open International\u2019s president explained that Open\u2019s grading\n\nwas consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions because the instructions asked about\n\nfunctionalities in Open International\u2019s base code, not functionalities in a\n\nreleased version of the software. App. vol. 12, at 184\u201385, 189\u201395. And because\n\nan \u201cA\u201d grade meant that the \u201c[d]esired functionality is achieved through\n\nconfiguration,\u201d even an \u201cA\u201d grade required some level of additional work. App.\n\nvol. 2, at 3; App. vol. 12, at 192\u201393; see also App. vol. 11, at 42 (the City\u2019s\n\nthird-party consultant testifying that \u201cconfiguration\u201d involves \u201cfive-plus\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 22\n\nthings\u201d). Open claims that the City\u2019s expert witness corroborated this testimony\n\nby agreeing that Open could grade a functionality as an \u201cA\u201d if that\n\nfunctionality was present in an earlier version of the software (but not the\n\nunreleased Version 8) so long as Open stated that the functionality was in an\n\nearlier version. See App. vol. 11, at 133\u201334. So Open concludes that the\n\nrepresentations were true and cannot support a finding of fraud.\n\nOpen also contends that its internal assessment \u201csorted the functionalities\n\nusing different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a different type of\n\ninternal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39. Below is a summary table of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment:\n\nApp. vol. 22, at 16. At trial, the City argued that the internal assessment\n\nshowed that only 59.4% of the functionalities (the \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d\n\ncategory) should have been given an \u201cA\u201d grade. But Open contends that its\n\ninternal assessment \u201cmerely broke down the RFP\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 grade into two\n\nsubcategories\u201d: \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d and \u201c[p]lanned for 2018.\u201d Reply Br.\n\nat 10. Open International\u2019s president testified that both categories had the\n\nrequired existing base code, but that the functionalities in the \u201c[c]urrent\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 23\n\nfunctionalities\u201d category were already integrated into Version 8 while the\n\nfunctionalities in the \u201c[p]lanned for 2018\u201d category would be integrated later in\n\n2018. App. vol. 12, at 191; see also id. at 194\u201395 (testifying that three of the\n\nfive categories corresponded with an \u201cA\u201d grade, one of the categories\n\ncorresponded with a \u201cB\u201d grade, and one of the categories corresponded with\n\nmultiple grades). Open acknowledges that the City \u201ctried to impeach\u201d its\n\nwitness on this subject but claims that \u201cnothing contradicted his testimony.\u201d\n\nOp. Br. at 40.\n\nBut Open\u2019s testimony was not unrefuted. On cross-examination, the City\n\nshowed the president\u2019s lack of knowledge about the internal document. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 29, 31. The president\u2019s deposition testimony differed from his\n\ntrial testimony, and the district court instructed the jury on inconsistent\n\nstatements after the jury asked for guidance. See id. at 261 (\u201cI heard a lot of in-\n\nperson testimony today that was inconsistent with recorded deposition. What\n\nare your instructions for us, the jury, how to deal with that?\u201d). It was the jury\u2019s\n\nrole to \u201cgive [the testimony] such credibility as [it] may think it deserves.\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 14, at 5. Also, the City presented evidence that \u201c[i]ndustry standard is\n\nto provide factual and accurate responses of [the vendor\u2019s] product or solution .\n\n. . at the time of response.\u201d App. vol. 11, at 84 (emphasis added). So we agree\n\nwith the district court that there was a \u201cdispute about what is A [grade] versus\n\nwhat [is] B [grade]\u201d and that it was \u201ccompletely a jury decision to conclude\n\nwhether [Open] was making those representations as to a current fact or a fact\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 24\n\nin effect at the time the product went live[.]\u201d Resp\u2019t Add. at 13. The jury made\n\nits decision and \u201c[w]e do not retry issues, second guess the jury\u2019s decision-\n\nmaking, or assess the credibility of witnesses and determine the weight to be\n\ngiven their testimony.\u201d Stroup v. United Airlines Inc., 26 F.4th 1147, 1157\n\n(10th Cir. 2022) (citation modified).\n\nOpen also asserts that the grades given to the various functionalities in\n\nthe functionality matrix are not actionable misrepresentations because the\n\nparties\u2019 contract stated that the criteria for the matrix and RFP response were\n\n\u201copen to interpretation\u201d and fraud claims cannot \u201crest on articulations of\n\nopinion or belief.\u201d Op. Br. at 38, 41. But Open did not present this argument in\n\nthe district court. See App. vol. 5, at 122\u201324 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (asserting\n\nthat the City had not proven a misrepresentation because \u201cthe functional matrix\n\ninstructions required those functionalities to be delivered at go-live,\u201d not at the\n\ntime Open submitted its RFP response); App. vol. 6, at 147\u201348 (Rule 50(b)\n\nMotion) (\u201cNothing in the RFP requested a vendor to grade its then-existing\n\nsoftware[.]\u201d). So it is waived. See Knowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183.\n\nGiven the conflicting testimony about Open\u2019s internal assessment and its\n\nRFP response, the jury had sufficient evidence to find that Open fraudulently\n\nrepresented its functionalities.\n\nB. Grading a Different Portal\n\nThe City also asserts that the jury could have found fraudulent\n\ninducement because of what Open graded. Despite allegedly knowing on March\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 25\n\n1, 2018, that it planned to stop developing its homegrown portal and instead\n\nuse the Milestone portal, Open still graded its homegrown portal for the RFP\n\nresponse. Open argues that this cannot support a fraud claim because the City\n\nadmitted at trial that it knew before signing the contract that Open International\n\nplanned to use the Milestone portal and because the City had described an early\n\ndemonstration of the portal as being \u201cexactly as expected when we selected\n\nOpen Smartflex.\u201d App. vol. 18, at 177; see also App. vol. 9, at 88\u201389; App. vol.\n\n12, at 196\u201397. Though the City knew that Open International was using the\n\nMilestone portal for the contract, Open International\u2019s president agreed at trial\n\nthat \u201c[n]o one at Open told the City [that Open] did not grade the Milestone\n\nportal in the RFP response[.]\u201d App. vol. 13, at 254\u201355. Again, because there\n\nwas conflicting testimony on this issue, we defer to the jury\u2019s finding. See\n\nKnowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183\u201384 (\u201c[T]he jury has the exclusive function of . . .\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, and reaching ultimate conclusions of\n\nfact[.]\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict finding Open liable\n\nfor fraudulent inducement.\n\nIII. Ability to Rescind\n\nThird, Open asserts that because the City knew of multiple problems with\n\nthe software and its implementation by spring 2020, yet continued to affirm the\n\ncontract, the City waived its right to rescind the contract.\n\n\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable time, but what\n\nconstitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a particular case and\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 26\n\nmust be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d Ralston Oil & Gas Co. v. July Corp.,\n\n719 P.2d 334, 340 (Colo. App. 1985). We review \u201cfindings of fact for clear\n\nerror.\u201d Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 826 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nA \u201cfinding of fact is not clearly erroneous unless it is without factual support in\n\nthe record, or if the appellate court, after reviewing all the evidence, is left with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Mile High\n\nIndus. v. Cohen, 222 F.3d 845, 854 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation modified).\n\nA. The Waiver Rule\n\nThe district court instructed the jury to find that Open proved \u201cthe\n\naffirmative defense of waiver\u201d if the City \u201ccontinued the project with Open\n\nwith full knowledge of the actual facts when a reasonable person under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances would not have done so.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 166.\n\nThat instruction is based on Elk River Associates v. Huskin, in which a\n\nColorado appellate court explained that \u201c[t]o sustain the defense of ratification\n\nand waiver, it must appear that the defrauded party, with full knowledge of the\n\ntruth respecting the false representations, elected to continue to carry out the\n\nagreement.\u201d 691 P.2d 1148, 1153 (Colo. App. 1984).\n\nBut Open contends that \u201cthe \u2018full knowledge\u2019 requirement comes into\n\nplay only if one elects to affirm the agreement and thereafter continues to carry\n\nit out and receive its benefits, which would then result in a remedy of damages,\n\nnot rescission.\u201d Op. Br. at 36 (citation modified). Open asserts that to waive\n\nrescission, \u201c[i]t is not requisite that the defrauded party shall be acquainted\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 27\n\nwith all the evidence constituting the fraud[.]\u201d Id. at 35 (quoting Gladden v.\n\nGuyer, 426 P.2d 953, 955 (Colo. 1967)). Instead, rescission is waived once a\n\nparty \u201chas evidence sufficient to reasonably actuate him to rescind the\n\ncontract[.]\u201d Id. (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955). So Open concludes that the\n\njury decided only whether the City had waived its ability to recover damages\n\nfor Open\u2019s fraud, not whether the City had waived its ability to rescind the\n\ncontract. 8\n\nWe disagree. As the district court correctly stated, \u201cColorado courts do\n\nnot treat fraudulent inducement waiver and recission waiver as separate claims,\n\ngoverned by different tests[.]\u201d Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *4;\n\naccord Gerbaz v. Hulsey, 288 P.2d 357, 363 (Colo. 1955) (\u201cIf [it] was actually\n\nthe fact [that the plaintiff misrepresented the contract] then defendant was in a\n\nposition to elect, when he discovered the fact, either to rescind the contract, or\n\nto sue for damages[.]\u201d (emphasis added)); Bankers Tr. Co. v. Int\u2019l Tr. Co., 113\n\nP.2d 656, 664 (Colo. 1941) (\u201c[T]he right to rescind and sue [is] waived\u201d if \u201cthe\n\ndefrauded party, with full knowledge, intentionally condoned the fraud,\n\naffirmed the contract and abandoned all right to recover damages.\u201d). A party\n\nwaives the right to rescind when it has full knowledge of the material fact of\n Open\u2019s argument in the district court was a little different. Rather than\nseparating the waiver rules based on two types of remedies (damages and\nrescission), it separated the waiver rules based on whether the plaintiff was\npursuing a claim or seeking a remedy. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934,\nat *3.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 28\n\nthe fraud, even if it does not know all the underlying details of the fraud. See\n\nTisdel v. Cent. Sav. Bank & Tr. Co., 6 P.2d 912, 917 (Colo. 1931) (finding\n\nwaiver because the defendant had \u201cfull knowledge of the falsity of the\n\nrepresentations, and [] all the material facts respecting the same well in mind\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)); Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955 (\u201cThe duty of rescinding arises\n\nimmediately upon acquiring knowledge of the substantial and material facts\n\nconstituting the fraud\u201d and \u201cno subsequent discovery of cumulative evidence\n\ncan operate to execute waiver of the fraud if one has in the meantime occurred,\n\nor to revise a once lost right of rescission.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation\n\nmodified)); see also In re Mascio, 454 B.R. 146, 151 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2011)\n\n(defining \u201cfull knowledge\u201d as \u201cthe substantial and material facts constituting\n\nthe fraud\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955)). So a party\n\nneed not elect rescission until \u201che becomes aware of facts or circumstances that\n\nentitle him to a rescission.\u201d Young v. Leech, 240 P. 692, 693 (Colo. 1925); see\n\nGerbaz, 288 P.2d at 363 (\u201c[T]he[] defendant was in a position to elect[] when\n\nhe discovered the fact[.]\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\nOpen claims that it makes sense to have separate waiver rules for\n\nrescission and claims for damages because it \u201cprevent[s] a party from waiting\n\nto see how their contract plays out before deciding whether to rescind or sue for\n\ndamages.\u201d Reply Br. at 19\u201320. But Open never explains why \u201cwaiting to see\n\nhow the[] contract plays out\u201d before suing for damages should be treated\n\ndifferently than \u201cwaiting to see how the[] contract plays out\u201d before rescinding.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 29\n\nId. Indeed, the point of waiver is to prevent the \u201cwaiting to see how the[]\n\ncontract plays out\u201d part. See Stoner v. Marshall, 358 P.2d 1021, 1023 (Colo.\n\n1961) (\u201c[The] election [of rescission or damages] must be promptly made . . .\n\notherwise one might, with knowledge of fraud, speculate upon the advantages\n\nor disadvantages of an agreement, receive its benefits, and thereafter repudiate\n\nall its obligations.\u201d (citation modified)). Though Open is correct that many\n\ncases the City and the district court cite involve claims for damages instead of\n\nrescission, it has not persuasively explained why that matters. Regardless of the\n\nremedy, the question is whether the party waived its right to recovery by acting\n\nlike everything was okay under the contract and then turning around and\n\nseeking recovery for the very conduct it chose to ignore.\n\nSo the district court properly instructed the jury on waiver, and we now\n\nconsider whether the finding that the City did not waive its right to rescind the\n\ncontract was clearly erroneous.\n\nB. No Waiver\n\nThe jury found that the City did not waive its right to recover for Open\u2019s\n\nfraudulent inducement. And the district court accepted that factual finding. See\n\nOpen Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *3\u20134. Because this finding has factual\n\nsupport in the record, it was not clearly erroneous. See Cohen, 222 F.3d at 854;\n\ncf. Ralston Oil & Gas Co., 719 P.2d at 340 (holding that the trial court\u2019s\n\nconclusion \u201cthat plaintiff did not unreasonably delay seeking rescission of the\n\ncontract\u201d was \u201camply supported by the record\u201d).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 30\n\nOpen contends that the City knew these facts by spring 2020: (1) that the\n\nsoftware was untested and had not been installed for any other customer,\n\n(2) that the customer portal was not satisfactory and was not the portal\n\nrepresented during the vendor-selection process, (3) that the software\u2019s\n\nfunctionalities were only 58% of the required functionalities, and (4) that there\n\nwere significant issues with Open International\u2019s product. And Open asserts\n\nthat despite this knowledge, the City agreed to PCR 19, which was meant to\n\naddress the issues with the software and deliver complete functionality, and\n\nthus affirmed the contract and waived rescission.\n\nBut Open continues to conflate the problems with its software with its\n\nfraudulent precontractual representations; knowledge of these problems is not\n\nthe same as knowledge of fraud. Though the jury could have inferred\n\nknowledge of fraud based on knowledge of the above facts, it was not required\n\nto do so. The City\u2019s CFO testified that realizing Open\u2019s misrepresentations\n\n\u201cwas a gradual process\u201d and that the \u201cfunctional matrix work was the point in\n\ntime where [the CFO] said I think we may have gotten swindled.\u201d App. vol. 7,\n\nat 108. And there was evidence that the City did not learn of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment of the functionality matrix until discovery. See App. vol. 13, at\n\n254\u201355. So there was at least conflicting evidence about when the City\n\ndiscovered the fraud.\n\nOpen criticizes the City\u2019s CFO\u2019s testimony as \u201cconclusory, self-serving,\n\nand self-contradictory[.]\u201d Reply Br. at 21. But it was the jury\u2019s role to assess\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 31\n\nthe witnesses\u2019 credibility and weigh the evidence. See Bankers Trust Co., 113\n\nP.2d at 664 (\u201c[Q]uestions as to the time when plaintiff first discovered the\n\nfraud . . . are questions of fact for resolution by a jury.\u201d); Ralston Oil & Gas\n\nCo., 719 P.2d at 340 (\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable\n\ntime, but what constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a\n\nparticular case and must be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d).

Open Investments\u2019 Liability\n\nFinally, Open challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion that argued that Open Investments could not be liable for rescission (a\n\ntort remedy) because it was only a guarantor of the contract and thus liable only\n\nfor contract damages. Alternatively, it argued that even if Open Investments\n\ncould be liable for rescission, there was insufficient evidence that Open\n\nInvestments made a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. 9 But we agree\n Open complains that the City \u201ceschewed\u201d its burden to prove each\ndefendant\u2019s liability \u201cby sleight-of-hand, using \u2018Open\u2019 as a trial shorthand to\nrefer to both defendants collectively.\u201d Op. Br. at 42. But in the district court,\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 32\n\nwith the district court that Open has long waived this argument. See Open Int\u2019l,\n\nLLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *5 (\u201c[T]his argument disclaiming any liability of\n\nOpen Investments comes far too late.\u201d).\n\nOpen argued for the first time in its Rule 50(b) motion, one month after\n\nthe jury had been dismissed, that Open Investments could not be held liable for\n\nthe rescission remedy. See App. vol. 17, at 176 (Q: \u201cPrior to your Rule 50[b]\n\nmotion, had this issue ever been brought up?\u201d A: \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t think it\n\nwas brought up until the election of remedies[.]\u201d). Because Open failed to make\n\nthis argument in its Rule 50(a) motion, and because the City objected to this\n\nnew argument, the issue is waived and we will not consider it on appeal. 10 See\n\nall parties consistently referred to Open International and Open Investments\ncollectively as \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cDefendants.\u201d See e.g., Supp. App. vol. 1, at 50\u201385\n(Open\u2019s Partial Motion for Summ.

Open is not just one company, as the\njudge mentioned.\u201d). And Open never objected to the jury instructions or to the\nverdict form that referred to \u201cOpen\u201d collectively.\n Open asserts three reasons why its argument would not be waived.\nFirst, it repeats its earlier argument that \u201ctechnical precision [between Rule\n50(a) and Rule 50(b) motions] is unnecessary[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 43 (quoting Perez,\n847 F.3d at 1256). We reject that argument for the same reason we rejected it\nabove\u2014Open failed to make the argument in its motion. See Perez, 847 F.3d at\n1255\u201356. Second, Open claims that its argument is not waived under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 46, which provides that \u201c[f]ailing to object does not\nprejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was\nmade.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 46. But Open doesn\u2019t assert that it had no opportunity to\nobject; it asserts that \u201cthere was no reason for Open Investments to object[.]\u201d\nOp. Br. at 47 (emphasis added). So Rule 46 does not save Open\u2019s argument.\nThird, Open contends that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(5) preserves\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 33\n\nTherrien v. Target Corp., 617 F.3d 1242, 1250 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010)\n\n(\u201cOrdinarily a party cannot raise in a Rule 50(b) motion an argument not\n\nalready raised in its Rule 50(a) motion. But on appeal we can consider such an\n\nargument when the opposing party failed to object to the Rule 50(b) motion for\n\nraising new arguments.\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the district court\u2019s\n\ndenial of Open\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion on this issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denial of Open\u2019s\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nits claim. But Rule 52(a)(5)\u2019s directive that \u201c[a] party may later question the\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the [court\u2019s] findings, whether or not the\nparty . . . objected to them\u201d is reserved for nonjury trials. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a)(1) (\u201cIn General. In an action tried on the facts without a jury . . . the\ncourt must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law\nseparately.\u201d); see also Johnson v. Raemisch, 779 F. App\u2019x 507, 518 n.10 (10th\nCir. 2019) (\u201cRule 52 governs bench trials[.]\u201d). Though the restitution amount\nwas decided by the court, the issue Open challenges here\u2014its liability\u2014was\ntried before a jury. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *1\u20132. So Rule\n52 offers Open no help either. Open waived its argument.\n\n33"

The Older Americans\nAct (OAA) establishes funding mechanisms and an adminis-\ntrative framework to help states provide healthcare, housing,\nand community services for older persons. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001 et\nseq. States must jump through several hoops before securing\nOAA funding, including submitting a state plan, designating\n\f2 No. 23-2788\n\na state agency, and geographically dividing the state into dis-\ntinct planning and service areas. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027; 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(1). Then, for each service area, states must designate\na \u201cpublic or private nonprofit \u2026 as the area agency.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(2). At the heart of this case is whether those \u201carea\nagencies\u201d can sue to enforce OAA provisions and related Illi-\nnois state laws.\n One such area agency, the Northwestern Illinois Area\nAgency on Aging (NIAAA), filed state and federal suits\nagainst Paula Basta, the former Director of the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA). NIAAA\u2019s lawsuits alleged that Basta,\nin her personal and official capacities, deprived it and others\nof rights guaranteed by Illinois law and the OAA. Specifically,\nthe lawsuits alleged that Basta unlawfully refused to hold\nhearings on three administrative petitions that NIAAA filed.\n Ultimately, NIAAA lost both suits. The Illinois Supreme\nCourt first ruled in Basta\u2019s favor. Then, the federal district\ncourt dismissed NIAAA\u2019s suit on the grounds that it was\ntime-barred and failed to state a claim. After requesting entry\nof a final judgment, NIAAA brought this appeal raising a host\nof issues.\n We find no error and affirm across the board.\n\nI\n\nWe begin with the facts. At the pleadings stage, we accept\nall well-pled facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw\nall reasonable inferences in NIAAA's favor. Gociman v. Loyola\nUniv. of Chicago, 41 F.4th 873, 878 (7th Cir. 2022).\n\fNo. 23-2788 3\n\nA. Administrative Background\n\nAs noted above, the Older Americans Act (OAA) requires\nstates to take certain steps to designate area agencies respon-\nsible for providing services to senior citizens. Should states\nfail to comply with those requirements, the federal govern-\nment can take remedial measures, such as terminating fund-\ning. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027(d). Area agencies, in turn, serve\nas the \u201cpublic advocate[s] for the development or enhance-\nment of comprehensive and coordinated community-based\nsystems of services in each community throughout and spe-\ncific to each planning and service area.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1321.61(a);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3025(b)(5). Area agencies must develop a\nplan to provide services within their designated area and then\nsubmit that plan to state authorities. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3026(a).\n The Illinois Act on Aging designates the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA) as the \u201csingle State agency for receiving\nand disbursing federal funds made available under the \u2018Older\nAmericans Act.\u2019\u201d 20 ILCS 105/4. The IDA is responsible for\ncomplying with the OAA\u2019s provisions and \u201c[a]ssisting area\nagencies on aging in the development of comprehensive and\ncoordinated service delivery systems throughout the State.\u201d\n89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.10(a)(4). NIAAA is one such agency,\nwhich the IDA assigned to cover the state\u2019s nine northwest-\nernmost counties. Although an independent nonprofit,\nNIAAA receives more than ninety percent of its funding from\nthe IDA.\n Previously, Illinois regulations required the IDA to pro-\nvide agencies like NIAAA an opportunity for a hearing when\nthe IDA \u201cpropose[d] to disapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan \u2026 or withdraw from the agency\n\f4 No. 23-2788\n\ndesignation as an [area agency],\u201d when \u201cany eligible appli-\ncant for designation as a planning and service area under the\nprovisions of [the Act]\u201d has been denied, or for \u201cany nutrition\nproject that an area agency proposes to defund.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 215 N.E.3d 935, 948 (Ill. 2022) (citing 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n\u00a7 230.410 amended at 5 Ill. Reg. 3722 (eff. Mar. 31, 1981), re-\nnumbered at 7 Ill. Reg. 5178 (eff. July 27, 1983)). That regula-\ntion was amended effective August 2021. Under the amend-\nment, a hearing is to be provided to an area agency when the\nIDA proposes to: \u201c(A) [d]isapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan that has been submitted to the\n[IDA] by the [area agency]; or (B) [r]eject the [area agency\u2019s]\nrecommendation to designate a service provider.\u201d 89 Ill. Ad-\nmin. Code \u00a7 230.450(a)(1) (\u201c2021 Hearing Rule\u201d). The IDA\nalso has the right to \u201cconduct administrative hearings for\nother appeal requests concerning the health, safety and wel-\nfare of older individuals.\u201d 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.450(b).\n\nB. The Underlying Disputes\n\nIn June 2019, NIAAA requested an administrative hearing\n(\u201cInitial Petition\u201d) with the IDA. The petition presented two\ngrievances and requested findings that the IDA violated the\nIllinois Administrative Procedure Act, 5 ILCS 100/1\u20131 et seq.,\nby withholding funds from it, and that the Department also\nviolated Illinois law.\n The first grievance NIAAA aired in its Initial Petition\nstemmed from the fallout that occurred when NIAAA de-\ncided that the IDA\u2019s Adult Protective Services (APS) Manual\nwas invalid and ought to be recalled. In July 2013, NIAAA\nreached out to the IDA\u2019s then-director, John Holton, raising\nconcerns about the manual. Months later, Holton sent\n\fNo. 23-2788 5\n\nNIAAA a letter advising that the IDA was terminating\nNIAAA\u2019s FY2014 Adult Protective Services (APS) Grant, ef-\nfective January 2014. Fast forward to 2019. In April of that\nyear, the petition alleged, NIAAA\u2019s director and general\ncounsel, Grant Nyhammer, was told by an IDA employee that\nthe employee had been \u201cgiven an order [to] withhold funding\nfrom [NIAAA] to retaliate for [its] advocacy.\u201d Later that\nmonth, as outlined in the petition, Nyhammer asked Basta via\nemail to \u201cinvestigate funding being withheld\u201d from NIAAA.\nBasta responded that she could not speak to practices preced-\ning her tenure as director.\n From this emerged the second grievance NIAAA pre-\nsented in the Initial Petition\u2014that the IDA had refused\nNIAAA\u2019s administrative hearing request. The IDA denied the\nInitial Petition because it did not present a \u201ccontested case\u201d as\ndefined in the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act and\ntherefore did not require a hearing.\n Two months after submitting the Initial Petition, NIAAA\nsubmitted a second petition (\u201cAPS Petition\u201d) in August 2019.\nThe APS Petition raised grievances about events after the fil-\ning of the Initial Petition. This second petition requested a\nhearing and alleged that the IDA had improperly rejected\nNIAAA\u2019s designation of APS providers. As background, two\nmonths earlier, in June, NIAAA had designated APS provid-\ners for its service agency. The next month, the IDA responded\nthat the IDA was \u201cexercising its right to reject the [provider]\nrecommendations\u201d because of \u201cvarious deficiencies in the un-\nderlying [r]equest.\u201d NIAAA\u2019s APS Petition followed, which\nthe IDA denied by letter in September 2019. The letter in-\nformed NIAAA that the IDA \u201cis unable to provide a hearing\n\f6 No. 23-2788\n\nbecause the [APS Petition] fails to present a contested case\nthat would support the right to an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d\n Two years after its first two petitions were denied, NIAAA\nsubmitted a third petition (\u201cState Plan Appeal\u201d). This peti-\ntion, sent in September 2021, alleged that the IDA\u2019s state plan\nfor 2022\u20132024 did not comply with the OAA\u2019s regulations.\nLike the first two petitions, the third petition requested an ad-\nministrative hearing. In December 2021, the IDA responded\nwith a letter dismissing the petition because 89 Ill. Adm. Code\n230.420(d) only permitted area agency appeals in two limited\nand inapplicable circumstances.\n\nC. Court Proceedings\n\nOn November 5, 2019, NIAAA filed a complaint for man-\ndamus in Winnebago County Circuit Court. The state trial\ncourt denied relief, but the state appellate court reversed with\ninstructions for the IDA to conduct hearings on both the Ini-\ntial Petition and APS Petition. In its order remanding the mat-\nter, the appellate court concluded that the IDA\u2019s \u201csummary\ndismissals of [NIAAA\u2019s] petitions and its conclusory state-\nments that the petitions failed to present contested cases were\ninsufficient for meaningful judicial review.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 188 N.E.3d 1283, 1290 (Ill. App. Ct. 2022). The appellate\ncourt also held that the IDA was \u201crequired to give [NIAAA]\nadjudicatory hearings and determine the merits of its peti-\ntions.\u201d Id. at 1292. The case then made its way to the Illinois\nSupreme Court which disagreed with the state appellate court\nand, instead, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing\nthe mandamus complaint. Nyhammer v. Basta, 215 N.E.3d 935\n(Ill. 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 2497 (2023).\n\fNo. 23-2788 7\n\nHaving lost its administrative and state court challenges,\nNIAAA proceeded to federal court. On February 28, 2022,\nNIAAA filed a complaint against Paula Basta in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois. NIAAA pleaded ten causes of action\nagainst Basta in its First Amended Complaint: five in her per-\nsonal capacity (Counts I\u2013V) and five in her official capacity\n(Counts VI\u2013X). The allegations at issue in this appeal are as\nfollows:\n Count I: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s hearing rights under the\n OAA;\n Count II: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s right to function as a public\n advocate as defined by the OAA;\n Count III: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n Initial Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count IV: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n APS Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count V: the IDA\u2019s regulation on hearings (as\n amended and codified under 89 Ill. Admin.\n Code \u00a7 230.410, which the parties refer to as the\n \u201cHearing Rule\u201d) denies NIAAA its right to a\n hearing under the OAA and thereby deprives\n NIAAA of due process.\nCounts I\u2013V were brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Counts VI\u2013\nX involved pendant state law claims. NIAAA sought dam-\nages in excess of $75,000, attorneys\u2019 fees, and declaratory\njudgments that (1) Basta unlawfully failed to provide\n\f8 No. 23-2788\n\nhearings on NIAAA\u2019s three petitions, (2) Basta violated due\nprocess, OAA, and state law rights, and (3) the Hearing Rule\nis invalid under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.\n In response, Basta filed a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). That motion\nalleged that NIAAA had not shown: (A) \u201cany property right\nin an administrative hearing pursuant to due process [or] the\nOlder Americans Act\u201d; (B) a clearly established right that had\nbeen violated to defeat qualified immunity to bar Counts I\u2013V;\n(C) why sovereign immunity would not bar Counts VI\u2013X; (D)\nwhy the statute of limitations would not bar Counts III and\nIV; (E) what standing NIAAA has to bring Counts VII\u2013VIII on\nbehalf of older adults and organizations. After full briefing on\nthat motion, the district court entered an order dismissing\nNIAAA\u2019s complaint without prejudice. The order invited\nNIAAA to file an amended complaint, but NIAAA instead\nfiled a motion for entry of a final judgment. The district court\ngranted that motion, and this appeal followed.\n\nII\n\nWith those facts established, we turn to NIAAA\u2019s chal-\nlenge to the district court order granting the motion to dis-\nmiss. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim. Gociman, 41 F.4th at 881. And we may affirm a dismis-\nsal on any basis supported by the record. Thomas v. Dart, 39\nF.4th 835, 840 (7th Cir. 2022).\n Recall, the district court dismissed all of NIAAA\u2019s federal\nclaims (Counts I\u2013V) for three reasons: (1) the statute of limita-\ntions barred claims arising from the IDA\u2019s denials of\nNIAAA\u2019s Initial Petition and APS Petition; (2) NIAAA lacked\n\fNo. 23-2788 9\n\nany property interest deprived by the IDA without due pro-\ncess; and (3) the OAA provisions at issue did not clearly man-\nifest an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights en-\nforceable by NIAAA via \u00a7 1983. On appeal, NIAAA chal-\nlenges all three reasons. We review each in turn.\n\nA. Statute of Limitations\n\nAs a threshold matter, NIAAA argues that the district\ncourt improperly considered the statute of limitations when\nruling on Basta\u2019s motion to dismiss. Specifically, NIAAA\nclaims that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense\nand therefore must be raised in an answer, not a motion to\ndismiss. That is incorrect. In Talevski ex rel. Talevski, our court\ndid indeed caution that \u201cthe proper way to raise a limitations\ndefense is in the answer, as an affirmative defense.\u201d Talevski\nex rel. Talevski v. Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty., 6 F.4th\n713, 721 (7th Cir. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Health & Hosp. Corp. of\nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023) (emphasis added)\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). But in that very case, we also\nacknowledged two other ways that the defense can be raised:\n(1) in a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(c); or (2) in a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in the rare circumstance where \u201cthe\ncomplaint alone alleges enough facts to eliminate all doubt\nabout timeliness.\u201d Id. Here, there was no factual dispute as to\ntimeliness, only a legal one. The parties do not dispute when\nthe underlying facts occurred, and the timing of those events\nwas adequately alleged in the complaint. Instead, they dis-\npute whether the timing of those events meant that related\nclaims were barred as a matter of law. Thus, the district court\n\f10 No. 23-2788\n\nwas right to consider Basta\u2019s statute of limitations argument\nwhen ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n With this threshold matter settled, we consider whether\nthe statute of limitations legally barred the claims at issue\nhere. We have previously held that \u201csection 1983 claims aris-\ning in Illinois are governed by a two-year statute of limita-\ntions.\u201d Kelly v. City of Chicago, 4 F.3d 509, 511 (7th Cir. 1993).\nIn Kelly, we made three important observations: (1) courts\nlook to the personal injury laws of the state where the injury\noccurred to determine the statute of limitations in a \u00a7 1983\ncase; (2) federal law governs the accrual of claims for these\npurposes; and (3) courts apply the tolling laws of the state\nwhere the injury occurred. Id. These rules and principles\nguide us in answering two questions. We first ask when the\nclaims accrued. We then ask whether the limitations period\nwas tolled.\n As we observed in Kelly, the general standard for the ac-\ncrual question is that \u00a7 1983 claims \u201caccrue when the plaintiff\nknows or should know that his or her constitutional rights\nhave been violated.\u201d Id. (quoting Wilson v. Giesen, 956 F.2d\n738, 740 (7th Cir. 1992)). In this case, the two relevant petition\ndenials were discrete events that both occurred by September\n2019. It is difficult to imagine how NIAAA would not or\nshould not have known of the injuries it suffered as a result of\nthose denials in September 2019. And NIAAA does not pre-\nsent any support for an alternative conclusion. In its appellate\nbriefing, NIAAA does not directly challenge Basta\u2019s argu-\nment about when NIAAA\u2019s claims accrued. Thus, NIAAA\nhas waived any argument that the claims accrued after Sep-\ntember 2019. See Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v.\nMidwest Motor Express, Inc., 181 F.3d 799, 808 (7th Cir. 1999)\n\fNo. 23-2788 11\n\n(\u201cArguments not developed in any meaningful way are\nwaived.\u201d).\n NIAAA does argue, however, that its state court litigation\ntolled the limitations period. Illinois law does not support this\nargument. NIAAA points us to the Illinois continuing tort\ndoctrine, under which the limitations period is \u201ctolled\u201d for\ncontinuing violations. Despite courts occasionally using the\nword \u201ctoll\u201d when applying the doctrine, the Illinois continu-\ning tort doctrine governs only the point at which a claim ac-\ncrues. See Pitts v. City of Kankakee, Ill., 267 F.3d 592, 595 (7th\nCir. 2001) (\u201cThe continuing violation doctrine is \u2026 best char-\nacterized as a doctrine governing the accrual of a claim.\u201d); see\nalso Heard v. Sheahan, 253 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he\ncorrect characterization of the [Illinois] doctrine of continuing\nviolation is that it is a doctrine governing accrual, \u2026 not a toll-\ning doctrine[.]\u201d (citations omitted)); Powell v. City of Danville,\n625 N.E.2d 830, 831 (Ill. 1993) (\u201cThere are situations where the\ntortious conduct is continuing, and the limitations period be-\ngins on the date of the last injury (the date the tortious acts\ncease).\u201d). Thus, NIAAA has not offered, nor have we found,\nany authority to support NIAAA\u2019s position that its state court\nlitigation tolled the statute of limitations for its federal claims.\n For these reasons, we find that the relevant claims accrued\nby September 2019\u2014more than two years before NIAAA filed\nits complaint in federal court in February 2022\u2014and were not\ntolled for any period. Accordingly, we affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s ruling that NIAAA\u2019s claims \u201carising from the denials\nof the Initial Petition and the APS Petition are barred by the\nstatute of limitations.\u201d Nw. Ill. Area Agency on Aging v. Basta,\n3:22-cv-50070, 2023 WL 6057263, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 16, 2023).\n\f12 No. 23-2788\n\nB. Deprivation of Property Rights Without Due Process\n\nAlthough the statute of limitations problem is sufficient to\naffirm the dismissal of NIAAA\u2019s claims about the denial of\nthe Initial and APS Petitions, it does not support dismissal of\nthe State Plan Appeal claims. Therefore, we next consider\nwhether those claims implicate NIAAA\u2019s due process rights.\n NIAAA argues that Illinois state law establishes property\nrights enforceable under \u00a7 1983. But this is hard to square with\nthe fact that Illinois\u2019 highest court determined that Illinois\nstate law does not create such rights, at least regarding the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion. In Nyhammer, the Illinois Supreme Court considered the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion and held:\n Here, NIAAA makes no argument that it has a\n life or liberty interest in the subjects of its peti-\n tions for hearing. Thus, the only potentially ap-\n plicable interest NIAAA could have in the fund-\n ing or service provider designation for which it\n seeks a hearing from the Department is a prop-\n erty interest. However, to have a property inter-\n est, there must be more than a unilateral expec-\n tation of the funding or approval of its service\n provider designations. Rather, NIAAA must\n show a legitimate claim of entitlement to the\n funding or service provider designation for\n which it seeks a hearing.\n Applying these principles to the case at bar, we\n cannot say that NIAAA has a constitutionally\n protected property interest because NIAAA has\n\fNo. 23-2788 13\n\nnot alleged facts explaining how, under objec-\n tively ascertainable criteria set forth in the law\n that limits the Department's discretion in some\n way, it is entitled to the \u201cother funding\u201d or ser-\n vice provider designation approval that it seeks.\n215 N.E.3d at 950 (citations omitted).\n We see no reason why the denial of the hearing requested\nin NIAAA\u2019s State Plan Appeal\u2014which was not before the Il-\nlinois Supreme Court\u2014would have involved property rights\ncreated by state law where the first two denials did not. In its\nbriefing, the NIAAA notes that the third petition cited two\nagency regulations, but those would have also applied to the\nfirst two petitions, as would the Illinois Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. Thus, in accordance with the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Nyhammer, we affirm the district court\u2019s\nholding that NIAAA has failed to plausibly allege a due pro-\ncess violation. See Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Miscevic, 880 F.3d\n927, 934 (7th Cir. 2018) (\u201cWe must defer to a state court\u2019s in-\nterpretation of the state\u2019s statute.\u201d) (cleaned).\n C. The OAA & Section 1983\n\nOn the question of whether the OAA creates rights en-\nforceable under \u00a7 1983, NIAAA asks us to reach the same re-\nsult that the Supreme Court did in Health & Hospital Corp. of\nMarion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023). As we recently\nobserved, the Supreme Court in Talevski provided a twofold\ntest to analyze whether a Spending Clause statute creates a\nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Saint Anthony Hosp. v. White-\nhorn, 132 F.4th 962, 970\u201371 (7th Cir. 2025) (citing Talevski, 599\nU.S. at 180\u2013183); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl.,\n145 S. Ct. 2219, 2229\u201334 (2025) (clarifying the analysis). The\n\f14 No. 23-2788\n\nfirst part of that analysis asks whether Congress \u201cunambigu-\nously conferred individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries\nto which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183\n(cleaned). If we answer that question in the affirmative, then\nthe second part of the Talevski analysis asks whether Congress\nintended to preclude the enforcement of those individual\nrights via \u00a7 1983. Id. at 186.\n Applying that two-part approach in Talevski, the Court\nconcluded that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act\u2019s\n(FNHRA) unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice pro-\nvisions \u201cunambiguously\u201d conferred such rights to nursing\nhome residents. Id. at 184 (citing Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S.\n273, 284 (2002)). The nursing home residents cleared the first\nhurdle because the provisions at issue spoke specifically in\nterms of individual rights. Id. at 184\u201386. And the defendants\ncould not rebut the resulting presumption\u2014that is, that the\nindividual rights Congress created in the FNHRA could be\nenforced via \u00a7 1983\u2014because enforcement under \u00a7 1983 was\ncompatible with the enforcement scheme provided for in the\nFNHRA. Id. at 187\u201391.\n Here, the district court determined that the OAA differs\nfrom the FNHRA in both relevant respects. At the first step of\nthe Talevski analysis, we \u201cemploy traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Here, those tools leave\nus without the necessary conviction that the OAA provisions\nat issue in this case create individual rights enforceable by\nNIAAA. So, we need not reach the second part of the analysis.\n Starting with \u00a7 3027 of the OAA, we conclude that this pro-\nvision does not create an individual right enforceable under\n\u00a7 1983 for three reasons.\n\fNo. 23-2788 15\n\nFirst, the context of \u00a7 3027 militates against this determi-\nnation. Although the OAA speaks to older Americans\u2019 \u201centi-\ntlements\u201d generally, \u00a7 3027 was not enacted to secure those\nentitlements per se, but to regulate federal funding related to\nthose entitlements. An indicator of that purpose, for example,\nis the remedy the section provides for noncompliance. See\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981)\n(\u201c[T]he typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally\nimposed conditions is not a private cause of action for non-\ncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to\nterminate funds to the State.\u201d). Here, that remedy is the ter-\nmination of funds to non-compliant states. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3027(d) (\u201cDiscontinuance of Payments\u201d).\n Second, \u00a7 3027 does not identify area agencies specifically\nor older persons more generally as the benefited class.\nWhereas the FNHRA\u2019s relevant provisions spoke directly to\nnursing home residents\u2019 needs and welfare, \u00a7 3027 speaks\nonly in terms of the states. It deals with giving funds to states,\nwithholding those funds from states, allowing states to appeal\nfindings made by the federal government, the notice afforded\nto states, and the limitations of states\u2019 power.\n Third, no provision of \u00a7 3027 specifically confers rights to\nresidents. Although it requires detailed state plans targeted at\nspecific services, \u00a7 3027 governs neither how those services\nare to be administered nor what individual rights (if any) the\nservices are intended to secure. This differs from the FNHRA\nprovisions at issue in Talevski which required nursing homes\nto protect \u201ctransfer and discharge rights\u201d and \u201cprotect and\npromote the right to be free from any physical or chemical re-\nstraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience\nand not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\u201d\n\f16 No. 23-2788\n\nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (emphasis in original) (cleaned)\n(citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1369r(c)(2)); see also\nMedina, 145 S. Ct. at 2234 (\u201c[T]he statutes at issue in Talevski\nsupply the only reliable yardstick against which to measure\nwhether spending-power legislation confers a privately en-\nforceable right.\u201d). Indeed, there is no mention of individual\n\u201crights,\u201d \u201cprivileges,\u201d \u201cimmunities,\u201d or any similar language,\nin \u00a7 3027.\n As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, \u00a7 1983 per-\nmits plaintiffs \u201cto sue for violations of federal spending-\npower statutes only in \u2018atypical\u2019 situations \u2026.\u201d Medina, 145 S.\nCt. at 2239 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). For the three rea-\nsons discussed above, we are left unconvinced that \u00a7 3027 is\nthe sort of \u201catypical\u201d provision contemplated in Talevski.\n Turning to \u00a7 3026(f)(2) of the OAA, we see no reason to\nengage in the Talevski analysis. This is because, even if the pro-\nvision could be enforced via \u00a7 1983, NIAAA failed to state a\nclaim against Basta. Recall, NIAAA claimed that \u00a7 3026(f)(2)\nrequired the IDA to hold a hearing on the withheld funding\nat issue in the Initial Petition. Yet the defendant, Basta, played\nno role in that affair. As the district court noted, \u201cthere are no\nallegations from which it can plausibly be inferred that [Basta]\never made any decision to withhold OAA funding.\u201d Basta,\n2023 WL 6057263 at *5. In the Initial Petition, NIAAA alleged\nonly that Basta\u2019s predecessor withheld funds without first\ngranting a hearing. So, even if \u00a7 3026(f)(2) does create rights\nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u2014a question that we do not consider\ntoday\u2014NIAAA fails to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.\n\fNo. 23-2788 17\n\nHaving followed the approach set forth in Talevski, we af-\nfirm the district court\u2019s ruling that none of the relevant OAA\nprovisions create a right enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n\nIII\n\nIn conclusion, we find that the district court correctly de-\ncided the due process, \u00a7 1983, and statute of limitations issues\nNIAAA raises, and properly granted the motion to dismiss.\nBecause we affirm on those grounds, we do not reach the\nquestion of qualified immunity. See Hicks v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corr.,\n109 F.4th 895, 900 (7th Cir. 2024).\n The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED."

In the present case, the plaintiff broker contends that it had an exclusive agreement to secure certain financing on behalf of the defendant and that it was entitled to a commission even though it was not the procuring cause of a loan the defendant ultimately obtained. For the reasons that follow, we determine that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the transaction at issue and, therefore, we affirm the order appealed from.</p><p><i>Factual and Procedural Background</i></p>\n<p>In June 2020, the defendant, Aurora Properties, LLC, entered into an agreement with the plaintiff, Angelic Real Estate, LLC, a licensed real estate broker specializing in obtaining financing for commercial properties, for the plaintiff to secure certain financing on the defendant's behalf. The two-page letter agreement dated June 8, 2020 (hereinafter the agreement), stated that the defendant was engaging the plaintiff \"exclusively\" to obtain debt financing for multiple office buildings located in Tennessee. Under the \"scope\" provision of the agreement, the plaintiff was to \"assist [the defendant] in identifying, soliciting proposals from, and negotiating with financing providers for debt for the Properties.\" The scope provision set forth the terms of the defendant's desired loan and further provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p>\"[I]f under this Agreement [the plaintiff] does not secure, on or before June 20, 2020, one or more written quotes or terms sheets from lenders [with the desired terms], this Agreement shall remain in place but shall become non-exclusive with regards to any lenders not already approached and engaged by [the plaintiff]. In such instance, [the plaintiff] shall provide [the defendant] a list of its protected lenders it has gone to for the Properties . . . by the end of the next business day. Should [the plaintiff] subsequent to that date secure such terms with a lender on the [list], or with another [*2]lender who has not already provided a terms sheet to [the defendant], either directly or via another intermediary, the exclusivity clause of this Agreement shall be reinstated.\"</p>\n<p>The term of the agreement was 120 days from June 8, 2020. Pursuant to the agreement, if the defendant came to an agreement on terms for financing, the plaintiff was to be paid a fee at the closing of each funding pursuant to a specified fee scale. The agreement also contained an \"Exclusion\" provision, which stated that the above-referenced fee would not apply to a loan with three specified lenders, including Mountain Commerce Bank (hereinafter MCB), \"provided a terms sheet is signed with one of them on or before June 30, 2020.\"</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2020, the defendant obtained a $16,750,000 loan commitment from MCB. The plaintiff allegedly informed the defendant that if MCB entered into a terms sheet before the expiration of the agreement and after the exclusion period, i.e., June 30, 2020, the plaintiff would be entitled to a fee under the agreement. The defendant subsequently closed on the loan with MCB and did not tender a fee to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>In November 2020, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover the fee allegedly due under the agreement. The plaintiff subsequently moved for summary judgment on the complaint. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that the terms of the agreement were clear and unambiguous and granted the plaintiff the exclusive right to secure debt financing on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff argued that since the agreement was exclusive, it was entitled to a fee as long as the defendant obtained financing during the life of the agreement, regardless of whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the financing. The plaintiff further argued that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB outlined in the agreement, that exclusion period expired on June 30, 2020, nearly two months before the defendant entered into a terms sheet with MCB.</p>\n<p>The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendant contended, among other things, that the agreement contained no clear and express language that a fee was owed regardless of the defendant independently negotiating its own terms. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff therefore was not entitled to a fee in connection with the defendant's loan from MCB, as there was no dispute the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of that loan.</p>\n<p>In an order dated October 11, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's motion and granted the defendant's cross-motion. The court determined, inter alia, that notwithstanding the fact the agreement's exclusion provision expired on June 30, 2020, given the lack of clear exclusivity in the agreement, the plaintiff was not entitled to receive a fee for a loan negotiated and secured solely by the defendant.</p>\n<p>This appeal by the plaintiff ensued.</p><p><i>Legal Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues on appeal, as it did before the Supreme Court, that it is entitled to a fee in connection with the MCB transaction because the agreement with the defendant was exclusive, and a broker is entitled to a commission under an exclusive agreement if a sales transaction occurs during the life of an agreement, whether or not the broker was the procuring cause of the transaction. The plaintiff further argues that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB, the plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to a fee because the loan commitment was obtained from MCB after the end of the exclusion period and before the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement, i.e., October 6, 2020.</p>\n<p>Generally, \"[t]o prevail on a cause of action to recover a commission, the broker must establish (1) that it is duly licensed, (2) that it had a contract, express or implied, with the party to be charged with paying the commission, and (3) that it was the procuring cause of the sale\" (<i>All Is. Estates Realty Corp. v Singh</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 1392</span>, 1392 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Blooming Home Realty, LLC v Infinity Holdings Northeast, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 AD3d 815</span>, 816). Thus, a broker seeking to recover a commission is normally required to make a showing that it was the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 AD3d 793</span>, 797 [involving a real estate brokerage agreement]; <i>Saunders Ventures, Inc. v Catcove Group, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">209 AD3d 893</span>, 896 [same]; <i>Multiloan Mtge.

Asian Gardens Ltd.\">303 AD2d 658, 660</a></span> [involving a mortgage brokerage agreement]). However, there is a distinction between brokerage agreements granting an exclusive agency and those conferring an exclusive right to sell, the latter of which permits a broker to recover a commission even if it was not the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#534\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 536</a></span>). In general, pursuant to an exclusive agency agreement, if the owner finds its own buyer, then no commission is due to the broker (<i>see U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v Hanna</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5989996\"><a href=\"/opinion/6124908/us-no-1-laffey-real-estate-v-hann/#553\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v.

Sanitary Disposal, Inc.\">120 AD2d 915, 916</a></span>). In other words, \"[w]here a broker has been granted an 'exclusive agency,' the seller cannot 'employ another broker,' but 'would not be precluded from itself making the sale without becoming liable to [the broker] for a commission'\" (<i>New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, 216 AD3d at 798, quoting <i>Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v Servinational, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5797685\"><a href=\"/opinion/5939275/hammond-kennedy-co-v-servinational-inc/#397\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v. Servinational, Inc.\">48 AD2d 394, 397</a></span>). In contrast, if a broker has been granted an exclusive right to sell, the broker would be entitled to a commission even if the owner were solely responsible for the sale (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5797685\"><a href=\"/opinion/5939275/hammond-kennedy-co-v-servinational-inc/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v.

UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 535</a></span> [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]), the Court of Appeals held that \"a contract giving rise to an exclusive right of sale must clearly and expressly provide that a commission is due upon sale by the owner or exclude the owner from independently negotiating a sale.\" The Court of Appeals explained that \"[r]equiring an affirmative and unequivocal statement to establish a broker's exclusive right to sell is consistent with the general principle that an owner's freedom to dispose of her own property should not be infringed upon by mere implication\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). In that case, the plaintiff broker had entered into a financial brokerage agreement with the defendant, which the plaintiff conceded lacked a provision expressly conferring an exclusive right of sale (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The plaintiff argued that, despite the absence of such provision, the court should \"examine the contract as a whole to deduce the parties' intent to create an exclusive right to sell or, if the agreement is ambiguous, to examine parol evidence\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The Court of Appeals rejected that approach \"in favor of a rule that, '[w]ithout an unequivocal expression of intent by its own terms or by necessary implication from its terms, the . . . contract is at most considered to create an exclusive agency, not excluding the owner's inherent right to sell his or her own property'\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>, quoting 11 NY Jur 2d, Brokers \u00a7 169).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i> also made clear that the rule requiring a clear statement to confer an exclusive right of sale is not limited to real estate [*4]brokerage agreements. In rejecting the plaintiff's argument seeking to apply such a limitation, the Court of Appeals stated that it saw \"no reason to apply a different rule to brokerage contracts concerning the sale of financial instruments in the investment banking context,\" noting that, \"[i]n both cases, the governing principles arise from the law of agency and contract, not from the law of real property\" (<i>id.</i> at 536).</p>\n<p>The same reasoning has been applied in the context of brokerage agreements to secure financing. For example, in <i>Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i> (<span class=\"citation no-link\">197 AD3d 1057</span>, 1058), the defendant Crosswing Holdings, LLC (hereinafter Crosswing), retained the plaintiff Silvergrove Advisors, LLC (hereinafter Silvergrove), to assist it in obtaining financing. Crosswing obtained an interim bridge loan during the life of the agreement, and Silvergrove contended that it was entitled to a success fee for the bridge loan even though it had not been involved in that transaction (<i>see <span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>). The Appellate Division, First Department, in pertinent part, upheld the determination denying that branch of Silvergrove's motion which was for summary judgment in connection with recovering that success fee, noting that \"the contractual language plainly states that Silvergrove was not given an exclusive right of sale, but was simply made defendants' exclusive broker\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>, citing <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">23 NY3d 528</a></span>).</p>\n<p>In contrast, in <i>Matusik v Ward</i> (<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/#1215\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v. Ward\">68 AD3d 1213, 1215</a></span>), certain defendants had entered into an agreement to obtain financing for a hotel project with a licensed real estate salesperson associated with the plaintiff, which set forth a period of exclusivity during which time the salesperson was entitled to a commission, regardless of whether he or another party procured the financing commitment. Given this language, the Appellate Division, Third Department, held that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of liability on his cause of action to recover a commission pursuant to that agreement even though the parties disputed the extent to which the salesperson was involved in the negotiation of the loan (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v. Ward\">id.</a></span></i>).</p>\n<p>Applying these principles here, the defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the complaint. Initially, it is undisputed that the plaintiff did not secure a lender or loan with conforming terms on behalf of the defendant before June 20, 2020. Further, the defendant demonstrated that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the loan the defendant independently obtained from MCB in August 2020. The agreement did not clearly and expressly provide the plaintiff with the exclusive right to deal or negotiate on the defendant's behalf (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

Hayt, Hayt &amp; Landau\">264 AD2d at 815</a></span>; <i>see also Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i>, 197 AD3d at 1058). The defendant also demonstrated that the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of the loan from MCB (<i>see Alta Capital Partners Intl. LLC v Parsons Cap. LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4222525\"><a href=\"/opinion/4445272/alta-capital-partners-international-llc-v-parsons-capital-llc/#493\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Alta Capital Partners International LLC v.

The plaintiff does not contend that the exclusion provision or any other part of the agreement is ambiguous, but rather, that the clear and unambiguous terms of the agreement entitled the plaintiff to a fee if a terms sheet was issued by MCB after June 30, 2020, but prior to the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement. However, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, nothing in the agreement, either expressly or by necessary implication, obligated the defendant to pay a fee to the plaintiff upon the expiration of the exclusion provision on June 30, 2020 (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from the trial court\u2019s order designating her a\n\nvexatious litigant and denying her statement of inability to pay costs. The appellee who\n\nfiled the motion is Nicholas Denbrock, the father of Andrews\u2019s daughter. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arises from a modification suit Andrews filed pro se on December 18,\n\n2024\u2014just three weeks after the trial court rendered a final order in another modification\n\nsuit on November 26, 2024.2 Over the next two months, Andrews filed sixteen additional\n\nmotions and pleadings. These included multiple emergency motions, amended petitions,\n\nmotions to reconsider, motions to stay, and notices claiming constitutional violations.\n\nAndrews also requested electronic access to the child, moved to declare Denbrock a\n\nvexatious litigant, filed special appearances challenging jurisdiction, and demanded\n\n\u201cimmediate return of child.\u201d\n\nAndrews filed a declaration of inability to pay costs, claiming $0 monthly income,\n\n$8,165 in monthly expenses, $1,800 in assets, and $118,500 in debt.\n\nDenbrock moved to declare Andrews a vexatious litigant based on her numerous\n\nfilings. At the hearing, the trial court asked Andrews to provide documentation supporting\n\nher inability to pay. Andrews initially claimed she received no notice, then stated the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over her. When pressed again, Andrews objected and continued\n\nasserting the court lacked personal jurisdiction.\n\nThe trial court found that Andrews refused to present proof of her financial records\n\nand ordered her to pay court costs. The court granted Denbrock\u2019s vexatious litigant\n\nmotion and required Andrews to post a security bond or face dismissal with prejudice of\n\nher pending motions. The order prohibits Andrews from filing new pleadings for\n\n2 Andrews\u2019s appeal from that decision is In the Interest of E.K.D., No. 07-24-00342-CV, also\nresolved this day.\n\faffirmative relief as a pro se litigant without first obtaining permission from the local\n\nadministrative judge. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.102(a). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI. Jurisdiction\n\nDenbrock contends this Court lacks jurisdiction because the vexatious litigant\n\norder is not final. However, the Third Court of Appeals has held that interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom prefiling orders designating a person as a vexatious litigant are permissible.\n\nSerafine v. Crump, 665 S.W.3d 93, 102 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2023), rev\u2019d on other grounds,\n\n691 S.W.3d 917 (Tex. 2024). Principles of horizontal stare decisis require this Court to\n\nfollow the authority of the Third Court as if we were sitting as that court. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 41.3; Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645 S.W.3d 251, 258 (Tex. 2022). We therefore exercise\n\njurisdiction over Andrews\u2019s appeal.\n\nII. Vexatious Litigant Designation\n\nChapter 11 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code establishes procedures\n\nfor designating vexatious litigants. A court may designate a plaintiff as vexatious if the\n\nplaintiff has either: (1) commenced, prosecuted, or maintained five litigations as a pro se\n\nlitigant in seven years with additional necessary findings; or (2) after a litigation has been\n\nfinally determined against the plaintiff, repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate the\n\nsame issues against the same defendant. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.054(1),\n\n(2).\n\f We review the court\u2019s vexatious litigant determination for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSerafine, 665 S.W.3d at 105. Constitutional claims are reviewed de novo. Fontenot v.\n\nFontenot, 667 S.W.3d 894, 911 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2023, no pet.).\n\nA. Fundamental Parental Rights\n\nAndrews argues the vexatious litigant designation violates her fundamental\n\nparental rights by preventing her from filing motions to protect her child. We addressed\n\nthis argument in Byars v. Evans, concluding that requiring a parent to seek permission\n\nfrom the local administrative judge before filing affirmative pleadings does not violate due\n\nprocess because it is not an absolute denial of parental rights. No. 07-14-00064-CV,\n\n2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 201, at *12\u201314 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Jan. 8, 2016, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). Although the Third Court has not precisely addressed this issue, it has generally\n\nrecognized that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate due process. Caldwell v.\n\nZimmerman, No. 03-18-00168-CV, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Mar. 27, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nAndrews argues that because attorneys have absolute immunity for actions\n\nundertaken while representing clients, parents appearing pro se should have similar\n\nimmunity when acting in their child\u2019s best interest. This argument fails for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the prefiling order does not prohibit Andrews from filing\u2014it requires her to obtain\n\npermission from the local administrative judge before filing new pleadings for affirmative\n\nrelief. Second, Andrews misunderstands attorney immunity. Attorney immunity protects\n\nagainst civil liability to third parties, not against court authority over attorneys. Bethel v.\n\nQuilling, Selander, Lownds, Winslett & Moser, P.C., 595 S.W.3d 651, 657 (Tex. 2020)\n\f(\u201cWe have long recognized . . . that attorney immunity is not boundless.\u201d). Courts retain\n\nfull authority to sanction, hold in contempt, or discipline attorneys for inappropriate\n\nconduct. Brewer v. Lennox Hearth Products, LLC, 601 S.W.3d 704, 718 (Tex. 2020) (\u201cA\n\ncourt\u2019s inherent authority includes the power to discipline an attorney\u2019s behavior.\u201d)\n\n(cleaned up).\n\nAndrews\u2019s first issue is overruled.\n\nFirst Amendment Right to Petition\n\nAndrews\u2019s entire second issue is stated as: \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the\n\nright to petition courts for redress (BE & K Construction Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516\n\n(2002)).\u201d This issue is insufficiently briefed. Nevertheless, the Third Court has previously\n\nheld that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate the First Amendment right to\n\npetition. Caldwell, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136.\n\nAndrews\u2019s second issue is overruled.\n\nStatutory Requirements\n\nBy her third issue, Andrews argues she is not a \u201cplaintiff\u201d under the statute and did\n\nnot file five frivolous cases in seven years. The statute defines \u201cplaintiff\u201d as \u201can individual\n\nwho commences or maintains a litigation pro se.\u201d TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 11.001(5) (emphasis added). Andrews meets both definitions: she commenced a\n\nmodification proceeding, and she maintained litigation through repeated motions to\n\nreconsider, stay enforcement, or declare orders void.\n\f Andrews\u2019s challenge is focused on only one basis for the vexatious litigant\n\nfinding\u2014five frivolous cases in seven years; she ignores the alternative basis that she\n\nrepeatedly attempted to relitigate matters finally determined against her. See id.\n\n\u00a7 11.054(1), (2). In her reply brief, Andrews summarily argues there was no competent\n\nevidence supporting this finding. However, arguments may not be raised for the first time\n\nin a reply brief. See McFadden v. Olesky, 517 S.W.3d 287, 293 n.3 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin\n\n2017, pet. denied).\n\nAndrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nInability to Pay\n\nBy her fourth issue, Andrews argues the trial court erred by denying her statement\n\nof inability to pay costs and failing to enter findings of fact. Andrews contends her affidavit\n\nconclusively established her inability to pay and was not contradicted by other evidence.\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 permits a party to file a sworn statement of\n\ninability to afford court costs. When the statement is contested, the trial court may require\n\nthe declarant to prove inability to pay at an evidentiary hearing with at least ten days of\n\nnotice. TEX. R. CIV. P. 145. At the hearing, \u201cthe burden is on the declarant to prove the\n\ninability to afford costs.\u201d Id.\n\nThe test for indigence is whether the record shows \u201cby a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the applicant would be unable to pay the costs . . . if [s]he really wanted to\n\nand made a good-faith effort to do so.\u201d Higgins v. Randall Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Off., 257 S.W.3d\n\n684, 686 (Tex. 2008) (cleaned up). We review for an abuse of discretion. Henderson v.\n\fArabzadegan, No. 03-24-00313-CV, 2024 Tex. App. LEXIS 5919, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Aug. 16, 2024, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nThe trial court provided Andrews with notice and asked her to bring documentation\n\nsupporting her indigency affidavit. Andrews refused to provide any documentation,\n\ninstead repeatedly asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction. Andrews\u2019s affidavit also\n\ncontained contradictory information: she claimed $0 monthly income and only $1,800 in\n\nassets while reporting $8,000 in monthly expenses. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in requiring Andrews to pay court costs.\n\nAndrews also complains the trial court failed to make findings of fact mandated by\n\nRule 145. See id. R. 145(f)(2). However, the trial court issued its findings seven days\n\nafter Andrews filed her brief, and she made no request to supplement her brief. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.7.\n\nAndrews also makes a conclusory argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling violates the\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. This argument consists of a\n\nsingle quote from a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Missing from the argument is any\n\nanalysis of how the trial court\u2019s ruling, or requiring her to pay court costs, violates her\n\nrights. Accordingly, this argument is waived for inadequate briefing. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex. 2018).\n\nAndrews\u2019s fourth issue is overruled.3\n\n3 In a fifth issue, Andrews challenges what she calls the trial court\u2019s \u201cflawed rulings.\u201d Her argument\ncontains no citations to the record, applicable law, or authority. Andrews fails to identify which specific\nruling she challenges, what relief she seeks, or how any relief could be granted. This issue is waived for\ninadequate briefing. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex.\n\f CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all of Andrews\u2019s issues, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n2018) (\u201cA brief must provide citations or argument and analysis for the contentions and failure to do this\ncan result in waiver.\u201d).\n\n8"

Andrews\n\nraises three issues: (1) the trial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised\n\nvisitation; (2) the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption favoring a standard\n\npossession order; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in determining her net\n\nresources for child support were subject to the maximum amount. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case began with two registered foreign orders from Nevada that gave the\n\nparties \u201cjoint legal custody,\u201d a week-on/week-off possession schedule, and a mutual\n\nbehavior order. Denbrock filed suit to modify the Nevada order in Texas, requesting that\n\nhe have the exclusive right to designate the child\u2019s residence and to make all medical and\n\neducational decisions concerning the child. Andrews counterpetitioned for similar relief.\n\nThe matter was tried to the bench over four trial days across six months. The trial\n\ncourt appointed both parties as joint managing conservators but awarded Denbrock\n\nexclusive rights including the right to designate the child\u2019s residence. Andrews received\n\nonly supervised visitation and was ordered to pay $1,500 monthly in child support.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPossession and Access\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s supervised visitation order in her first two\n\nissues. We review a trial court\u2019s modification of conservatorship or possession for an\n\nabuse of discretion. In re J.A.J., 243 S.W.3d 611, 616 (Tex. 2007). \u201cThe best interest of\n\nthe child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues\n\nof conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d\n\n211, 218 (Tex. 2021) (quoting TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.002). Conservatorship suits\n\nare \u201cintensely fact driven.\u201d Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 19 (Tex. 2002). For this reason,\n\n\u201cthe trial court is in the best position to \u2018observe the demeanor and personalities of the\n\nwitnesses and can \u201cfeel\u201d the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by\n\nmerely reading the record.\u2019\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting Echols v. Olivarez,\n\f85 S.W.3d 475, 477 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2002, no pet.)). The factfinder \u201cis the sole judge\n\nof the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d Golden Eagle\n\nArchery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion by acting \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principles\u201d or arbitrarily or unreasonably. In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting\n\nWorford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam)). A trial court also\n\nabuses its discretion \u201cif it imposes restrictions that exceed those required to protect the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest.\u201d In re H.D.C., 474 S.W.3d 758, 764 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2014, no pet.); see also In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218\u201319.\n\nUnder this standard, challenges to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nare not independent grounds of error but instead are factors used to assess whether the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion. Zeifman v. Michels, 212 S.W.3d 582, 587 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin 2006, pet. denied). An appellate court considers (1) whether the trial court had\n\nsufficient information on which to exercise its discretion and (2) whether the trial court\n\nerred in its application of discretion. Id. at 588. A trial court does not abuse its discretion\n\nif there is some substantive, probative evidence to support its decision. Id. at 587.\n\nAndrews argues that under the Holley and Family Code\u2019s best-interest factors, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised visits. She also challenges the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a standard possession\n\norder. See Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976);2 TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.\n\n2 The Holley factors include: (1) the desires of the child; (2) the emotional and physical needs of\n\nthe child now and in the future; (3) the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future;\n(4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (5) the programs available to assist these\nindividuals to promote the best interest of the child; (6) the plans for the child by the individuals seeking\n\f\u00a7 153.134(a).3 Andrews contends the trial court based its ruling on a \u201cmere failure to\n\nfollow a court order\u201d rather than the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe trial court found Andrews violated court orders approximately two dozen times.\n\nSome violations were relatively minor, such as failing to provide her new address in a\n\ntimely manner. Other violations were more significant, including going out of state,\n\nrefusing to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s periods of possession, and making\n\ndemeaning remarks about Denbrock during electronic communications with the child.\n\nThe trial court also found that Andrews had refused to identify herself at a hearing and\n\nsent ex parte communications to the trial court through social media. Additionally,\n\nAndrews tried to remove the child from Denbrock\u2019s car without permission during what\n\nwas supposed to be supervised visitation. Andrews does not challenge any of these\n\nfindings, and the evidence supports them.\n\nAdditional evidence at trial included various filings by Andrews, including a \u201cWrit of\n\nDivinia,\u201d and a notice that Andrews placed the child into a trust. Andrews testified she\n\ncustody; (7) the stability of the home or proposed placement; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent which\nmay indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and (9) any excuse for the acts\nor omissions of the parent. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976).\n 3 The statutory best-interest factors include:\n\n(1) whether the physical, psychological, or emotional needs and development of the child\n will benefit from the appointment of joint managing conservators; (2) the ability of the\n parents to give first priority to the welfare of the child and reach shared decisions in the\n child\u2019s best interest; (3) whether each parent can encourage and accept a positive\n relationship between the child and the other parent; (4) whether both parents participated\n in child rearing before the filing of the suit; (5) the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019\n residences; (6) if the child is 12 years of age or older, the child\u2019s preference, if any,\n regarding the person to have the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the\n child; and (7) any other relevant factor.\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a).\n\fagrees to follow court orders \u201cwhen it\u2019s in the best interest of [the child].\u201d She indicated\n\nthat she believed the original Nevada order violated due process and was illegal, which\n\nis why she did not believe she needed to follow it.\n\nThe Holley and statutory best-interest factors are neither exhaustive nor\n\ndeterminative. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a)(7) (permitting a trial court to\n\nconsider any other relevant factors); In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 27 (Tex. 2002) (the Holley\n\nfactors are not exhaustive and some cases may not have evidence of some factors at\n\nall). Courts have considered a parent\u2019s conduct that interferes with the other parent\u2019s\n\nrelationship with their child. See Allen v. Allen, 475 S.W.3d 453, 458 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.); In re Marriage of Chandler, 914 S.W.2d 252, 255 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAmarillo 1996, no writ).\n\nThe record contains significant testimony and evidence that Andrews interfered\n\nwith Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child. The evidence reveals that Andrews:\n\n\u2022 Sometimes refused to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s\n scheduled possession periods;\n\n\u2022 Made negative comments about Denbrock to the child and called\n Denbrock and his family \u201cdemons,\u201d \u201cpsychos,\u201d and \u201cevil monkeys\u201d;\n\n\u2022 Exhibited suicidal ideation and paranoid beliefs about being followed\n and monitored;\n\n\u2022 Engaged in \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d by seeking treatment from multiple\n physicians until receiving preferred responses, often without\n consulting Denbrock;\n\n\u2022 After temporary orders gave Denbrock medical decision-making\n authority, cancelled the child\u2019s four-year check-up and dental\n appointments; and\n\f \u2022 Attempted to open Denbrock\u2019s car doors to obtain the child when no\n supervisor was present, which severely upset the child.\n\nAlthough some of the Holley and statutory best-interest factors could have\n\nsupported a different outcome, that does not mean that the trial court\u2019s order constitutes\n\nan abuse of discretion. The trial court considered Andrews\u2019s extensive history of\n\ninterfering with Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child, as well as his efforts to obtain\n\nproper healthcare for the child, and Andrews\u2019s position regarding following court orders\n\nthat she deems not to be in the child\u2019s best interest. On this record, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by limiting Andrews\u2019s periods of possession and\n\naccess and requiring them to be supervised. Andrews\u2019s first and second issues are\n\noverruled.\n\nChild Support\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that her net monthly resources\n\nwere $9,200\u2014the statutory maximum\u2014resulting in a $1,500 monthly support obligation.\n\nChild support determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, with legal\n\nand factual sufficiency serving as relevant factors rather than independent grounds for\n\nreversal. Banakar v. Krause, 674 S.W.3d 564, 573 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2023,\n\nno pet.). Net resources include income from various sources, including trust income and\n\n\u201call other income actually received.\u201d TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 154.062(b). Trial courts may\n\ncalculate net resources based on imprecise information, particularly when a party fails to\n\nprovide required documentation. In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d 660, 666 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso\n\n2011, no pet.).\n\f Andrews challenges the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that she made\n\n$20,000 in monthly income. Andrews testified that she receives income from her father\u2019s\n\nbusiness that takes in $20,000 to $30,000 monthly, though she claimed her father pays\n\nher only $2,000 to $4,000 monthly \u201cfor the extra stuff.\u201d Notably, though, Andrews refused\n\nto provide trust documents, bank records, or other financial information despite discovery\n\nrequests and a court order compelling production.\n\nHowever, the trial court could also assess Andrews\u2019s credibility regarding her\n\nincome through the other evidence of her expenses: she reported approximately $7,000\n\nin monthly expenses for rent, car payments, and therapy alone\u2014well beyond the $2,000\n\nto $4,000 she claimed to receive. The trial court was free to disbelieve Andrews\u2019s\n\ntestimony regarding her income. See In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d at 666. Moreover, any error\n\nthat the trial court could have made would be the fault of Andrews by contumaciously\n\nrefusing to provide the necessary information to appropriately set child support, despite\n\ndiscovery requests and an order to compel. Accordingly, we conclude that there was at\n\nleast some evidence of a probative and substantive character supporting the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision and determine that the trial court made a reasonable decision based on that\n\nevidence. See Banakar, 674 S.W.3d at 573. Andrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n7"

See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\n2 TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1),(b)(2)(A), (B). Appellant pleaded true to the enhancement\n\nand habitual offender provisions. The range of punishment applicable to Appellant was enhanced to a term\nof confinement of \u201clife, or for any term of not more than 99 years or less than 25 years.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE\nANN. \u00a7 12.42(d).\n\fjury assessed a punishment of 40 years of confinement for each conviction. The trial\n\ncourt sentenced Appellant accordingly and ordered the sentences run concurrently. We\n\noverrule Appellant\u2019s two issues and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAppellant and the complainant, Marisa Espinoza, had been in an on-and-off\n\nromantic relationship since 1996. They have two children together, ages 29 and 11.\n\nEspinoza testified they had conducted a marriage ceremony but never filed official\n\npaperwork, and she would introduce Appellant as both her boyfriend or husband. At the\n\ntime of the charged offense, Appellant had been living with Espinoza for about eight\n\nmonths after being released from custody in January 2022.\n\nOn September 9, 2022, Appellant and Espinoza had been arguing all day. The\n\nargument intensified after Appellant took Espinoza\u2019s truck and was gone longer than\n\nexpected, which angered Espinoza. She began \u201cblowing up his phone\u201d;3 he would not\n\nanswer her calls. When Appellant returned, the discussion escalated, with Appellant\n\ncalling Espinoza names and then engaging in physical violence.\n\nAppellant grabbed Espinoza by her hair and pulled her inside the house. Once\n\ninside the kitchen and dining room area, Appellant struck her in the face and head area\n\nwith his hands. Espinoza testified he hit her \u201cat least three times\u201d with a closed fist.\n\nAppellant also grabbed Espinoza by the throat with his left hand, applying pressure with\n\na force that caused her to feel she \u201cwas being suffocated. Like . . . they\u2019re cutting off your\n\n3 This is a colloquial expression meaning repeatedly calling or texting someone, often in an urgent\n\nor persistent manner. See, e.g., K\u2019ron, Round of Applause, (Atlantic Records 2020). (\u201cShe blowin\u2019 up my\nphone / Won\u2019t leave me alone / She get on my nerves / Where would I be without her?\u201d).\n\fairway.\u201d Meanwhile, Appellant told Espinoza \u201che hates [her], he\u2019s going to kill [her], stuff\n\nlike that.\u201d Espinoza had difficulty breathing, was \u201cscared,\u201d and needed \u201cto get help.\u201d\n\nWhen Espinoza\u2019s brother walked into the room, Appellant released his grip.\n\nEspinoza immediately ran to the front door and called 911. Espinoza\u2019s voice was\n\nnoticeably raspy as she tried to catch her breath. Police officers responding to the scene\n\nobserved visible injuries on Espinoza\u2019s neck, photographed the injuries, and arrested\n\nAppellant for assault by strangulation.\n\nTwo days later, Appellant telephoned Espinoza from jail and told her to instruct\n\nprosecutors to drop the charges. During this call, he admitted he grabbed her by the\n\n\u201cpescuezo,\u201d the Spanish word for \u201cneck.\u201d\n\nANALYSIS\n\nFirst Issue: Double Jeopardy\n\nAppellant argues his convictions for both assault family violence by occlusion and\n\nassault family violence with a prior conviction constitute multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. He\n\nacknowledges the remedy for the alleged violation would be to \u201cretain the conviction with\n\nthe most serious punishment and vacate any remaining convictions\u201d that violate double\n\njeopardy. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent 40-year terms of imprisonment for both\n\nconvictions.\n\f(a) Preservation of Error\n\nThe State argues Appellant failed to preserve this issue. But a double-jeopardy\n\nclaim may be raised for the first time on appeal when (1) the undisputed facts show the\n\nviolation is clearly apparent on the record\u2019s face, and (2) enforcement of procedural\n\ndefault serves no legitimate state interest. Langs v. State, 183 S.W.3d 680, 687 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2006).\n\nWe hold these conditions are met. A claim is apparent on the face of the record if\n\nits resolution does not require additional proceedings to introduce more evidence. Ex\n\nparte Denton, 399 S.W.3d 540, 544 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy\n\nclaim does not require additional proceedings. Moreover, the State presents no\n\npersuasive argument why enforcing procedural default serves any legitimate state\n\ninterest under these circumstances. See Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889, 892 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d); Anderson v. State, No. 10-01-00306-CV, 2003 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 6008, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco July 2, 2003, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n(b) Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\nBrown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977); Ramos v. State, 636 S.W.3d 646, 651 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021). Multiple-punishment violations occur when the same conduct is\n\npunished under distinct statutes where the Legislature intended punishment only once.\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nHere, Appellant contends that the Legislature intended only one punishment,\n\narguing section 22.01(a) is the lesser-included offense of section 22.01(b)(2)(B)\n\f(impeding normal breathing or circulation), which is merely an enhancement of the same\n\ncriminal conduct. \u201cA multiple-punishments violation can arise either in the context of\n\nlesser-included offenses, where the same conduct is punished under a greater and a\n\nlesser-included offense, and when the same conduct is punished under two distinct\n\nstatutes where the Legislature only intended for the conduct to be punished once.\u201d\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nAccordingly, we look to the statute\u2019s text to determine legislative intent. Stevenson,\n\n499 S.W.3d at 850. It is undisputed that occlusion assault (Count I) and assault family\n\nviolence with a prior (Count II) have different elements and that the State proved these\n\nelements at trial. Occlusion assault requires the State prove that a defendant impeded\n\nthe normal breathing or blood circulation of the complainant, while this element is not\n\nrequired for assault family violence with a prior conviction.\n\nThis distinction is of critical importance. In Ortiz v. State, 623 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021), the Court of Criminal Appeals addressed whether bodily-injury assault\n\ncan be a lesser-included offense of occlusion assault and answered \u201cNo.\u201d The Court\n\nemployed an \u201callowable unit of prosecution\u201d analysis to examine what facts are required\n\nto prove each offense. Occlusion assault requires proof of a specific injury\u2014\u201cimpeding\n\nnormal breathing or circulation of the blood\u201d\u2014whereas simple assault requires proof of\n\nany \u201cbodily injury,\u201d broadly defined as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical\n\ncondition.\u201d Id. at 806\u201307. While impeding breathing constitutes bodily injury, it is a distinct\n\ntype that excludes other injuries. The Court illustrated this principle with an analogy:\n\nImpeding is exclusive of other injuries in the same way that a square is\n exclusive of other rectangles: A square is a rectangle, but other rectangles\n\f are not squares; specifying \u201csquare\u201d excludes non-square rectangles; and\n specifying \u201cimpeding\u201d excludes non-impeding injuries.\n\nFor example, if a defendant were charged with occlusion assault, and the\n evidence showed that he stomped on the complainant\u2019s foot and caused\n pain, that assault would not be included in the charged offense because a\n non-impeding injury is not required to prove occlusion assault.\n\nId. at 807. The Court explained that even a non-impeding injury inflicted on the neck\n\nwould not be proven by the same facts needed to prove occlusion assault. If pinching the\n\nneck caused pain but did not impede normal breathing or blood circulation, the assault\n\nwould not be included because the assault by pinching would require proof of a different\n\ninjury than impeding.\n\nThe facts in this appeal are very similar to those in Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Brown involved a defendant who committed both\n\nstrangulation and other assaultive acts against his intimate partner during the same\n\nepisode. The defendant was convicted of both occlusion assault of a household/family\n\nmember and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe Tenth Court of Appeals relied on Ortiz\u2019s methodology to hold that convictions\n\nfor both offenses from the same incident did not violate double jeopardy. Using unit-of-\n\nprosecution analysis, the court determined that both result-oriented offenses have distinct\n\ngravamina: impeding is the focus of occlusion assault and defines its allowable unit of\n\nprosecution while excluding other injuries, whereas bodily-injury assault lacks a statutorily\n\nspecified injury. Id. at 893. The court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in\n\noccluding the complainant\u2019s breathing or blood circulation were separate from other\n\nassaultive acts he committed against her . . . [even] [t]hough the offenses may have\n\foccurred during the same criminal episode . . . .\u201d Id. at 894. Therefore, the court reasoned\n\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. Id. at 893\u201394.\n\nAppellant argues that Brown\u2019s \u201cconclusions are incorrect and both offenses are\n\nsubject to double jeopardy protection.\u201d But as a transferee court from the Tenth Court of\n\nAppeals, we are required to follow Brown\u2019s holding, as that constitutes binding precedent\n\non that court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3; Baker v. State, No. 07-22-00286-CR, 2023 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 5857, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Aug. 7, 2023, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cTexas courts follow\n\nvertical stare decisis (lower courts must follow the precedents of all higher courts) and\n\nhorizontal stare decisis (three-judge panels must follow materially indistinguishable\n\ndecisions of earlier panels of the same court unless a higher authority has superseded\n\nthat prior decision).\u201d Earl v. State, No. 03-23-00427-CR, 2025 Tex. App. LEXIS 4527, at\n\n*9\u201310 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin June 27, 2025, no pet. h.) (citing Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645\n\nS.W.3d 251, 256 (Tex. 2022)).\n\n(c) Application to this Case\n\nThese binding decisions establish a clear rule: Espinoza\u2019s injury from occlusion\n\nassault was not merely different in degree from other assault injuries she received\u2014it\n\nwas different in kind. Ortiz, 623 S.W.3d at 809; see also McCall v. State, 635 S.W.3d 261,\n\n268 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Though Appellant\u2019s offenses occurred during\n\nthe same criminal episode, they are not the same offense for Double Jeopardy purposes\n\nbecause they involve different statutorily-specified injuries requiring proof of different\n\nfacts. Brown, 640 S.W.3d at 894.\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\fSecond Issue: Evidence of Prior Domestic Violence\n\nIn his second issue, Appellant argues the trial court erred by permitting Espinoza\n\nto testify about prior instances of domestic violence between her and Appellant.\n\nTo preserve error regarding evidence admission, a party must object each time\n\ninadmissible evidence is offered, obtain a running objection, or request a hearing outside\n\nthe jury\u2019s presence. Martinez v. State, 98 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); see\n\nalso TEX. R. EVID. 103(b). Here, Appellant voiced a relevance objection when the State\n\nbegan examining Espinoza about past domestic violence episodes, which the trial court\n\noverruled. He did not reurge that objection or request a running objection thereafter.\n\nAdditional evidence of the 2014 judgment documenting Appellant\u2019s guilty plea for assault\n\nfamily violence was admitted without objection. Espinoza also testified without objection\n\nthat she was the victim of that assault and that Appellant routinely asked her to drop\n\ncharges after other past incidents.\n\nMoreover, significant evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt was admitted beyond the prior\n\nviolence testimony. The jury also heard Appellant\u2019s recorded jail call admitting he grabbed\n\nher neck and related testimony.4 It heard Espinoza\u2019s raspy voice on her 911 call.\n\nEspinoza described how Appellant pushed her down, hit her, and grabbed her throat, and\n\nshowed the jury photographic evidence of her injuries.\n\nBecause Appellant did not continue objecting, request a running objection, or seek\n\na hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence, any error was not preserved. See, e.g., Ethington\n\n4 Without objection, Detective Erin McCullough testified that Appellant told Espinoza on the jail call:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really strangle you, I just put my hands around your neck.\u201d McCullough also testified about studies\nshowing strangulation victims are seven times more likely to be murdered by their abuser.\n\fv. State, 819 S.W.2d 854, 859\u201360 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991); Sanchez v. State, 595 S.W.3d\n\n331, 337\u201338 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, no pet.).\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled Appellant\u2019s two issues, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\nDo not publish.\n\n9"

Compl. [Dkt. # 1] at 1. Over the course of litigation, ATF produced documents\n\nin response to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request in thirteen separate productions. See Joint Status Reports\n\n[Dkt. ## 8\u20139, 11\u201319]. But in its final production, the agency inadvertently produced documents\n\nto plaintiffs showing information that had been marked for redaction under FOIA\u2019s statutory\n\nexemptions, but was not actually redacted. Joint Status Report [Dkt # 19] \u00b6 4. The Court issued\n\na temporary protective order sequestering the inadvertently produced records until it could\n\ndetermine whether the information the agency marked for redaction fell properly within the\n\nclaimed FOIA exemptions. Temporary Protective Order (Oct. 30, 2023) [Dkt. # 30] (\u201cTPO\u201d) at 1.\n\nNow before the Court is ATF\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J.\n\n[Dkt. # 32] (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.\u201d), and plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary protective order. See Pls.\u2019\n\fMot. to Lift Protective Order [Dkt. # 36] (\u201cPls.\u2019 Mot.\u201d). Both motions are fully briefed. See Pls.\u2019\n\nResp. to Def.\u2019s Mot.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20134. On April 28,\n\n2021, they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n\nFirearms & Explosives seeking records related to the agency\u2019s use of the National Instant Criminal\n\nBackground Check System (\u201cNICS\u201d). See Ex. A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] (\u201cEx. A\u201d); Compl. \u00b6 8.\n\nThe NICS is the system used \u201cto determine if an individual is prohibited from purchasing a\n\nfirearm.\u201d Second Decl. of Ginae Barnett [Dkt. # 32-3] (\u201cBarnett Decl.\u201d) \u00b6 14. Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs requested:\n\n(a) records showing the number of individuals for whom ATF is requesting\n or has requested NICS monitoring, during the 12-month period preceding\n this request;\n\n(b) records demonstrating the purpose(s) for which each individual has been\n monitored (i.e., suspected straw purchases, false statements, etc.);\n\n(c) records discussing the legality of NICS monitoring;\n\n(d) records demonstrating the number of individuals prosecuted as a result\n of being \u201cmonitored\u201d by the program (criminal case docket numbers will\n suffice); and\n\n(e) records demonstrating any reported unlawful or otherwise improper\n misuse of NICS monitoring by ATF personnel (or contractors of ATF).\n\fEx. A at 2. ATF acknowledged plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request by a letter dated August 24, 2021, see\n\nEx. B to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-2], and it \u201cproceeded to search for responsive records.\u201d Barnett\n\nDecl. \u00b6 4.\n\nHaving received no further response from ATF, on November 5, 2021, plaintiffs filed this\n\nsuit to compel the agency to release the requested information. Compl. at 1, 5. ATF answered the\n\ncomplaint and then, over the next year-and-a-half, it reviewed 4,559 potentially responsive\n\ndocuments, and it \u201cproduced all responsive records in 13 monthly productions.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 6;\n\nsee Def.\u2019s Answer [Dkt. # 5].\n\nOn September 6, 2023, ATF emailed its thirteenth production to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. Id. \u00b6 8.\n\nIt was compromised of \u201ca cover letter and a PDF file\u201d consisting of 115-pages. Id. Like the\n\nprevious twelve productions, the production contained emails in which ATF agents submitted\n\n\u201cNICS monitoring\u201d requests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). Id. \u00b6 13. The emails\n\nshowed the \u201cnames, email addresses, and sometimes telephone numbers\u201d of the ATF agents, FBI\n\nagents, and staff involved. Id. \u00b6 15. Most of the emails also included \u201cthe underlying investigative\n\ntarget\u2019s name\u201d and discussion of the investigation. Id. \u00b6 15. And each monitoring request also\n\nincluded a \u201cstandard form\u201d regarding the individual, or \u201csubject,\u201d for whom monitoring was\n\nrequested. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. The forms enabled the requesters to input the following categories of\n\ninformation:\n\n\u2022 Submit date\n \u2022 Requester\u2019s name, contact number, and e-mail address\n \u2022 Case number\n \u2022 Subject\u2019s name, date of birth, gender, race, social security number, state\n of residence, and place of birth\n \u2022 FBI number\n \u2022 State record number\n \u2022 Monitoring time frame\n \u2022 Suspected violation(s) of the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act\n \u2022 Detailed information about why the subject is under investigation\n\f \u2022 Detailed information about the investigation. What does the requester\n know and how do they know it?\n\nId. \u00b6 15. The last two bullet points on the form calling for \u201cdetailed information\u201d allow the\n\nrequester to provide \u201cnarrative responses,\u201d and some of the responses in the produced documents\n\nincluded: \u201cinformation furnished by witnesses or confidential sources,\u201d id. \u00b6 15; information from\n\nthe agency\u2019s \u201cFirearms Tracing System\u201d database, id. \u00b6 19; and information about the \u201cspecific\n\nlaw enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the investigation. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn advance of the production, ATF marked multiple pieces of information for redaction\n\npursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Barnett Decl. \u00b6 16. Under Exemption\n\n3, it marked for redaction the \u201crecords of specific firearms traces\u201d from the Firearms Tracing\n\nSystem database. Id. \u00b6 19. Under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), it marked for redaction the\n\n\u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d of ATF agents, FBI agents, agency personnel, and the\n\nsubjects, associates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nFinally, under Exemption 7(E), it marked for redaction information revealing \u201cspecific law\n\nenforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure utilized in the previous productions, ATF marked the\n\nrecords to be included in the thirteenth production with \u201cred boxes\u201d outlining the information it\n\nintended to redact. Id. \u00b6 7. The material in each red box was overlaid with text indicating the\n\napplicable FOIA exemption. Id. The procedure to be followed required the processor to select\n\n\u201cApply\u201d to create a new, redacted document. Id. Although the separate, redacted document was\n\ncreated for the thirteenth production, the agency inadvertently emailed plaintiffs a copy of the\n\nprevious version that still showed red boxes outlining the redactions and the contents of the boxes,\n\nnot the version that actually applied the redactions. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7\u20138.\n\f On September 8, 2023, two days after the agency released the thirteenth production,\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked ATF\u2019s counsel in an email, \u201c[c]an I get a redacted version of the final\n\nProduction #13?\u201d Attachment B to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] (emphasis in original). Fifteen\n\nminutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cIt seems there was an inadvertent production. Would\n\nyou please delete any copy that you may have downloaded? ATF will send you a replacement\n\nproduction.\u201d Attachment C to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. Nine minutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel sent\n\n\u201cthe proper version of production 13,\u201d containing the permanently applied redactions. Attachment\n\nD to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3].\n\nOn September 10, ATF\u2019s counsel asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to \u201cconfirm in writing that [he]\n\ndeleted any copy of the inadvertent production,\u201d noting the \u201csignificant privacy interests in the\n\nmaterial[.]\u201d Attachment E to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. The next day, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n\nresponded tartly: \u201cI do not have time today to consider much less respond to this request to delete\n\nwhat I was sent.\u201d Attachment F to Barnett Decl. [Dkt # 32-3] at 1. ATF\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cif you\n\ndo not confirm deletion of the materials, ATF plans to move for a protective order.\u201d Id.\n\nThe next day, a different attorney emailed ATF\u2019s counsel to say that he would \u201cbe\n\nrepresenting\u201d plaintiffs with respect to the \u201cplanned motion for protective order.\u201d Attachment H\n\nto Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] at 1. At that point, plaintiffs had both the redacted version and the\n\ninadvertently unredacted version of the thirteenth production in its possession, and one could easily\n\nascertain whether anything had been omitted that did not fall within a FOIA exemption. Yet\n\ncounsel took the following position:\n\n[O]ur review of these documents demonstrates that they may, like other\n documents received in this FOIA, and perhaps to a greater extent, reveal\n unauthorized or even illegal activity by ATF and the FBI, violating statutory\n requirements and jeopardizing the constitutional rights of federal firearms\n licensees and other Americans. Thus, we are concerned that, if we agree to\n your proposal and destroy the documents in our possession, those\n\f unauthorized or even illegal activities will be covered up by ATF. We do\n not agree voluntarily to be complicit in such a coverup. You have asked for\n our position on a protective order. We oppose . . . . [T]he error here is the\n government\u2019s alone, and we will resist any effort to make it appear that we\n have done anything wrong, or that ATF is somehow the \u201cgood guy\u201d here\n by, under the guise of protecting certain private information that it\n negligently disclosed, attempting to coverup its potential violations of\n statutes and constitutional rights.\n\nId. at 2.\n\nOn September 13, ATF moved for a protective order to shield the \u201cmaterial inadvertently\n\nproduced\u201d from dissemination, disclosure, or use until the Court decided the merits of its FOIA\n\nexemptions. Def.\u2019s Expedited Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 20] at 1, 7\u20138. Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe motion. See Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 28] (\u201cPls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective\n\nOrder\u201d). The Court granted the motion, and it ordered plaintiffs to \u201ctemporarily sequester\u201d the\n\ninadvertently produced file until a decision regarding the redactions could be made on the merits.\n\nTPO at 1.1 Defendant moved for summary judgment on December 8, and the parties fully briefed\n\nthe motion. See Def.\u2019s Mot.; Pls.\u2019 Resp.; Def.\u2019s Reply.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, ATF filed a notice of supplemental authority pointing to the D.C.\n\nCircuit\u2019s decision in Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police, 126 F.4th 708\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2025), and the parties were directed to file submissions addressing its impact on the\n\ndispute. See Def.\u2019s Notice of Suppl. Authority [Dkt. # 35]; Minute Order (Mar. 12, 2025); Pls.\u2019\n\nSuppl. Mem. [Dkt. # 37]; Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. [Dkt. # 38]. Plaintiffs also moved to lift the Court\u2019s\n\nprotective order in light of the Circuit\u2019s ruling. See Pls.\u2019 Mot. That motion is also fully briefed.\n\nSee Def.\u2019s Opp.; Pls.\u2019 Reply. The Court then ordered ATF to submit the unredacted thirteenth\n\n1 The order did not limit plaintiffs\u2019 use of the version of the thirteenth production with the\nredactions properly applied.\n\fproduction to the Court for in camera review, see Minute Order (Apr. 11, 2025), and ATF\n\nsubmitted the materials under seal. See Sealed Doc. [Dkt. # 41].\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\n\nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat summary\n\njudgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue for trial.\u201d Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if a\n\nreasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it is capable\n\nof affecting the outcome of the litigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236,\n\n1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In assessing a party\u2019s motion, the court must \u201cview the facts and draw\n\nreasonable inferences \u2018in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment\n\nmotion.\u2019\u201d Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States\n\nv. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWhen a federal agency receives a request for records under the Freedom of Information\n\nAct, the statute requires it to disclose the requested information unless it falls into one of FOIA\u2019s\n\fnine exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(3)(A), (b)(1)\u2013(9). In a \u201ctypical FOIA case concerning the\n\nwithholding of requested documents,\u201d the court decides \u201cthe applicability of a claimed FOIA\n\nexemption,\u201d Al-Fayed v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 254 F.3d 300, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and if it\n\ndetermines that the information does not fall within the exemption, the requester is entitled to it.\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\n\nThis is not the typical case. During the process of responding to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request,\n\nthe agency inadvertently produced a set of documents that were marked for redaction, but not\n\nactually redacted. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 7. The agency maintains in its motion for summary judgment\n\nthat all of the information designated for redaction falls within Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and\n\n7(E), Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315, and plaintiffs do not dispute that assertion. Plaintiffs \u201ctake no position\u201d\n\non the FOIA exemptions; indeed, they announce that they \u201chave no interest in the vast majority of\n\nthe . . . information ATF disclosed.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. In other words, plaintiffs do not claim that\n\nthey are entitled to any of the information the agency meant to withhold, and having seen it, they\n\nare not suggesting that they have any reason to disseminate the bulk of it further. Nonetheless,\n\nthey object to any order extending restrictions on the use of the material on principle.\n\nThe agency asks the Court to order plaintiffs to: (1) \u201csequester the September 6, 2023,\n\ninadvertently produced FOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate,\n\ndisclose, or use for any purpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent opinion in Human Rights Defense Center v. United\n\nStates Park Police bars the Court from ordering that relief and requires it to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order. See Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem.; Pls.\u2019 Mot. They also contend that an order sequestering\n\nthe inadvertent production would constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 27\u201332.\n\f The Court finds that defendant\u2019s motion and supporting declaration and its own review of\n\nthe materials in camera confirm that all the information marked for redaction in the inadvertent\n\nproduction falls properly within a FOIA exemption. Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment in its favor will be granted on the propriety of the exemptions. This also means that the\n\nCourt\u2019s interim order restricting the use of the information that defendant meant to redact until the\n\nlegitimacy of the redactions had been determined expires under its own terms, TPO at 1,2 and that\n\nthe challenge to that order is now moot.\n\nThe Court also finds that it has equitable authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested relief to bar\n\nplaintiffs from using or disseminating the inadvertently produced information. Plaintiffs have\n\nalready agreed to destroy the majority of the information at issue, which is properly exempt under\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D). Pls.\u2019 Reply at 23. As for the rest of the information, Human Rights\n\nDefense Center v. United States Park Police is distinguishable and does not control the instant\n\nsuit, and both Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent regarding the Court\u2019s equitable authority\n\nunder FOIA support a remedy that bars the use of FOIA-exempted information.\n\nI. All of the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n exemptions claimed by the ATF.\n\nThe ATF marked several sets of information for redaction in the thirteenth production, and\n\nits motion for summary judgment argues that those redactions were proper under FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315. Plaintiffs have \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated\n\n2 Plaintiffs argued that the Court lacked authority to let the temporary protective order stand.\nSee Pls.\u2019 Suppl.

Id. at 6\u201333; see id. at\n\n6 (\u201cATF spends the majority of its briefing arguing that various redactions . . . would have been\n\nappropriate under various FOIA exemptions . . . . Plaintiffs take no position with respect to these\n\narguments.\u201d).\n\nAlthough plaintiffs make no effort to challenge the agency\u2019s FOIA exemptions, \u201c[u]nder\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion for summary judgment cannot be \u2018conceded\u2019 for\n\nwant of opposition.\u201d Winston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\n\u201cThe burden is always on the movant to demonstrate why summary judgment is warranted,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[t]he nonmoving party\u2019s failure to oppose summary judgment does not shift that burden.\u201d Id.,\n\nquoting Grimes v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 83, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Therefore, the Court\n\nmust still determine whether the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n\nexemptions claimed, even though plaintiffs do not contest the exemptions.\n\nThe Court has reviewed the agency\u2019s declaration in support of its motion, as well as the\n\nunredacted version of the thirteenth production in camera, and it concludes that all of the\n\ninformation ATF marked for redaction was properly exempt under FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C),\n\n7(D), and 7(E).\n\n3 See also Joint Status Report [Dkt. # 31] at 2 (\u201cPlaintiffs do not intend to challenge the\nFOIA redactions that could have been claimed, but were not made, on Production 13.\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Resp.\nat 1 n.1 (explaining that plaintiffs \u201cstyle[d]\u201d their opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment as a \u201cResponse\u201d rather than an \u201cOpposition\u201d because \u201cthe only disputed issue between\nthe parties is Defendant\u2019s motion for a permanent protective order . . . not summary judgment\u201d);\nPls.\u2019 Resp. to Def.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Fact [Dkt. # 33-1] at 1 (\u201cPlaintiffs generally\ndo not contest ATF\u2019s Statement of Material Facts . . . .\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Suppl.

Exemption 3\n\nExemption 3 authorizes agencies to withhold information that is \u201cspecifically exempted\n\nfrom disclosure by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The statute must either: (1) \u201crequire[] that the\n\nmatters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,\u201d or\n\n(2) \u201cestablish[] particular criteria for withholding or refer[] to particular types of matters to be\n\nwithheld.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(A)(i)\u2013(ii). And if the statute was \u201cenacted after the date of enactment\n\nof the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\u201d it must \u201cspecifically cite[] to\u201d FOIA. Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(B). To\n\njustify its withholding, the agency \u201cneed only show that the statute claimed is one of exemption as\n\ncontemplated by Exemption 3 and that the withheld material falls within the statute.\u201d Larson v.\n\nDep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\nATF invoked Exemption 3 to withhold information regarding \u201cspecific firearms traces\u201d\n\nderived from ATF\u2019s Firearms Tracing System (\u201cFTS\u201d) database, most of which appears in the\n\nNICS monitoring request forms to explain \u201cwhy [ATF\u2019s] subject [was] under investigation.\u201d\n\nBarnett Decl. \u00b6 19. The agency asserts that the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552 (2011) (\u201cthe Act of 2012\u201d), bars it\n\nfrom disclosing the contents of the Firearms Tracing System. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5.\n\nCongress restricted the ATF\u2019s ability to disclose firearms tracing information in 2003,\n\nwhen it passed the Tiahrt Amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003,\n\nPub. L. No. 108-7, 117 Stat. 11 (2003). See id. \u00a7 644 (\u201cNo funds appropriated under this\n\nAct . . . shall be available to take any action based upon any provision of [FOIA] with respect to\n\nrecords collected or maintained . . . in connection with . . . the tracing of a firearm[.]\u201d); Barnett\n\nDecl. \u00b6 18. Iterations of this restriction have appeared in most, if not all, of the consolidated\n\fappropriations acts since 2003,4 until its most recent version in the Act of 2012. The current Act\n\nrequires:\n\nThat, during the current fiscal year and in each fiscal year thereafter, no\n funds appropriated under this or any other Act may be used to disclose part\n or all of the contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by\n the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\n Explosives . . . pursuant to section 923(g) of title 18, United States Code, or\n required to be reported pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (7) of such section,\n except to: (1) a Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement agency, or a\n Federal, State, or local prosecutor; or (2) a foreign law enforcement agency\n solely in connection with or for use in a criminal investigation or\n prosecution; or (3) a Federal agency for a national security or intelligence\n purpose; . . . and no person or entity described in (1), (2) or (3) shall\n knowingly and publicly disclose such data; and all such data shall be\n immune from legal process, shall not be subject to subpoena or other\n discovery, shall be inadmissible in evidence, and shall not be used, relied\n on, or disclosed in any manner, nor shall testimony or other evidence be\n permitted based on the data, in a civil action in any State (including the\n District of Columbia) or Federal court or in an administrative proceeding\n other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n Firearms and Explosives to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of such\n title, or a review of such an action or proceeding . . . .\n\nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat.\n\n552, 609\u2013610.\n\nBased on this language, most courts in this district have held that the government may\n\nwithhold trace information from the Firearms Trace System under Exemption 3. See, e.g.,\n\nAbdeljabbar v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 74 F. Supp. 3d 158, 172\u201377\n\n4 See Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L.

Sept. 1, 2005); McRae v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 869 F. Supp. 2d 151, 163 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nAnd although one court has held that the ATF cannot rely on the Act because it does not\n\n\u201cexpressly\u201d reference FOIA, see Fowlkes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives,\n\n67 F. Supp. 3d. 290, 300\u201301 (D.D.C. 2014), the Court is persuaded by the reasoning in Abdeljabbar\n\nthat:\n\n[T]he disclosure prohibitions set forth by Congress in the 2005 and 2008\n appropriations bills are still effective prospectively and beyond those fiscal\n years as a permanent prohibition, until such time as Congress expresses the\n intent to repeal or modify them. . . . Congress\u2019s uninterrupted use of this\n language in appropriations bills after 2009 supports the conclusion that\n Congress did not intend for the judiciary to depart from this long-standing\n position.\n\n74 F. Supp. 3d at 175\u201376. For their part, plaintiffs offer no reason as to why the Court should\n\ncome to a contrary conclusion; they do not argue against the agency\u2019s application of Exemption 3\n\nat all.\n\nThe Court has observed the information at issue and confirmed that it contains the firearms\n\ntracing information that the ATF is barred from publicly releasing. Therefore, the Court finds that\n\nthe agency\u2019s invocation of Exemption 3 is proper.\n\nB. Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D)\n\nATF invoked Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D) for the bulk of the information it marked for\n\nredaction: the personal information of ATF and FBI agents, agency personnel, and the subjects,\n\nassociates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Barnett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) serve similar goals. Exemption 6 shields any \u201cpersonnel and\n\nmedical files and similar files\u201d where \u201cdisclosure . . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\finvasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). The exemption is \u201cconstrued broadly to\n\ncover essentially all information sought from Government records that \u2018appl[y] to a particular\n\nindividual,\u2019\u201d Pinson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 202 F. Supp. 3d 86, 99 (D.D.C. 2016), quoting U.S.\n\nDep\u2019t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982), including \u201cpersonal information, such\n\nas names and addresses.\u201d Prison Legal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015),\n\nquoting Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Similarly,\n\nExemption 7(C) protects from disclosure information in law enforcement records that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(c).\n\nAlthough the application of both exemptions \u201cturns on a balance of the individual\u2019s right\n\nof privacy against the basic policy of opening agency action to the light of public scrutiny,\u201d CEI\n\nWash. Bureau, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 469 F.3d 126, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2006), (citation omitted),\n\nthe D.C. Circuit has held that Exemption 7(C) \u201cestablishes a lower bar for withholding material\u201d\n\nthan Exemption 6. Am. C.L. Union v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations\n\nomitted). So \u201cwhen an agency seeks to withhold records \u2018compiled for law enforcement purposes\u2019\n\nas implicating personal privacy, only Exemption 7(C) need be considered, since \u2018all information\n\nthat would fall within the scope of Exemption 6 would also be immune from disclosure under\n\nExemption 7(C.)\u2019\u201d Battle Born Invs. Co., LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., Civ. Action No. 24-067,\n\n2024 WL 5246515, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 2024), quoting Roth v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 642 F.3d\n\n1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nATF has shown that its redactions were appropriate under Exemption 7(C). As the\n\nagency\u2019s declarant explained, ATF \u201capplied minimal redactions as necessary to prevent the\n\ndisclosure of information that might reveal the identities of third parties\u201d within the production,\n\fincluding: (1) the personally identifiable information of ATF and FBI agents, and agency staff;\n\n(2) the social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, cell phone numbers, and family\n\nrelationships of the subjects of agency investigation; and (3) the identities of cooperating sources\n\nwho provided information to the government. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 27. There is a well-recognized and\n\nsubstantial privacy interest in withholding the identities of the law enforcement officers and\n\nsupport personnel conducting investigations. See, e.g., Lesar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 636 F.2d 472,\n\n487 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The Court of Appeals has also held that Exemption 7(C) protects the privacy\n\ninterests of all persons mentioned in law enforcement records, including suspects, witnesses, and\n\ninformants, Schrecker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and that such\n\nthird-party information is \u201ccategorically exempt\u201d from disclosure in the absence of an overriding\n\npublic interest. Nation Mag., Wash. Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 894, 896 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995).\n\nFurther, the agency\u2019s claimed redactions under Exemption 7(D) were proper. Exemption\n\n7(D) protects from disclosure information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . . . [who] furnished\n\ninformation on a confidential basis.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). A source is \u201cconfidential\u201d within\n\nthe meaning of Exemption 7(D) if they \u201cprovided information under an express assurance of\n\nconfidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.\u201d\n\nWilliams v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 69 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Here, the agency\u2019s\n\ndeclaration explains that the sources it redacted had provided tips to the ATF \u201cregarding potential\n\nillegal acquisition of firearms . . . with the implied assurance of confidentiality.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6\n\n25. The sources \u201chave ongoing relationships with ATF\u201d and \u201cwould likely be subject to retaliation\n\ffor that cooperation,\u201d so it is reasonable to infer that they provided information to the agency with\n\nthe understanding that their identities would be kept confidential. Id.\n\nAgain, plaintiff does not contest any of ATF\u2019s arguments regarding the application of\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), or 7(D), and the Court\u2019s review confirms the agency\u2019s assertions. Therefore,\n\nthe Court finds that ATF properly claimed these exemptions.\n\nC. Exemption 7(E)\n\nExemption 7(E) protects from disclosure law enforcement records \u201cto the extent that the\n\nproduction of such . . . information . . . would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). Exemption 7(E) \u201csets a relatively low bar\n\nfor the agency to justify withholding.\u201d Blackwell v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 646 F.3d 37, 42\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \u201cRather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing how the law will be\n\ncircumvented,\u201d it \u201conly requires that the [agency] demonstrate logically how the release of the\n\nrequested information might create a risk of circumvention of the law.\u201d Mayer Brown LLP v.\n\nInternal Revenue Serv., 562 F.3d 1190, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\nATF\u2019s declarant stated that the information claimed under Exemption 7(E) \u201creveals\n\nspecific law enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used to \u201cidentify certain individuals as\n\ninvestigative subjects.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 31. The information appears in the sections of the NICS\n\nforms asking for \u201cwhy\u201d the subject is under investigation and \u201chow\u201d ATF knows information\n\nabout the subject. Id. The Court agrees with ATF that disclosure of how the agency finds its\n\finvestigative subjects could logically enable individuals to \u201ccircumvent\u201d those techniques, id., so\n\nit finds that the agency\u2019s claim under Exemption 7(E) is proper.5\n\nD. Segregability\n\n\u201c[N]on-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably\n\nintertwined with exempt portions.\u201d Wilderness Soc\u2019y v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 2d 1,\n\n18 (D.D.C. 2004), quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1977). ATF\u2019s declaration explains that responsive records were reviewed \u201con a line-\n\nby-line and page-by-page basis\u201d to identify reasonably segregable information, and that all\n\n\u201cmeaningful segregable information was disclosed\u201d to plaintiffs. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 32. The Court\n\nhas also reviewed the un-redacted version of the production, and it came to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, it finds that the agency\u2019s redactions satisfy the segregability requirement.\n\nII. The Court has authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested order.\n\nWhat is left to determine is what, if anything, should happen now. Because the unredacted\n\ncopy of the thirteenth production was inadvertently produced to plaintiffs, ATF asks the Court for\n\nan order directing plaintiffs and their counsel to: (1) \u201csequester the . . . inadvertently produced\n\n5 Citing Conservation Force v. Jewell, 66 F. Supp. 3d 46, 64 (D.D.C. 2014), plaintiffs assert\nthat the ATF cannot withhold information regarding its law enforcement techniques and\nprocedures under Exemption 7(E) because those \u201ctechniques and procedures . . . are unlawful and\nunconstitutional.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 26 (emphasis in original). Indeed, plaintiffs spend a large portion\nof their brief arguing that the ATF and FBI\u2019s use of the NICS is illegal. Id. at 12\u201326. But plaintiffs\nhave not brought a suit against the agencies challenging the legality of the use of NICS; they chose\nto bring a claim under the Freedom of Information Act to enforce their request for information\nabout the ATF\u2019s use of NICS. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16\u201318. FOIA is a statute concerned with the disclosure\nof information in the government\u2019s possession.\n At any rate, Conservation Force is not on point. In that case, the agency withheld\ninformation pursuant to the attorney-client privilege under Exemption 5, and the court analyzed\nwhether the crime-fraud exception to the privilege applied. 66 F. Supp. 3d at 64; see id. (\u201cPlaintiff\nhas failed to prove that any crime or fraud was committed here, let alone that the communications\nat issue were made with an intent to further the unlawful act.\u201d). This case involves withholdings\nunder Exemption 7(E), which does not recognize an exception for crime or fraud.\n\fFOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate, disclose, or use for any\n\npurpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14.\n\nPlaintiffs take issue with the remedy only as it pertains to \u201csmall portions of [the]\n\nunredacted information.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. They do not \u201chave any interest in\u201d and \u201cagree to\n\ndestroy\u201d such records related to personally identifying information of the ATF and FBI agents,\n\nagency staff, and the subjects, associates, and informants of ATF investigation. Id. at 23\u201324. But\n\nthey do challenge the issuance of an order limiting the use of the unredacted information \u201crelated\n\nto the FBI and ATF\u2019s warrantless NICS Monitoring Program.\u201d Id. at 6, 15; see id. at 16\u201321\n\n(arguing that the public has significant interest in learning about how the \u201cNICS Monitoring\n\nProgram\u201d violates statutory prohibits and constitutional rights).\n\nSince plaintiffs have already agreed to destroy the personal information that the agency\n\nredacted under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), the Court will order it to do so. As to the rest of the\n\ninformation marked for redaction under Exemptions 3 and 7(E), the Court finds that it has the\n\nauthority to issue an order barring that information from dissemination or use.\n\na. Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police does not bar the\n Court from granting relief.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police\n\n(\u201cHRDC\u201d), 126 F.4th 708 (D.C. Cir. 2025), \u201csquarely rejected the notion\u201d that district courts have\n\ninherent authority to limit the use or dissemination of inadvertently disclosed FOIA material, and\n\ntherefore, the Court cannot grant ATF\u2019s relief.

Mem. at 5; Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 3\u20137.\n\nDefendant counters that HRDC does not bar the relief sought here because: (1) it is distinguishable\n\nfrom this case; and (2) the Court can rely on its \u201cequitable power\u201d under FOIA, as opposed to its\n\n\u201cinherent authority,\u201d to enforce its judgment. Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. at 4\u20135; Def.\u2019s Opp. at 2\u20133.\n\f In HRDC, the plaintiff submitted FOIA requests to the Park Police for records of certain\n\n\u201cclaims or lawsuits brought against the agency or its employees.\u201d 126 F.4th at 714. The agency\n\nPolice released the records and \u201cwithheld the names of four police officers\u201d under Exemption 6.\n\nId. But \u201cdue to errors in its redaction process,\u201d the Park Police accidentally disclosed two names\n\nof private claimants that also should have been withheld under Exemption 6. Id. at 713\u201314. The\n\ndistrict court held that the Exemption 6 withholdings were justified as to both the officers and the\n\nprivate claimants, and it \u201cinvoked its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings . . . to issue\n\na clawback order for the erroneously produced names.\u201d Id. at 712, 714\u201315.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit reversed both rulings. First, it held that the withholding of the four\n\nofficers\u2019 names was improper because the agency failed to satisfy \u201cits burden to show that\n\ndisclosure . . . would compromise a substantial privacy interest.\u201d Id. at 715. The Court observed\n\nthat the Park Police\u2019s Vaughn index and supporting declarations were \u201cwholly conclusory,\u201d lacked\n\n\u201ceven minimal substantiation of the officers\u2019 privacy interest or the potential harm from disclosing\n\ntheir names,\u201d and \u201cmerely recite[d] the elements of the analysis for whether Exemption 6\n\napplie[d].\u201d Id. at 715\u201316.\n\nThen, without commenting on whether the inadvertently produced private citizens\u2019 names\n\nfell under Exemption 6, the Court vacated the clawback order. 126 F.4th at 719\u2013720. It took issue\n\nwith the lower court\u2019s use of its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings as a\n\n\u201cmechanism\u201d for compelling the return of inadvertently produced information when FOIA itself\n\ndid not provide for that remedy. Id. at 717. It stated that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s invocation of an inherent\n\npower must\u201d be either: (1) \u201cdocumented by historical practice\u201d; or 2) \u201csupported by an irrefutable\n\nshowing that the exercise of an undoubted authority would otherwise be set to naught.\u201d Id. at 718,\n\nquoting Cobell v. Norton, 334 F.3d 1128, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\n\fomitted). The Park Police did not argue that clawback was a \u201cdocumented historical practice,\u201d so\n\nthe Court only analyzed whether it was \u201cnecessary to buttress the district court\u2019s undoubted\n\nauthority over FOIA litigation.\u201d Id. at 718 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Circuit found that the order was not necessary, rejecting the agency\u2019s argument that it\n\nwas proper given the lower court\u2019s ruling that the inadvertently produced names fell under\n\nExemption 6. Id. at 718\u201319. The Circuit explained that \u201cnecessary\u201d orders were \u201climited to those\n\nwhich . . . are necessary to the exercise of all others,\u201d and it then listed the \u201cpowers\u201d previously\n\n\u201crecognized as necessary,\u201d including: admitting members to the bar, disciplining bar members,\n\npunishing contempt of court, vacating judgments based on fraud on the court, and punishing bad-\n\nfaith or vexatious conduct. Id. at 718, citing Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43\u201345 (1991)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because, in the Circuit\u2019s view, the \u201cprimary function\u201d of the\n\nclawback order at issue was \u201cnot to support a core judicial authority, but to fill a perceived hole in\n\nthe FOIA statute by enabling the government to put the proverbial cat back in the bag,\u201d the Court\n\nheld that it was an improper use of inherent authority. Id. at 718\u201319.\n\nThe Court went on to note that the clawback remedy could not \u201cbe squared with the terms\u201d\n\nor \u201cstructure\u201d of FOIA, given that the statute does not explicitly enable an agency to seek an order\n\ncorrecting an inadvertent disclosure. 126 F.4th at 719. The Court opined that \u201cCongress\n\npresumably acted deliberately in omitting general clawback authority from FOIA,\u201d and that,\n\n\u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations,\n\nFOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance governmental transparency.\u201d Id.\n\nStill, the Court observed:\n\nImportantly, the information at issue here is not subject to any independent\n legal prohibition on disclosure such as applies to classified documents, and\n we express no opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n analysis.\n\fId.\n\nOne problem with applying HRDC to the facts of the instant case is that the Circuit\u2019s\n\nanalysis on whether the agency properly invoked Exemption 6 referred only to the \u201cofficer names\u201d\n\nredacted by the agency, id. at 715\u201317, not the private claimants\u2019 names that were inadvertently\n\nproduced. As to that information, the Circuit moved directly to the question of whether the lower\n\ncourt had the authority to issue the clawback order at all, without deciding whether Exemption 6\n\napplied to the names in the first place. Id. at 718\u201319. So, it is not clear whether the Court\u2019s\n\ndiscussion about the clawback order was meant to reach inadvertently disclosed information that\n\nis properly, or as in this case, concededly, exempt.\n\nFurthermore, a close reading of HRDC reveals several important distinctions between that\n\ncase and this one. First, HRDC involved a plaintiff that was disputing the agency\u2019s withholdings\n\nunder FOIA, so the Circuit did not deal with the circumstances here: plaintiffs who did not contest\n\nthe agency\u2019s FOIA withholdings at all, and who have \u201cno interest\u201d in the majority of the\n\ninformation at issue. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. Given HRDC\u2019s determination that the Park Police failed to\n\nsupport its withholdings, it makes sense that clawback would not be available, whether or not it\n\nwas a proper exercise of authority, because the agency was not entitled to withhold the information\n\nin the first place. That is not the case here. As the Court has detailed, everything marked for\n\nredaction by the ATF was properly exempt, and the plaintiffs have agreed to destroy most of the\n\ninadvertently produced information.\n\nSecond, the majority of the information that plaintiffs seek to retain and to be able to\n\ndisseminate falls under Exemption 3, which authorizes ATF to withhold information that is\n\n\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure\u201d by the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). HRDC specifically carved Exemption 3 out of\n\fits ruling, noting that the information at issue was \u201cnot subject to any independent legal prohibition\n\non disclosure\u201d and that it expressed \u201cno opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n\nanalysis.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719. So, by its own language, the case does not bar the Court from granting\n\nrelief as to the Exemption 3 information, and it would be consistent with FOIA and the Act of\n\n2012 to restrain plaintiffs from disseminating such material.\n\nGiven the differences between the posture of this case and what the Court addressed in\n\nHRDC, that opinion does not control the outcome here.6\n\nIII. The law supports the Court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers under FOIA to\n fashion a remedy in accordance with Exemptions 3 and 7(E).\n\nAs far as the Court is aware, no court in this district has invoked its equitable power to bar\n\na plaintiff from disseminating or using information obtained by virtue of an agency\u2019s inadvertent\n\nproduction of FOIA-exempted information. The Freedom of Information Act itself says very little\n\nabout the remedies available under the statute. Its only language regarding the court\u2019s authority is\n\nsection 552(a)(4)(B), which vests \u201cthe district court\u201d with \u201cjurisdiction to enjoin the agency from\n\n6 The Court of Appeals in HRDC opined that the district court lacked inherent authority to\nmanage the case before it because \u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine\nthe parties\u2019 rights and obligations, FOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance\ngovernmental transparency.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719 (emphasis added). In this Court\u2019s view, that\nsentence ignores the fact that in many of the FOIA cases pending in this courthouse, the plaintiff\nhad to bring a lawsuit to activate the administrative process, and that often, it takes the court\u2019s\noversight and involvement to bring it to its conclusion. Once a lawsuit has been filed, the\nrelationship between the parties is not simply governed by agency regulations; it is the district\ncourt that establishes the schedule for the review and production of records by issuing orders. That\nis litigation. And during FOIA litigation, as in other civil litigation, the court may be called upon\nto manage and resolve disputes between the parties, or to direct them to take certain action by\nissuing other orders. Indeed, the FOIA statute explicitly recognizes this fundamental distinction\nbetween FOIA compliance as an administrative matter and FOIA litigation since it provides for an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs when a plaintiff has \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d in an\naction before the Court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). For those reasons, this Court takes issue with\nthe reasoning underlying that portion of the HRDC decision. But for the purposes of its ruling\nhere, the Court is adhering to Circuit authority, and its ruling with respect to the protective order\nis not predicated on \u201cinherent authority.\u201d\n\fwithholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld\n\nfrom the complainant.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). But both the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit\n\nhave commented on the relationship between FOIA and the court\u2019s equitable powers, and the\n\nextent to which a district court can fashion equitable remedies under the statute.\n\nIn Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1 (1974), a consolidation of\n\nthree cases, the FOIA requesters were companies that had contracts with the United States that\n\nwere subject to renegotiation under the Renegotiation Act. Id. at 3. During the negotiation process,\n\nthe government took the position that the companies had \u201crealized excessive profits\u201d under their\n\ncontracts, and when it refused to provide the documents supporting that determination, each\n\ncompany sought the information through FOIA requests. Id. at 4\u20135. After the government failed\n\nto respond to the requests, the companies filed suit under FOIA to compel the release of the\n\ninformation, and to enjoin \u201cany further renegotiation proceedings\u201d until the production. Id. at 5\u20136.\n\nThe district courts enjoined the renegotiation proceedings for each company. Id. at 6\u20138.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court ultimately found \u201cit unnecessary\u201d to decide whether the\n\ndistrict court could enjoin the negotiation proceedings because the companies had failed to exhaust\n\ntheir administrative remedies under the Renegotiation Act, id. at 20, it did comment on FOIA\u2019s\n\neffect on the court\u2019s equitable power to do so. First, the Court noted FOIA\u2019s purpose of \u201copening\n\nadministrative processes to the scrutiny of the press and general public,\u201d id. at 17, and the statute\u2019s\n\nlanguage conferring \u201cjurisdiction to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin\n\nthe agency from withholding agency records . . . improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\nat 18, citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(3). It then explained that while the statute\u2019s purpose and language\n\n\u201cmight suggest\u201d that \u201ccompelled production was intended to be the exclusive enforcement\n\nmethod,\u201d there was \u201clittle to suggest\u201d that FOIA \u201climit[s] the inherent powers of an equity court.\u201d\n\fId. at 19\u201320. In particular, the Court was persuaded that enjoining the release of information was\n\nnot the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d under FOIA because of: \u201c[t]he broad language of the FOIA, with its\n\nobvious emphasis on disclosure and with its exemptions carefully delineated as exceptions\u201d; \u201cthe\n\ntruism that Congress knows how to deprive a court of broad equitable power when it chooses so\n\nto do\u201d; and \u201cthe fact that [FOIA], to a definite degree, makes the District Court the enforcement\n\narm of the statute.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has provided further analysis on the extent and nature of the court\u2019s\n\nremedial power in FOIA cases, which it summarized and applied in Citizens for Responsibility and\n\nEthics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice (\u201cCREW\u201d), 846 F.3d 1235 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2017).\n\nIn CREW, the plaintiff sued to compel the Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d)\u2019s compliance\n\nwith FOIA\u2019s \u201creading-room\u201d provision, which \u201crequires agencies to \u2018make available for public\n\ninspection . . .\u2019 certain records, including . . . \u2018statements of policy and interpretations which have\n\nbeen adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1239, quoting\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2). The plaintiff asserted that OLC opinions were subject to the reading-room\n\nprovision, and it sought an injunction directing OLC to disclose all such documents. Id. at 1239\u2013\n\n40. But in addition to that primary form of relief, the requested injunction had four additional\n\n\u201cfeatures\u201d:\n\n(1) it would apply prospectively . . . to documents not yet created; (2) it\n would impose an affirmative obligation to disclose . . . documents\n regardless of whether someone specifically requests a given document;\n (3) it would mandate that OLC make documents available to the public, as\n opposed to just [the plaintiff]; and (4) it would require OLC to make\n available to the public an index of all such documents.\n\nId. at 1240 (emphasis in original). Concerned that FOIA did not give a district court the power\n\nto order the requested relief, the plaintiff sued under section 704 of the Administrative Procedure\n\fAct, which authorizes review of agency actions \u201cfor which there is no other adequate remedy in\n\na court.\u201d Id. at 1241, quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. But the district court dismissed the case because it\n\nfound that FOIA would provide for the plaintiff\u2019s requested remedy. Id. at 1238, 1240.\n\nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit considered whether the plaintiff could obtain the relief it was\n\nseeking under FOIA. Id. at 1241\u201342. First, it drew lessons from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in\n\nRenegotiation Board:\n\nFOIA section 552(a)(4)(B) vests courts with broad equitable authority.\n True, as the Supreme Court explained in Renegotiation Board v.\n Bannercraft Clothing Co., . . . that provision \u201cexplicitly confers jurisdiction\n to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin the agency\n from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency\n records improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d . . . But as the Court\n made clear in the same decision, Congress did not intend that language \u201cto\n limit the inherent powers of an equity court\u201d in FOIA cases. . . . \u201cOnce\n invoked, the scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers is broad, for breadth\n and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\u201d . . . This is especially so\n where, as here, \u201cfederal law is at issue and \u2018the public interest is involved,\u2019\n as a federal court\u2019s \u2018equitable powers assume an even broader and more\n flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.\u2019\u201d\n\nId. at 1241\u201342 (citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Court then explained that its own \u201ccase law reflects the wide latitude courts possess to\n\nfashion remedies under FOIA, including the power to issue prospective injunctive relief.\u201d Id. at\n\n1242. It pointed to Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), where\n\nthe Court said it was confronted with the Air Force\u2019s \u201crepeated failure to disclose documents in\n\nresponse to\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s valid FOIA requests. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242, citing Payne, 837 F.2d\n\nat 487. The Air Force eventually complied with the requests during the lawsuit, but because the\n\ngovernment exhibited a pattern of \u201crepeated delays\u201d and the plaintiff had an \u201cundeniable right\u201d to\n\nthe requested information, the Court of Appeals instructed the district court to: \u201cevaluate the\n\nlikelihood that the Air Force will return to its illicit practice of delay in the absence of an\n\finjunction\u201d and to \u201cconsider the propriety of injunctive relief\u201d to prevent future delay. Payne, 837\n\nF.2d at 488, 495.\n\nCREW then pointed to Morley v. Central Intelligence Agency, 508 F.3d 1108, 1120 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2007), as an example where it \u201crecognized courts\u2019 power to order relief beyond the simple\n\nrelease of extant records.\u201d CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. In Morley, the Court determined that the\n\nagency had failed to search for responsive material in a portion of records that were likely to be\n\nresponsive. 508 F.3d at 1119\u201320. Because FOIA has a \u201cpolicy of full agency disclosure,\u201d and a\n\nrefusal to release documents for reasons unrelated to the FOIA exemptions would constitute\n\nwithholding, the Court ordered the agency to conduct a more adequate search of its records, id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted), even though FOIA does not specifically provide\n\nfor that remedy.\n\nCREW cautioned, though, that \u201c[a]lthough broad, courts\u2019 remedial authority under section\n\n552(a)(4)(B) is not boundless,\u201d 846 F.3d at 1242, and it pointed to two previously recognized\n\nlimits. First, it noted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for\n\nFreedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980), that \u201cfederal courts have no authority to order the\n\nproduction\u201d of records no longer in the agency\u2019s possession. Id. at 139.\n\nThen it described the Circuit\u2019s decision in Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. United States\n\nDepartment of the Interior, 88 F.3d 1191 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In that case, the plaintiff sought an\n\norder requiring an agency to publish its regulations in the Federal Register in accordance with\n\nsection 552(a)(1) of FOIA. Id. at 1201\u201302. Although that section requires agencies to \u201cpublish . . .\n\nsubstantive rules of general applicability,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D), the Circuit looked to the\n\nremedial provision of FOIA to determine whether the relief sought was proper, and the Court found\n\nthat it could not order publication. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303. The remedial provision\n\fauthorizes courts \u201cto enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the\n\nproduction of any agency records improperly withheld from complainant.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). The Court reasoned that the language focusing on the \u201cproduction\u201d of\n\nrecords to \u201cthe complainant\u201d was aimed at \u201crelieving the injury suffered by the individual\n\ncomplainant, not by the general public,\u201d so it could not order the publication of regulations to the\n\npublic. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303.7\n\nAfter that discussion, the Court held in CREW that the district court had authority under\n\nFOIA to grant two of the forms of relief requested by the plaintiff: a prospective injunction to\n\ndisclose OLC opinions that had not yet been created, and an affirmative duty to disclose regardless\n\nof whether the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. But, relying on\n\nKennecott, it held that FOIA did not authorize the court to order OLC to make documents available\n\nto the public at large, as opposed to just the plaintiff. Id. at 1243.\n\nConsidering that authority, the Court finds that it falls within its equitable powers under\n\nFOIA to fashion a remedy that would bar the plaintiff from publishing inadvertently disclosed\n\ninformation that falls squarely within Exemptions 3 and 7(E). The Freedom of Information Act\n\nvests the district court with \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to settle disputes brought under the statute. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). Although section 552(a)(4)(B) states that courts can \u201cenjoin\u201d an agency from\n\nwithholding records, the Supreme Court recognized in Renegotiation Board that enjoining the\n\nagency is not the \u201cexclusive\u201d power under the statute, and that the language of that provision does\n\nnot \u201climit\u201d the Court\u2019s equitable power to grant other relief. 415 U.S. at 20. While FOIA is a\n\ndisclosure statute, Congress included nine exemptions that authorize the government to withhold\n\n7 The Court acknowledged, though, that \u201cit might seem strange for Congress to command\nagencies to \u2018currently publish\u2019 . . . documents, without in the same statute providing courts with\npower to order publication.\u201d Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202.\n\finformation, to advance a number of important interests. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(1)\u2013(9). The\n\nexemption at issue here, Exemption 3, makes it clear that FOIA disclosure cannot frustrate other\n\nstatutes that mandate against dissemination. And Exemption 7(E), which is involved to a lesser\n\nextent, gives special protection to law enforcement procedures and techniques to guard against\n\nfuture circumvention of the law. These interests, which were absent in HRDC, support the\n\ninjunction. Also, since this case involves the agency\u2019s attempt to withhold information that the\n\nstatute expressly exempts from public disclosure, it does not present the problem posed in\n\nKennecott Utah Copper Corp., where the court was being asked to take action that fell well outside\n\nthe statutory scheme.\n\nTherefore, the Court will exercise its equitable jurisdiction to enter an order barring the use\n\nof inadvertently disclosed information covered by Exemption 3 and 7(E).\n\nIV. The relief does not violate plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nFinally, plaintiffs contend that a protective order forbidding the dissemination of the\n\ninadvertently released information constitutes \u201ca classic prior restraint\u201d in violation of the First\n\nAmendment. Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective Order at 19.\n\n\u201cThe term prior restraint is used to describe . . . judicial orders forbidding certain\n\ncommunications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\u201d\n\nAlexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). A \u201cclassic\u201d case of prior restraint involves a governmental actor seeking a temporary\n\nrestraining order or permanent injunction to prevent the news media from publishing specific\n\ninformation. Id. at 550; see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)\n\n(featuring the President\u2019s attempt to secure a permanent injunction preventing the publication of\n\nthe Pentagon Papers after a whistleblower covertly shared them with the news media); Near v.\n\fMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697 (1931) (featuring local government officials seeking to\n\npermanently enjoin a local newspaper\u2019s publication of periodicals critical of the government).\n\nThis case does not present an unconstitutional prior restraint. \u201cAs a general rule, citizens\n\nhave no first amendment right of access to traditionally nonpublic government information,\u201d and\n\ntherefore \u201c[a] litigant seeking release of government information under FOIA . . . relies upon a\n\nstatutory entitlement \u2013 as narrowed by statutory exceptions \u2013 and not upon his constitutional right\n\nto free expression.\u201d McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Again, plaintiffs\n\ndid not contest the ATF\u2019s claimed FOIA exemptions, and the Court has already found that the\n\ninformation was properly exempt under the statute. So, because plaintiffs do not have a right to\n\nthe material found to be exempt under Exemptions 3 and7(E) in the first place, the Court\u2019s order\n\nsequestering it is not a violation of their First Amendment rights.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court will GRANT defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment [Dkt. # 32], and it will DENY AS MOOT plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order [Dkt. # 36]. A separate order will issue.\n\nAMY BERMAN JACKSON\n United States District Judge\n\nDATE: July 23, 2025\n\n29"

Coughenour, District Judge, Presiding\n\nSubmitted June 4, 2025\n Seattle, Washington\n\nBefore: Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould, and Patrick J. Bumatay, Circuit\nJudges.\n\nOpinion by Judge Gould;\n Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge Bumatay\n\nGOULD, Circuit Judge:\n\nWashington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon (\u201cStates\u201d) and individual expectant\n\nmothers (\u201cIndividual Plaintiffs\u201d) challenge as unconstitutional Executive Order No.\n\n14160 (\u201cExecutive Order\u201d), which purports to deny citizenship to the children born\n\nin United States territory of parents temporarily or unlawfully present in the United\n\nStates. See Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, Exec. Order\n\nNo. 14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). The district court entered a universal\n\npreliminary injunction which bars implementation of the Executive Order.\n\nDefendants appeal, contending that the States lack standing to challenge the\n\nExecutive Order, that it was error to issue a preliminary injunction, and that the scope\n\n2 25-807\n\fof the injunction is overbroad.\n\nWe address whether the Executive Order is constitutional and valid. We\n\nconclude that the Executive Order is invalid because it contradicts the plain language\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s grant of citizenship to \u201call persons born in the\n\nUnited States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\n\nBecause the Individual Plaintiffs are covered by a certified class action in\n\nanother federal court, 1 we decline to exercise jurisdiction over their claims and\n\ndismiss them. But because State Plaintiffs have standing and are likely to succeed\n\nin demonstrating that the Executive Order is unconstitutional, we affirm the district\n\ncourt\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction and its determination that a universal\n\npreliminary injunction is necessary to give the States complete relief on their claims.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n A\n The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted after the Civil War, in order to reject\n\nand refute the holding of Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 403 (1857), which in\n\nsubstance held that slaves and descendants of slaves were not citizens of the United\n\nStates, and \u201cto put citizenship beyond the power of any governmental unit to\n\ndestroy.\u201d Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 263 (1967).\n \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL 1904338 (D. N.H.\nJuly 10, 2025).\n\n3 25-807\n\f When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, whether birthright citizenship\n\napplied to the children of noncitizens was still an open question. But the Supreme\n\nCourt answered that question in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649\n\n(1898). When the case was decided, Chinese nationals in the United States were not\n\npermitted to become citizens. See Chinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, \u00a7 14, 22 Stat. 58,\n\n61 (1882). Chinese laborers could not re-enter the United States if they left. See\n\nScott Act, ch. 1064, 25 Stat. 504 (1888). Chinese laborers were also required to\n\nobtain a certificate of residence, and non-laborer Chinese persons were subject to a\n\nharsh presumption that they were unlawfully present. See Geary Act, ch. 60, 27 Stat.\n\n25 (1892).\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Supreme Court considered the case of Wong Kim\n\nArk, a Chinese-American man who was denied reentry to the United States, despite\n\nbeing born in the United States. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 652\u201353. The Supreme\n\nCourt canvassed English common law, early American decisions, and citizenship\u2019s\n\nmeaning to the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s drafters and then held that the Citizenship\n\nClause stands for \u201cthe fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the dominion\n\nof the United States, notwithstanding alienage of the parents[.]\u201d Id. at 68, 692\u201393.\n\nFor that reason, although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents would have been unable to\n\nnaturalize or even return to the United States, Wong Kim Ark acquired United States\n\ncitizenship \u201cby birth within the United States.\u201d Id. at 704\u201305. Since Wong Kim Ark\n\n4 25-807\n\fwas decided in 1898, and until this challenged Executive Order, the Judiciary,\n\nCongress, and the Executive Branch have consistently and uniformly protected the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s explicit guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the\n\nimmigration status of an individual\u2019s parents.\n\nB\n On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled\n\n\u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d Exec. Order No.\n\n14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). Section 1 of the Executive Order states\n\nin relevant part,\n\nthe privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to\n persons born in the United States:\n (1) when that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United\n States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or\n (2) when that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States at the\n time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited\n to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program\n or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United\n States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth.\n\n90. Fed. Reg. at 8449.\n\nSection 2 states that it is the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d that no federal\n\ndepartment or agency shall issue documents recognizing such persons as United\n\nStates citizens or accept documents issued by state governments recognizing such\n\npersons as citizens if they are born 30 days from the date the Executive Order was\n\nissued. Id.\n\n5 25-807\n\f Section 3 directs the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security, and Commissioner of Social Security to \u201ctake all appropriate\n\nmeasures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments\n\nand agencies are consistent with this order\u201d and mandates that officials cannot \u201cact,\n\nor forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\u201d Id. at 8449\u201350.\n\nC\n The day after the President signed the Executive Order, the States filed a\n\ncomplaint and motion for a temporary restraining order. The district court granted\n\nthe temporary restraining order. Shortly thereafter, the Individual Plaintiffs filed a\n\nputative class action. The district court consolidated the cases, and the States and\n\nIndividual Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Each group of plaintiffs moved\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, the district court granted a preliminary injunction,\n\nenjoining Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Order on a\n\nuniversal basis. The district court concluded that the States had standing and that\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 standing was undisputed. On the merits, the district court\n\nconcluded that the Executive Order likely violates both the Constitution and the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA). The district court also concluded that the\n\nStates would suffer \u201cirreparable economic harm in the absence of preliminary\n\nrelief,\u201d and that the Individual Plaintiffs faced the irreparable harm of \u201cconstitutional\n\ninfringement and the specter of deportation.\u201d Finally, the district court concluded\n\n6 25-807\n\fthat the balance of the equities and public interest strongly weighed in favor of\n\nentering a preliminary injunction, because \u201cthe rule of law is secured by a strong\n\npublic interest that the laws \u2018enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by\n\nexecutive fiat.\u2019\u201d The district court granted a universal injunction after determining\n\nthat a geographically limited injunction would be ineffective to relieve the States\u2019\n\nfinancial and administrative burdens.\n\nAfter the district court granted its injunction, other courts throughout the\n\ncountry also enjoined implementation and enforcement of the Executive Order. See\n\nDoe v. Trump, No. 25-cv-10135, 25-cv-10139, 2025 WL 485070, at *14\u201316 (D.\n\nMass. Feb. 13, 2025) (universal injunction); CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00201,\n\n2025 WL 408636, at *16\u201317 (D. Md. Feb. 2, 2025) (universal injunction); N.H.\n\nIndonesian Cmty. Support v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00038, 2025 WL 457609, at *6 (D.\n\nN.H. Feb. 11, 2025) (injunction \u201cwith respect to any individual or entity . . . within\n\nthe jurisdiction of this court\u201d). The Supreme Court accepted review on the scope of\n\nthe injunction and held that the universal scope of the injunction was impermissible\n\ninsofar as it was based on individual and associational plaintiff standing, leaving\n\nopen the question whether the universal injunction may be justified in order to give\n\ncomplete relief to the appellee States. Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. ____, No.\n\n24A884, 2025 WL 1773631 (June 27, 2025). The district court of New Hampshire\n\nhas since provisionally certified a nationwide class of plaintiffs and issued a\n\n7 25-807\n\fclasswide preliminary injunction, which it stayed until July 17, 2025, pending appeal\n\nin the First Circuit. See \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL\n\n1904338 (D. N.H. July 10, 2025).\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n A district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction, including the injunction\u2019s\n\nscope, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1073\n\n(9th Cir. 2024). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it rests its decision \u2018on an\n\nerroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous factual findings.\u2019\u201d Am. Beverage\n\nAss\u2019n v. City & County of San Francisco, 916 F.3d 749, 754 (9th Cir. 2019) (en\n\nbanc). Legal conclusions are reviewed de novo while factual findings are reviewed\n\nfor clear error. K.W. ex rel. D.W. v. Armstrong, 789 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\nIII. STANDING\n\nBecause a \u201cquestion of appellate jurisdiction must always be resolved before\n\nthe merits of an appeal are examined or addressed,\u201d we first address the questions of\n\nstanding. In re Application for Exemption from Elec. Pub. Access Fees by Jennifer\n\nGollan & Shane Shifflett, 728 F.3d 1033, 1036 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). \u201c[S]tanding must be met by persons seeking appellate\n\nreview, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.\u201d\n\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks and\n\n8 25-807\n\fcitation omitted). \u201cAll that is needed to entertain an appeal\u201d on an issue, however,\n\n\u201cis one party with standing.\u201d Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. 647, 665 (2021).\n\nUnder Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff has standing if\n\nthe plaintiff can show (1) an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is concrete and particularized and\n\nactual or imminent, not hypothetical; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the\n\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely, as opposed to merely\n\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defs.\n\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). Under this general rule, standing requires\n\na showing of injury, causation, and redressability. See id.\n\nA. STATE PLAINTIFFS\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a state has standing to bring suit where the\n\nfederal government\u2019s action directly reduces the number of individuals that a state\n\nentity serves, causing a loss of revenue that the state would have otherwise received\n\nunder an existing federal contract. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 490 (2023);\n\nsee also Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 767\u201368 (2019) (finding standing\n\nwhere the inclusion of a citizenship question was likely to lead to the undercounting\n\nof the states\u2019 populations, and that this undercounting would cause states to lose out\n\non federal funds distributed on the basis of state population); City & Cnty. of San\n\nFrancisco v. United States, 981 F.3d 742, 754 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that states\n\nhad standing to challenge a DHS rule that would render immigrants likely to\n\n9 25-807\n\fparticipate in federal programs inadmissible and ineligible for permanent residence\n\nstatus, thereby decreasing enrollment in public benefits and federal payments to the\n\nstates).\n\nHere, the States contend that the Executive Order would cause them an\n\neconomic injury by defunding and requiring substantial changes to existing public\n\nprograms such as Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title\n\nIV-E foster care, and Social Security Act (SSA)\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program.\n\nThe States have presented evidence that more than 1100 infants born each month in\n\nthe Plaintiff States would be subject to the Executive Order. If those infants are\n\ndenied citizenship, they will be ineligible for federally-backed state-run programs\n\nsuch as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care. States generally do not receive\n\nfederal reimbursements based on services to individuals who do not have a lawful,\n\nqualifying immigration status. The States accordingly allege that they will lose\n\nmillions of dollars of contracted reimbursements that they would otherwise receive.\n\nAlso, federal law requires the States to determine whether each resident served\n\nby federal benefits is eligible. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406. Because current State systems rely on birth\n\ncertificates, place of birth, or Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to determine\n\neligibility, the States contend that they will need to create new systems to determine\n\ncitizenship and maintain compliance with federal law. The States also contend that\n\n10 25-807\n\fthey will lose \u201cadministrative fees\u201d that they would otherwise receive under the\n\nSSA\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program. See Biden, 600 U.S. 489\u201390. State agencies\n\ntransmit birth data to the SSA to facilitate the assignment of SSNs, in exchange for\n\n$4\u20135 per SSN from the SSA. If the SSA no longer issued SSNs to children subject\n\nto the Executive Order, the States expect losses of $7,320\u2013$38,129 per year.\n\nDefendants argue these alleged losses are \u201cincidental downstream economic\n\neffects\u201d that are too indirect to confer standing. Defendants rely on United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023), wherein the Supreme Court stated in a footnote\n\nthat when a state asserts that federal law or policy has only generated indirect effects\n\non state revenues or state spending, \u201cthe State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n\nattenuated.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. Defendants also cite Washington v. FDA, 108 F.4th\n\n1163, 1175\u201376 (9th Cir. 2024), in which we held that a state did not have standing\n\nto challenge the FDA\u2019s elimination of its in-person dispensing requirement for\n\nmifepristone, because the state\u2019s claimed increase in Medicaid costs was too\n\nindirect.\n\nWe conclude that the States have shown that the loss of reimbursements,\n\nfunding, and additional expenses incurred by the development of a new system to\n\ndetermine eligibility are concrete and imminent injuries-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction. We agree with the district court\n\nthat the automatic and direct effect of denying citizenship to children affected by the\n\n11 25-807\n\fExecutive Order renders them ineligible for federal programs and for Social Security\n\nNumbers, which results in a quantifiable loss of funding to the States. Nothing about\n\nthis pecuniary injury is speculative given that it is \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d See\n\nClapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013). These losses are not an\n\n\u201cindirect\u201d effect on state spending that relies on a chain of causation with multiple\n\nlinks, or assumptions about the effects of medication, or the unpredictable actions of\n\nthird parties. Cf. Texas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3; Washington, 108 F.4th at 1175\u201376.\n\nInstead, as in Biden v. Nebraska, the direct effect of the challenged federal action is\n\nto decrease the number of people for which the state will receive federal funding and\n\n\u201cadministrative fees.\u201d 600 U.S. at 477, 489.\n\nDefendants\u2019 contentions to the contrary are not persuasive. They suggest that\n\nany economic losses would be \u201cself-inflicted,\u201d because the State need not provide\n\nsocial services to an individual who is ineligible under the federal program unless\n\nthey so choose. However, it was not a voluntary choice by the States for the federal\n\ngovernment to stop paying for these services, or to assume the costs that follow. See\n\nDep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767 (finding that losing \u201cout on federal funds that are\n\ndistributed on the basis of state population\u201d was a \u201csufficiently concrete and\n\nimminent injury to satisfy Article III\u201d). And the Supreme Court in Biden v.\n\nNebraska found that Missouri had alleged standing, even though its financial injury\n\nstemmed from its choice to service federal loans. See 600 U.S. 489\u2013490.\n\n12 25-807\n\fDefendants also claim that the Executive Order does not require any changes to State\n\nsystems and does not \u201cimpose any penalty for failing to make them.\u201d Although the\n\nExecutive Order does not on its face impose a duty on the States to change their\n\nmethods of determining federal eligibility, the States would nonetheless be required\n\nto make these changes to comply with other federal laws. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406.\n\nDefendants also argue that, even assuming that the States satisfy Article III,\n\nrecognizing standing here would violate the prohibition on parens patriae standing.\n\nA \u201c[s]tate does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the\n\nFederal Government.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458\n\nU.S. 592, 61 n.16 (1982). To be sure, the Supreme Court has denied states\u2019 attempts\n\nto assert third-party standing as \u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on\n\nparens patriae standing.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 n.11 (2023)\n\n(stating that Texas claimed third-party standing \u201con behalf of non-Indian families.\u201d);\n\nsee also Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024).\n\nBut the States here are not asserting standing based on the rights of their\n\ncitizens; instead, they assert injuries to their own pocketbooks that will be caused by\n\nenforcement of the Executive Order. Unlike in Brackeen and Murthy, the asserted\n\npocketbook injuries are concrete, particularized, and traceable. Cf. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. at 295\u201396 (\u201c[T]hese alleged costs are not \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to the placement\n\n13 25-807\n\fpreferences, which \u2018operate independently\u2019 of the provisions Texas identifies.\u201d);\n\nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 75 (\u201cThe States have not identified any specific speakers or\n\ntopics that they have been unable to hear or follow.\u201d).\n\nFinally, Defendants contend that third-party standing limitations also bar\n\nstanding for State plaintiffs. Prudential limitations on federal court jurisdiction\n\ndictate that: (1) a party must assert his or her own legal rights and interests, not those\n\nof others; (2) the courts will not adjudicate \u201cgeneralized grievances\u201d (i.e. \u201cabstract\n\nquestions of wide public significance\u201d); and (3) a party\u2019s claims must fall within\n\n\u201cthe zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\n\nguarantee in question.\u201d See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474\u201375 (1982) (citations omitted);\n\nsee also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) (a plaintiff \u201cmust assert his own\n\nlegal rights and interests\u201d); Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (noting\n\nthat a constitutional claim should be brought by the person \u201cat whom the\n\nconstitutional protection is aimed\u201d). However, \u201c[the Supreme Court] has allowed\n\nstanding to litigate the rights of third parties when enforcement of the challenged\n\nrestriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\u2019\n\nrights.\u201d Warth, 422 U.S. at 510.\n\nWe conclude that third-party standing limitations do not bar this action. The\n\nExecutive Order operates directly as to the States by preventing the States from\n\n14 25-807\n\freceiving funding and administrative fees that they would otherwise receive. In\n\naddition, the Executive Order prohibits departments and agencies of the United\n\nStates from accepting documents issued by State governments purporting to\n\nrecognize United States citizenship for persons subject to the Executive Order. See\n\n90 Fed. Reg. 8449. As a result, if the Executive Order is upheld, States will have to\n\nmodify their methods of determining United States citizenship and eligibility for\n\nfederal programs. The enforcement of the challenged government action against the\n\nStates thus results in the violation of third parties\u2019 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at\n\n510. We conclude that the States have standing to challenge the Executive Order as\n\nviolative of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause.\n\nB. INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS\n\nWe decline to exercise our jurisdiction with respect to the Individual\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 action and dismiss their claims. At the time that this lawsuit was filed,\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs were a group of pregnant women who are noncitizens with\n\npending applications for asylum, representing a putative class of pregnant persons\n\nand future children residing in Washington State. Defendants do not dispute their\n\nstanding. Individual Plaintiffs allege that their children would be denied citizenship\n\nas a result of the Executive Order taking effect, and that that denial of citizenship\n\nwould cause loss to them of various federal benefits. We agree with the district court\n\n15 25-807\n\fthat a denial of citizenship is a concrete and imminent injury-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction.\n\nHowever, one of the Individual Plaintiffs has since given birth while the\n\nExecutive Order is enjoined, meaning that her child is now a citizen, while the other\n\nIndividual Plaintiff was due to give birth earlier this month. Because Defendants\n\nclaim that the Executive Order does not have retroactive effect, if both Individuals\n\nhave given birth before this opinion is published, there may be a question of\n\nmootness as to the Individuals\u2019 claims. Typically, if a district court certifies a class\n\nbefore the class representative\u2019s claim becomes moot, \u201cmooting the putative class\n\nrepresentative\u2019s claim will not moot the class action.\u201d Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc.,\n\n653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011). \u201cBut where, as here, the plaintiff's claim\n\nbecomes moot before the district court certifies the class, the class action normally\n\nalso becomes moot.\u201d Slayman v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., 765 F.3d 1033, 1048\n\n(9th Cir. 2014). Because the district court below did not certify the class, there\n\nremains a question as to whether Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are moot, or whether\n\nan exception to mootness applies. We decline to address that question, because we\n\ndetermine that to the extent the Individual Plaintiffs have live claims, those claims\n\nare covered by the class action certified by the district court of New Hampshire in\n\nBarbara, and dismissal of the Individual Plaintiffs is proper on those grounds. \u201cA\n\ncourt may choose not to exercise its jurisdiction when another court having\n\n16 25-807\n\fjurisdiction over the same matter has entertained it and can achieve the same result.\u201d\n\nCrawford v. Bell, 599 F.2d 890, 893 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nThe district court of New Hampshire certified a class that includes:\n\nAll current and future persons who are born on or after February 20, 2025,\n where (1) that person's mother was unlawfully present in the United States\n and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person's birth, or (2) that person's mother's\n presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's\n father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the\n time of said person's birth.\n\nBarbara, 2025 WL 1904338, at *16. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children undoubtedly are\n\nencompassed by that class definition. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries on\n\nappeal relate to the harm faced by their children: the prospect of removal and\n\nseparation from their families, the exclusion from legal immigration status if not\n\nremoved, the denial of lawful employment and educational opportunities, and the\n\ndeprivation of both constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, both the class\n\ncertified in Barbara and the Individual Plaintiffs here seek an injunction of the\n\nExecutive Order on the basis that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the INA.\n\nSee id. at *1. There is no reason to believe that these claims will not be \u201cfully and\n\nvigorously litigated\u201d by the Barbara class representatives. See Crawford, 599 F.2d\n\nat 893. Because Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children can obtain relief for those injuries\n\nthrough the class certified by the District Court of New Hampshire, and because\n\nrelief in this court may conflict with or circumscribe the flexibility of relief in that\n\n17 25-807\n\fother case, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction over the Individual Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims and proceed only with the State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\nIV. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n A party is only entitled to a preliminary injunction if the party demonstrates\n\n\u201c[1] that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; [2] that [it] is likely to suffer an\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; [3] that the balance of equities\n\ntips in [its] favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter v.\n\nNRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \u201cLikelihood of success on the merits is \u2018the most\n\nimportant\u2019 factor; if a movant fails to meet this \u2018threshold inquiry,\u2019 we need not\n\nconsider the other factors.\u201d California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 575 (2018) (quoting\n\nDisney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation\n\nomitted)). We first consider whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits\n\nof their claims. Upon determining that they are likely to succeed, we then proceed\n\nto consider the remaining prongs of the Winter test.\n\nA. MERITS\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause. They also contend that the Executive Order\n\nviolates the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. We first address whether the Executive Order\n\nviolates the Citizenship Clause.\n\n18 25-807\n\f 1. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThe text of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause explicitly reads:\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside.\u201d U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. The parties dispute the meaning of \u201csubject to the\n\njurisdiction thereof.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the phrase \u201csubject to jurisdiction thereof\u201d means\n\n\u201csubject to United States authority and laws,\u201d and exempts a small and well-defined\n\ngroup of people who are born in United States territory yet not subject to United\n\nStates authority. Because the Executive Order attempts to exempt from citizenship\n\npersons who are both born in the United States and subject to United States authority,\n\nPlaintiffs contend that it violates the Citizenship Clause.\n\nDefendants, in contending that the Executive Order is constitutional, advance\n\na novel interpretation of the phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d They first\n\ncontend that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as used in the Citizenship Clause does not refer to\n\n\u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d i.e., jurisdiction as defined by a government\u2019s authority\n\nand lawmaking power, but instead refers to \u201cpolitical jurisdiction,\u201d which they\n\ndefine as \u201ca concept rooted in allegiance and protection.\u201d By their definition, persons\n\nare only subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States if they \u201cowe primary\n\nallegiance to the United States,\u201d excluding \u201cthose persons [who] owe allegiance to\n\n19 25-807\n\fa different sovereign.\u201d They then contend that a person only owes such allegiance\n\nto the country in which the person is permanently domiciled, and the domicile of a\n\nchild follows the domicile of the parent. They assert that because individuals present\n\ntemporarily or unlawfully in the United States cannot establish permanent domicile,\n\ntheir children born on United States soil do not owe allegiance to the United States\n\nand are not subject to its political jurisdiction.\n\na. Ordinary Meaning\n\nWe conclude that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment supports the\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 interpretation. In interpreting the text of the Constitution, courts are\n\n\u201cguided by the principle that \u2018[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the\n\nvoters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished\n\nfrom technical meaning.\u2019\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 544 U.S. 570, 576 (2008)\n\n(quoting United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 731 (1931)). When the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was adopted, as it is today, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was commonly used in\n\nreference to the power of the courts, defined as \u201c[t]he legal power or authority of\n\nhearing and determining causes.\u201d Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language 732 (1865). But in reference to nations, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was also\n\ndefined as the \u201c[p]ower of governing or legislating; the right of making or enforcing\n\nlaws; the power or right of exercising authority;\u201d and the \u201climit within which power\n\nmay be exercised,\u201d or \u201cextent of power or authority.\u201d Id; see also Benjamin\n\n20 25-807\n\fVaughan Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English\n\nJurisprudence 671 (1879) (defining jurisdiction as \u201c[t]he authority of government;\n\nthe sway of a sovereign power.\u201d). This ordinary meaning of jurisdiction is consistent\n\nwith Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d as subject to the\n\nlaws and authority of the United States.\n\nDefendants point to no contrary dictionary definitions that define jurisdiction\n\nin terms of allegiance and protection. Indeed, they make no arguments about the\n\nordinary meaning of the Citizenship Clause at all. Defendants\u2019 only argument based\n\non the text of the Citizenship Clause is that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d cannot\n\nsimply refer to \u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d because that definition would render the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s requirement of jurisdiction surplusage. They claim that the\n\nUnited States has \u201cexclusive and absolute\u201d regulatory jurisdiction within its\n\nterritory, so that all children born in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction.\n\nId. They further contend that that definition does not explain why certain groups,\n\nsuch as Native Americans and children of diplomats, were excluded from\n\ncitizenship.\n\nSupreme Court precedent makes clear that reading \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof\u201d to mean \u201csubject to United States authority and laws\u201d is not redundant. In\n\nWong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court directly addressed the meaning of the phrase\n\n\u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 169 U.S. 649. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he real\n\n21 25-807\n\fobject of\u201d the dual requirements of birth in U.S. territory and being subject to United\n\nStates jurisdiction was, \u201cto exclude, by the fewest and fittest words, (besides children\n\nof members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National\n\nGovernment, unknown to the common law), the two classes of cases, \u2013 children born\n\nof alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of\n\na foreign State, both of which . . . had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental\n\nrule of citizenship by birth within the country.\u201d Id. at 682.\n\nThe Court in Wong Kim Ark held that these \u201cclasses of cases\u201d are not fully\n\nsubject to United States authority and laws, despite Defendants\u2019 contentions to the\n\ncontrary. The Court, relying on Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in Schooner\n\nExchange, said that while \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is\n\nnecessarily exclusive and absolute,\u201d there are certain cases \u201cin which every\n\nsovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive\n\nterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 683\u2013684 (quoting Schooner Exch. v. McFaddon, 11\n\nU.S. 116, 136 (1812)). When a hostile foreign power occupies United States\n\nterritory, the Court said that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of the United States over the territory\n\n[is], of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be\n\nrightfully enforced there[.]\u201d Id. at 683 (quoting United States v. Rice, 17 U.S. 246,\n\n254 (1819)) (emphasis added). With respect to the immunity of foreign ministers\n\nfrom United States jurisdiction, \u201cthe immunity itself is granted by the governing\n\n22 25-807\n\fpower of the nation to which the minister is deputed.\u201d Id. at 685 (quoting Schooner\n\nExch., 11 U.S. at 138).\n\nThe Court contrasted these two groups with private individuals, who it stated\n\ncannot be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country that they are in, because,\n\nWhen private individuals of one nation spread themselves through another as\n business or caprice may direct . . . it would be obviously inconvenient and\n dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction, and\n the government to degradation, if such individuals or merchants did not owe\n temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of\n the country.\nId. at 685\u201386 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144) (emphasis added). The\n\nCourt\u2019s primary concern, in distinguishing private individuals from the exempted\n\ngroups, was whether they were subject to the laws and enforcement power of the\n\nUnited States. Because the Court in Wong Kim Ark reasoned that the words \u201csubject\n\nto the jurisdiction thereof\u201d must be understood \u201cin the same sense in which the like\n\nwords had been used by Chief Justice Marshall in the well known case of The\n\nExchange,\u201d the Court must have understood the phrase to refer to the United States\u2019s\n\nability to fully subject an individual to its laws. See id. at 687.\n\nThe Court in Elk v. Wilkins similarly exempted members of Indian tribes from\n\ncitizenship because they were not subject to the full regulatory authority of the\n\nUnited States.2 112 U.S. 94 (1884). While the United States could deal with the\n Congress later expanded citizenship to Native American children via statute. See\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(b) (1924).\n\n23 25-807\n\fTribes \u201ceither through treaties made by the President and Senate, or through acts of\n\nCongress in the ordinary forms of legislation,\u201d the Court in Elk recognized that,\n\n\u201c[g]eneral acts of Congress did not apply to Indians, unless so expressed as to clearly\n\nmanifest an intention to include them.\u201d Id. at 100\u201301. This statement reflects the\n\nunique position of the Tribes, which have sovereignty and are not subject to the full\n\nregulatory jurisdiction of the United States. See, e.g., Haaland v. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. 255, 310\u2013313 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (explaining that the Tribes have\n\ninherent sovereignty and are free from state jurisdiction and control).\n\nAccordingly, the Court in Elk said that members of Tribes were no more\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States \u201cthan the children of subjects of any\n\nforeign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born\n\nwithin the United States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign\n\nnations.\u201d 112 U.S. at 102. Regardless, the Court in Wong Kim Ark also held clearly\n\nthat \u201c[t]he decision in Elk v. Wilkins concerned only members of the Indian tribes\n\nwithin the United States, and had no tendency to deny citizenship to children born\n\nin the United States of foreign parents of Caucasian, African, or Mongolian descent,\n\nnot-in the diplomatic service of a foreign country.\u201d 169 U.S. at 682. Because the\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that children of diplomats, children of invading\n\narmies, and children of tribal members were understood not to be fully subject to\n\n24 25-807\n\fUnited States authority and laws, interpreting jurisdiction in accordance with its\n\nordinary meaning is not redundant.\n\nb. Supreme Court Precedent\n\nThe argument that Supreme Court precedent supports Defendants\u2019 reading is\n\nsimilarly unavailing. First, Defendants\u2019 claimed distinction between political\n\njurisdiction and regulatory jurisdiction is not supported by precedent. Both the\n\nSupreme Court and our Court have used \u201cpolitical jurisdiction\u201d to refer merely to\n\nthe United States\u2019 lawmaking authority. See, e.g., Smith v. Turner, 48 U.S. 283, 422\n\n(1849) (describing taxation as part of political jurisdiction); Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry.\n\nCo. v. McGlinn, 114 U.S. 542, 546 (1885) (describing political jurisdiction as\n\ninvolved in legislative power); Lake v. Ohana Mil. Cmtys., LLC, 14 F.4th 993, 1000\u2013\n\n01 (9th Cir. 2021) (equating political jurisdiction with \u201clegislative . . . jurisdiction\u201d).\n\nSecond, the Court did not hold or even hint that there was a requirement of\n\n\u201cprimary allegiance\u201d or exclusive allegiance in either Elk or Wong Kim Ark. To the\n\ncontrary, the Wong Kim Ark Court repeatedly equated allegiance merely with\n\nobedience to the laws of the sovereign, saying that \u201c[a]llegiance is nothing more than\n\nthe tie or duty of obedience of a subject to the sovereign under whose protection he\n\nis . . . .\u201d See, e.g., id. at 659\u2013661 (quoting Inglis v. Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 28 U.S.\n\n99, 155 (1830)). Under English common law, \u201c[s]uch allegiance and protection\n\nwere mutual . . . and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized\n\n25 25-807\n\fsubjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance; but were predicable of\n\naliens in amity, so long as they were within the kingdom.\u201d Id. at 655. Rather than\n\ndescribe this allegiance as primary or exclusive, the Court characterized the\n\nallegiance owed by foreign \u201cindividuals and merchants\u201d as \u201ctemporary and local\u201d\n\nwhich was necessary to avoid \u201csubjecting the laws to continual infraction.\u201d Id. at\n\n685 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144). The context of the opinion makes\n\nclear that the Court did not view allegiance as a separate and unspoken requirement\n\nof jurisdiction. Instead, it considered allegiance to be part and parcel of what\n\nDefendants now label \u201cregulatory\u201d jurisdiction.\n\nThird, the proposed requirement of \u201cpermanent domicile\u201d in order to establish\n\npolitical jurisdiction also finds no basis in the text of the Citizenship Clause or its\n\ninterpreting precedent. The Wong Kim Ark Court uses the phrase \u201cpermanent\u201d only\n\nin connection with domicile once, stating that although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents left\n\nthe United States in 1890, they \u201cwere at the time of his birth domiciled residents of\n\nthe United States, having previously established and still enjoying a permanent\n\ndomicil[e] and residence therein at San Francisco.\u201d Id. at 652. This statement\n\nreflects the stipulated facts of the case, and the Court did not mention \u201cpermanent\u201d\n\ndomicile in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause. See id. at 652 (\u201cThe facts of\n\nthis case, as agreed by the parties are as follows . . . .\u201d).\n\n26 25-807\n\f In its analysis, the Court said, \u201c[e]very citizen or subject of another country,\n\nwhile domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.\u201d Id. at 693. But the Court\n\nimmediately continued:\n\nIt can hardly be denied that an alien is completely subject to the political\n jurisdiction of the country in which he resides\u2014seeing that, as said by Mr.\n Webster, when Secretary of State, in his Report to the President on Thrasher\u2019s\n Case in 1851, and since repeated by this court, \u201cindependently of a residence\n with intention to continue such residence; independently of any domiciliation;\n independently of the taking of any oath of allegiance or of renouncing any\n former allegiance, it is well known that, by the public law, an alien, or a\n stranger born, for so long a time as he continues within the dominions of a\n foreign government, owes obedience to the laws of that government, and may\n be punished for treason, or other crimes, as a native-born subject might be,\n unless his case is varied by some treaty stipulations.\u201d\n\nId. at 693\u201394 (quoting 6 Daniel Webster, The Works of Daniel Webster 526 (1851)\n\n(emphasis added)). It is clear from this quoted passage both that domicile did not\n\nplay a significant role Scientology of Cal. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, 611 F.2d 738, 750 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nBut in rigorously applying our standing doctrine, I conclude that State\n\nPlaintiffs have no standing at this time. Absent a party with Article III standing, it\u2019s\n\npremature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the\n\ninjunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\nI.\n\nState Plaintiffs Lack Standing\n\nThe federal government asserts that the State Plaintiffs lack standing to\n\nchallenge the Executive Order. In response, State Plaintiffs claim standing to protect\n\ntheir sovereign and pecuniary interests. Neither ground establishes standing. First,\n\nState Plaintiffs haven\u2019t identified a cognizable sovereign interest, and they can\u2019t sue\n\nthe federal government on behalf of their citizens. Second, State Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted\n\fpecuniary injuries are too speculative and contingent at this stage to constitute\n\ninjuries in fact. Third, State Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged loss of federal reimbursements for\n\npublic benefits is a self-inflicted injury that doesn\u2019t confer standing. Finally, Biden\n\nv. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477 (2023), doesn\u2019t provide standing.\n\nA.\n\nNo Sovereign or Third-Party Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs first argue standing to bring this challenge based on their\n\n\u201csovereign interests\u201d or their ability to litigate constitutional claims that implicate\n\ntheir residents\u2019 individual rights.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory of standing is easy to dismiss. They assert a\n\n\u201csovereign interest\u201d in defending against regulation of \u201cstate citizenship.\u201d Even if\n\nsuch an interest exists, State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown how the Executive Order\n\nregulates state citizenship in any way. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447,\n\n482 (1923) (observing that States\u2019 \u201csovereign rights\u201d are not implicated if the federal\n\ngovernment does not \u201crequire the states to do or to yield anything\u201d). By its express\n\nterms, the Order only implicates the meaning of United States citizenship and only\n\ndirects action by federal executive agencies. And State Plaintiffs point to no\n\nlanguage in the Order that implicitly alters state citizenship. At most, they suggest\n\nthat deeming some of their residents not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United\n\nStates might confer on those residents \u201csome degree of immunity from state laws.\u201d\n\fAbsolutely nothing in the Executive Order says that, nor has any party advanced that\n\nview. So, while creative, this alleged injury is neither concrete nor imminent. This\n\ntheory easily fails.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 next theory of standing seeks to vindicate the rights of their\n\ncitizens. Altering who is a United States citizen, they assert, might affect their\n\nresidents\u2019 ability to vote in local elections, serve on juries, hold local office, and\n\nbecome police officers. They also argue that they can challenge the Order based on\n\na \u201clong history\u201d of state and local government challenges to Executive Branch action\n\nimpacting individual rights. Try as they may to disclaim it, distilled down, these\n\narguments are no more than an assertion of third-party standing on behalf of their\n\ncitizens\u2014also known as parens patriae. And it\u2019s blackletter law that \u201c[a] State does\n\nnot have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal\n\nGovernment.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 (2023) (simplified). That\n\nmakes \u201cth[is] issue open and shut.\u201d Id.\n\nStanding doctrine \u201cstrongly disfavors so\u2011called \u2018third\u2011party standing.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliam Baude & Samuel L. Bray, Proper Parties, Proper Relief, 137 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n153, 157 (2023). Generally, a party \u201cmust assert his own legal rights and interests,\n\nand cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201d\n\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (simplified). The risks of relaxing\n\nthird-party standing are obvious: \u201cthe courts might be \u2018called upon to decide abstract\n\fquestions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions\n\nmay be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial\n\nintervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\nGiven large state populations and the broad interests they may seek to\n\nvindicate, these concerns apply with greater force when States assert third-party\n\nstanding. Just as federal courts are not \u201croving commissions assigned to pass\n\njudgment on the validity of the Nation\u2019s laws,\u201d Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas,\n\nJ., concurring) (simplified), neither are States anointed privileged litigants to\n\nchallenge disfavored federal government action. Like other parties, States must\n\nshow a cognizable harm to themselves\u2014not just their residents\u2014before invoking\n\nfederal court jurisdiction to challenge federal government policy. As the Court\n\nrecognized long ago, \u201c[w]hile the state, under some circumstances, may sue [as\n\nrepresentatives of its citizens] for the protection of its citizens . . . it is no part of its\n\nduty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal\n\ngovernment.\u201d Mellon, 262 U.S. at 485\u201386. That\u2019s because \u201cit is the United States,\n\nand not the state, which represents them as parens patriae.\u201d Id. at 486.\n\nIndeed, in our constitutional system, the People are sovereign and do not need\n\nStates to act as intermediaries. See Ann Woolhandler & Michael G. Collins, State\n\nStanding, 81 Va. L. Rev. 387, 439 (1995) (arguing that the traditional \u201cpreference\n\nfor state-versus-individual actions over government-versus-government actions\n\fenhanced the status of the individual as a rights-holder against government\u201d);\n\nKowalski, 543 U.S. at 130 (considering \u201cwhether there is a \u2018hindrance\u2019 to the\n\npossessor\u2019s ability to protect his own interests\u201d when deciding whether to allow\n\nthird-party standing). After all, the common law basis for parens patriae was the\n\nneed to protect those who could not protect themselves. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son,\n\nInc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 600 (1982) (The royal prerogative\n\nserves to protect those who \u201care legally unable, on account of mental incapacity,\n\nwhether it proceed from 1st. nonage: 2. idiocy: or 3. lunacy: to take proper care of\n\nthemselves and their property.\u201d) (quoting \ufffd J. Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown 155\n\n(1820)); 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries 47 (The King \u201cis the general guardian\n\nof all infants, idiots, and lunatics.\u201d). Because our constitutional system enables\n\nindividuals to vindicate their own rights, courts should disfavor state third-party\n\nstanding.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a long history of upholding this principle. In South\n\nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), the Court held that South Carolina\n\nlacked standing to challenge a federal statute that the State alleged violated its\n\ncitizens\u2019 due-process rights. Because the State itself had no due process rights, it\n\ncould not raise its citizens\u2019 rights \u201cagainst the Federal Government, the ultimate\n\nparens patriae of every American citizen.\u201d Id. at 324. Next, in Brackeen, 599 U.S.\n\n255, the Supreme Court held that Texas did not have standing to argue that a federal\n\fstatute violated its citizens\u2019 equal-protection rights. Again, the Court held that a\n\nState could not \u201cassert third-party standing\u201d to bring a suit when the State itself\n\n\u201cha[d] no equal protection rights of its own.\u201d Id. at 294, 295 n.11. And most\n\nrecently, in Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024), the Court held that Missouri\n\nlacked standing to bring First Amendment claims against alleged federal government\n\ncensorship of its citizens on behalf of its citizens.\n\nSo State Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of standing to protect their residents collides with\n\nthird-party standing limitations. Though they couch it otherwise, we can\u2019t ignore\n\n\u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on parens patriae standing.\u201d\n\nBrackeen, 599 U.S. at 295 n.11. At bottom, State Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are their\n\nresidents\u2019 rights and relationships with the federal government. But as the numerous\n\nsuits filed by individual plaintiffs nationwide against the Executive Order show,\n\nindividuals are themselves capable of remedying any alleged injury. Given this, we\n\nmust deny third-party standing for State Plaintiffs.\n\nB.\n\nPecuniary Injuries Too Speculative and Contingent\n\nState Plaintiffs next assert an array of pecuniary harms to their fiscs. First,\n\nthey claim that the Executive Order will reduce their share of federal reimbursements\n\nfrom Medicaid, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d), and Title IV-E\n\nfoster care services. Because only services provided to those with U.S. citizenship\n\for certain legal immigration statuses are eligible for reimbursement under these\n\nfederal programs, State Plaintiffs allege that they will not receive reimbursements\n\nfor services provided to children born to undocumented aliens or aliens with\n\ntemporary visas. Second, the States maintain that they will incur administrative\n\nexpenses to redesign their public assistance programs and retrain their staff to verify\n\ncitizenship under the Executive Order. If citizenship is no longer determined by\n\nbirth in the United States, State Plaintiffs surmise that they will need to design new\n\ncitizen-verification protocols, update their IT infrastructure, and instruct staff to\n\nensure compliance with federal assistance programs. Finally, the States contend that\n\nthey will lose processing fees from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) for\n\ntransmitting birth-record data on U.S. citizens. Currently, the SSA pays State\n\nPlaintiffs $4 to $5 in service fees for the data, which the agency uses to generate\n\nSocial Security numbers. State Plaintiffs fear they will stop receiving this funding\n\nbecause some children born in their States will no longer be citizens under the\n\nExecutive Order.\n\nBut all these projected injuries suffer the same fatal defect. Because they sit\n\ndownstream of the Executive Order\u2019s direct effects, they rely on speculation about\n\nhow the Order might be implemented and assumptions about how independent third\n\nparties might react to its implementation. But \u201c[a]ny prediction how the Executive\n\nBranch might eventually implement\u201d the Executive Order is \u201cno more than\n\fconjecture.\u201d Trump v. New York, 592 U.S. 125, 131 (2020) (simplified). And so this\n\ncase \u201cdoes not\u2014at this time\u2014present a dispute appropriately resolved through the\n\njudicial process.\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\n1.\n\nAs stated above, we must rigorously enforce our Article III jurisdictional rules\n\nwhen asked to interfere with the actions of the political branches. \u201cA foundational\n\nprinciple of Article III is that \u2018an actual controversy must exist not only at the time\n\nthe complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified). So\n\nplaintiffs must satisfy \u201c[t]wo related doctrines of justiciability\u201d\u2014standing and\n\nripeness\u2014to advance an Article III case or controversy. Id.\n\nFirst, to show standing, plaintiffs must establish an injury in fact, causation,\n\nand redressability. Speculation can\u2019t be used to satisfy these requirements. The\n\ninjury in fact must be \u201cconcrete, particularized, and imminent rather than conjectural\n\nor hypothetical.\u201d Id. (simplified). Alleged injuries must be \u201cimpending\u201d with some\n\n\u201ccertain[ty];\u201d the mere \u201cpossibl[ility]\u201d of \u201cfuture injury\u201d is \u201ctoo speculative for\n\nArticle III purposes.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (simplified). And the causation\n\nrequirement \u201crules out\u201d standing based on \u201cattenuated links,\u201d such as \u201cwhere the\n\ngovernment action is so far removed from its distant (even if predictable) ripple\n\neffects that the plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing.\u201d FDA v. All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 383 (2024). So \u201cPlaintiffs cannot rely on\n\fspeculation about \u2018the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the\n\ncourts\u2019\u201d to claim standing. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5 (simplified). The bottom\n\nline\u2014any asserted injury can\u2019t be \u201ctoo speculative or too attenuated.\u201d All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs must show the case is \u201cripe\u201d for judicial intervention. A\n\nclaim that hinges on \u201ccontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or\n\nindeed may not occur at all\u201d is \u201cnot ripe for adjudication.\u201d Texas v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (simplified). When challenging federal actions, courts\n\noften defer review until a concrete controversy crystallizes. That\u2019s because\n\n\u201c[d]etermination of the scope\u201d of a federal action \u201cin advance of its immediate\n\nadverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an\n\ninquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &\n\nWarehousemen\u2019s Union, Loc. 37 v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224 (1954). This is\n\nespecially so when a case \u201crequire[s] guesswork as to how independent\n\ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 413.\n\n2.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of pecuniary injuries are \u201criddled with\n\ncontingencies and speculation.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 131. Their theory of standing\n\nrequires us to swallow two big pills\u2014(1) state standing based on speculative\n\nassumptions about the indirect, downstream costs of federal government action; and\n\f(2) state standing based on predictions about how a federal policy might be\n\nimplemented. Together, these concerns doom jurisdiction.\n\na.\n\nTo begin, the Executive Order itself doesn\u2019t directly withhold funding to the\n\nStates or require the States to expend any funds. And we should be skeptical of state\n\nchallenges to executive action premised on indirect fiscal effects. As the Court\n\nrecently told us:\n\n[I]n our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies\n frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\n And when a State asserts . . . that a federal law has produced only those\n kinds of indirect effects, the State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n attenuated.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3.\n\nIn Texas, Texas and Louisiana advanced the same derivative-costs theory that\n\nState Plaintiffs make here. The two States challenged new Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (\u201cDHS\u201d) Guidelines prioritizing the arrest of only certain undocumented\n\naliens. See id. at 673\u201374. To establish standing, they claimed that leaving more\n\nundocumented aliens within their borders would force them to spend \u201cmore money\n\non law enforcement, incarceration, and social services.\u201d Id. at 687 (Gorsuch, J.,\n\nconcurring). Even crediting those factual assertions, the Court found the alleged\n\ninjury \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d to support state standing. See id. at 680 n.3. After all,\n\fcontingent injuries, like those based on economic harms tied to predicted population\n\nchanges, will seldom amount to a cognizable Article III injury.\n\nAs Chief Judge Sutton asked in a similar context:\n\nAre we really going to say that any federal regulation of individuals\n through a policy statement that imposes peripheral costs on a State\n creates a cognizable Article III injury for the State to vindicate in\n federal court? If so, what limits on state standing remain? Even though\n it \u201cwould make a mockery . . . of the constitutional requirement of case\n or controversy,\u201d the States\u2019 boundless theory of standing\u2014in which all\n peripheral costs imposed on States by actions of the President create a\n cognizable Article III injury\u2014would allow them to challenge a\n \u201cdisagreeable war.\u201d Alexander Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966\n Sup. Ct. Rev. 79, 89\u201390 (1966). That is a bridge much too far.\n\nArizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J.) (simplified).\n\nTo Chief Judge Sutton\u2019s concerns, I add my own. Taken to its logical\n\nendpoint, the States\u2019 theory would grant them standing to contest virtually any\n\nfederal action that might tangentially affect who lives or is born within their borders.\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to State Plaintiffs, every person who crosses their borders\n\nrepresents a monetary cost or benefit on their financial ledgers. Consider some\n\nexamples. If the President were to raise the annual refugee cap\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because the presence of more aliens might someday increase state\n\nexpenditures on schools or emergency medical care? Or if Congress were to permit\n\nnationwide over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because easier access could depress future birth rates, and thereby\n\nreduce the accompanying SSA administrative fees? Indeed, why wouldn\u2019t a State\n\fhave standing to challenge the removal of a single alien from within its borders given\n\nthe individual\u2019s potential fiscal impact on the State? The Constitution\u2019s case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement does not stretch so thin.\n\nIf bare conjecture that a federal action might marginally alter a State\u2019s\n\npopulation\u2014and thereby its finances\u2014were sufficient for standing, the injury-in-\n\nfact prerequisite would mean little. States would be empowered to litigate every\n\nnational policy dispute under the guise of protecting their treasuries. Merely by\n\nhypothesizing downstream fiscal effects, States could enjoy near-automatic access\n\nto federal court while other litigants face exacting hurdles. Such asymmetry\n\nthreatens to convert States into de facto \u201cgeneral-public-interest plaintiffs,\u201d drawing\n\nArticle III courts into political contests we were never meant to referee. Ann\n\nWoolhandler & Michael G. Collins, Reining in State Standing, 94 Notre Dame L.\n\nRev. 2015, 2030 (2019). At a minimum, we should require costs to state treasuries\n\nto be \u201cdirectly traceable\u201d to the federal government action to establish standing.\n\nBiden, 600 U.S. at 490.\n\nb.\n\nBut these indirect effects aren\u2019t the end of the story. Because the Executive\n\nOrder was essentially enjoined on day one, we don\u2019t know how it will actually be\n\nimplemented. The Executive Order directs federal agencies to \u201cissue public\n\nguidance\u201d within 30 days \u201cregarding this order\u2019s implementation with respect to\n\ftheir operations and activities.\u201d But the district court immediately enjoined any\n\nfederal agency from \u201c[t]aking any further steps in reliance on the Executive Order,\u201d\n\nincluding providing any implementation guidance. Thus, nothing indicates the\n\ngovernment\u2019s plan for enforcing the Order, and any prediction as to how it will do\n\nso is merely a guess.\n\nCourts are often reluctant to recognize standing or ripeness when a\n\ngovernment action is challenged too soon to understand its consequences. See, e.g.,\n\nTrump, 592 U.S. at 132\u201334; Missouri ex rel. Koster v. Harris, 847 F.3d 646, 653 (9th\n\nCir. 2017) (concluding that \u201callegations about the potential economic effects\u201d of a\n\nlaw yet to be implemented \u201cwere necessarily speculative\u201d). Predicting how a\n\npresidential parchment setting a policy goal transforms into the mechanics of actual\n\ngovernment policy \u201cinvolves a significant degree of guesswork.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S.\n\nat 132. Given that the government will eventually need to consider \u201cboth legal and\n\npractical constraints, making any prediction about future injury just that\u2014a\n\nprediction.\u201d Id. at 133. Recognizing standing and ripeness based on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries risks premature interpretation of federal policy on a barebones\n\nrecord.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries depend on discretionary decisions that have\n\nyet to be made, and so any assessment of their claims to standing can only be made\n\nafter further development. Allowing \u201cthe Executive Branch\u2019s decisionmaking\n\fprocess [to] run its course\u201d would \u201cbring[] more manageable proportions to the\n\nscope of the parties\u2019 dispute,\u201d and supply the clarity essential to our review. Id. at\n\n134 (simplified). Rather than breeze past our constitutional limits to get to the\n\nmerits, all this uncertainty requires restraint. Simply, that the Executive Order could\n\nbe administered in a way that harms State Plaintiffs does not establish that it will be\n\nso administered. Nothing prevents the federal government from adopting measures\n\nthat would reduce or eliminate any projected costs to the States. But until those\n\ndiscretionary choices are made, State Plaintiffs\u2019 purported injuries remain \u201ctoo\n\nspeculative\u201d and \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383. So\n\nArticle III demands we wait until the federal government provides its plans before\n\nacting. If State Plaintiffs\u2019 fears become concrete after implementation is announced,\n\nfederal courts will stand ready to fulfill their constitutional duty.\n\n* * *\n\nBased on these twin concerns\u2014speculation on indirect, downstream costs and\n\nassumptions about uncertain implementation\u2014judicial intervention at this stage is\n\npremature.\n\n3.\n\nDrilling down more closely on State Plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations confirms\n\nthat they are, at this time, too speculative and too contingent.\n\f State Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of fiscal injury begins from the premise that every child\n\ndenied citizenship under the Executive Order will likewise be categorically barred\n\nfrom Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care benefits. But the Executive Order\u2019s\n\n\u201cimpact on funding is [un]certain.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 133. Each of these federal\n\nprograms extends not exclusively to U.S. citizens, but also to certain \u201cqualified\n\naliens.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(b). The Executive Order itself is silent on what\n\nimmigration status these children would receive. If they are granted lawful\n\npermanent residence, parole, or another qualifying status, the federal benefits\u2014and\n\nthe accompanying federal reimbursements\u2014could remain available. See id. State\n\nPlaintiffs also presuppose, again without support, that the federal government will\n\nwithhold every dollar of matching funds, that no other appropriations or grants will\n\noffset the difference, and that private social-service groups will not fill any gaps in\n\ncoverage.\n\nThus, the Executive Order \u201cwill not inexorably have the direct effect on\n\ndownstream access to funds or other resources predicted by\u201d State Plaintiffs. Trump,\n\n592 U.S. at 133. How the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d),\n\nDHS, and other federal agencies will address these issues is a \u201cfundamental\n\nuncertainty impeding proper judicial consideration at this time.\u201d Id.\n\nNor do State Plaintiffs identify any evidence that federal agencies will\n\nimplement the Executive Order in the maximally punitive fashion they predict.\n\fWashington, for example, suggests without evidence that it will lose pregnancy-care\n\nreimbursements for undocumented women whose newborns will lack citizenship.\n\nThat is merely a guess.\n\nState Plaintiffs also rely on demographic assumptions to allege these\n\npecuniary harms. They assume that the population of undocumented aliens in their\n\nStates will remain constant, that families will not relocate or repatriate, and that they\n\nwill seek coverage under the specified state programs. Whether any of this occurs\n\nturns on a morass of independent variables, including interstate migration patterns,\n\neconomic cycles, immigration enforcement policies, future congressional\n\nappropriations, and the discretionary policy choices of state, local, and federal\n\ngovernments.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of \u201cadministrative burdens\u201d fares no better. It depends\n\non a string of unsupported predictions: that HHS, SSA, and other relevant agencies\n\nwill immediately rewrite eligibility regulations, refuse to grandfather existing\n\nprocesses, mandate immediate and costly system overhauls, and deny both\n\ntransitional funding and phased\u2011compliance periods. Yet federal agencies possess\n\nample discretion to soften any new requirements\u2014by staggering effective dates,\n\nsupplying technical assistance, or fully subsidizing implementation\u2014and the record\n\ncontains no indication that they will choose the most onerous path. In any event,\n\nbecause the Executive Order by itself doesn\u2019t direct States to alter their verification\n\fsystems, the expenses State Plaintiffs might elect to incur at this stage are \u201cat least\n\npartly within [their] own control,\u201d and are neither imminent nor unavoidable. Lujan\n\nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992).\n\nFinally, State Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed loss of Social Security processing fees rests\n\non still another unsupported chain of speculation: that SSA will bar newborns\n\nwithout U.S. citizenship from receiving Social Security numbers, that SSA will see\n\nno value in continuing to receive the data supplied by State Plaintiffs, and that SSA\n\nwill withhold the processing fee. State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown that SSA will refuse\n\nto either assign Social Security numbers to non-U.S. citizens or compensate States\n\nfor transmitting birth-record data regardless of citizenship. See, e.g.,\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.104(a).\n\nAll this is too speculative and contingent to support jurisdiction over State\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim at this stage. Article III doesn\u2019t give courts license to game out\n\n\u201cwhat-ifs\u201d or to indulge worst-case scenarios. State Plaintiffs\u2019 fiscal projections rest\n\non a chain of speculative assumptions\u2014hypothesizing the most punishing\n\nimplementation to inflict maximum financial loss. In short, every fiscal injury that\n\nState Plaintiffs project depends on compounded assumptions about how multiple\n\nindependent actors\u2014federal agencies, healthcare administrators, private social\n\nservices, and even individual parents\u2014might respond to the Executive Order. The\n\nalleged harms don\u2019t flow from the Executive Order \u201cin the abstract,\u201d but rather from\n\fwhatever measures the federal agencies may eventually adopt to implement its\n\ndirective. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009). This is\n\ninsufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\n\nRigorous enforcement of the Article III requirement is indispensable. Without\n\nit, federal courts would become a forum for any parties to air generalized grievances.\n\nEven worse, federal judges would be transformed into \u201cvirtually continuing\n\nmonitors of the wisdom and soundness\u201d of federal government action. Allen v.\n\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 760 (1984) (simplified).\n\nC.\n\nAny Lost Reimbursement Would Be Self-Inflicted\n\nIn addition to being too speculative and contingent, any loss of federal\n\nreimbursements for state assistance programs would not give rise to Article III\n\nstanding because it would be a \u201cself-inflicted injur[y]\u201d\u2014\u201cnot fairly traceable to the\n\n[federal government\u2019s] purported activities.\u201d See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 418. Even\n\nif losses in federal reimbursements were to come to fruition, they would be caused\n\nby State Plaintiffs\u2019 own voluntary choices to extend benefits to aliens ineligible to\n\nreceive federal benefits. Simply, the \u201cunilateral decision[] by a group of States\u201d to\n\nextend healthcare and other benefits to those not entitled to federal reimbursement\n\ndoes not create a basis to attack the Executive Order because any \u201cfinancial injury\u201d\n\nsuffered would be \u201cdue to their own independent\u201d decisions. FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S.\n\f289, 297 (2022). After all, State Plaintiffs \u201ccannot manufacture standing merely by\n\ninflicting harm on themselves[.]\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416.\n\nPennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 (1976), tells federal courts to guard\n\nagainst self-inflicted injuries by States. In that case, Pennsylvania gave its residents\n\ntax credits for taxes paid to other States. In turn, New Jersey taxed income earned\n\nby Pennsylvanians in New Jersey. The result\u2014Pennsylvania lost tax revenue\n\nbecause of New Jersey\u2019s tax. Id. at 662\u201363. Pennsylvania then sued New Jersey.\n\nThe Court wasn\u2019t sympathetic to Pennsylvania. \u201c[N]othing prevent[ed]\n\nPennsylvania from withdrawing [its tax] credit for taxes [its residents] paid to\n\nNew Jersey,\u201d according to the Court. Id. at 664. Thus, the \u201cinjuries to the [State\u2019s]\n\nfisc[] were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by the[] . . . state legislature[].\u201d\n\nId. So when a State can avoid lost revenue by changing its tax laws, that State lacks\n\nstanding to recoup the funds. Although Pennsylvania was a matter of original\n\njurisdiction, the Court later made clear its principle also applies to Article III\n\nstanding. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297.\n\nState Plaintiffs complain that the Executive Order will cause them to lose\n\nfederal reimbursement for their social assistance programs. They identify several\n\nstate-funded programs\u2014such as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care\u2014which\n\nthey say will be underfunded because of the Executive Order. But any unreimbursed\n\fexpenditures would be the result of the States\u2019 choices to offer services to those\n\nineligible for reimbursement\u2014not the Executive Order.\n\nTake Washington\u2019s \u201cApple Health\u201d program. Apple Health is the umbrella\n\nname for Washington\u2019s medical assistance programs, which include the state-run\n\nside of Medicaid and CHIP. Both federal programs reimburse States a certain\n\npercentage of funds used to cover qualifying healthcare expenses. Historically, the\n\nCHIP federal match has been about 65%. Under federal law, with some limited\n\nexceptions, illegal aliens and those without a qualifying immigration status are not\n\neligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or other federal benefits. So federal reimbursement is\n\ncontingent on U.S. citizenship or another qualifying immigration status, such as\n\nbeing a legal permanent resident. Despite those restrictions on federal\n\nreimbursement, Washington decided to provide healthcare coverage to income-\n\nqualified children \u201cregardless of immigration status.\u201d So while citizenship or lawful\n\nimmigration status is a prerequisite for Medicaid or CHIP reimbursement,\n\nWashington volunteers to cover all children\u2014even if they do not meet the\n\n\u201cimmigration status requirements\u201d for federal reimbursement.\n\nThis is a classic self-inflicted loss. Washington\u2019s theory of injury is that the\n\nExecutive Order will lead to more non-U.S. citizens residing in the State, that the\n\nState will need to provide healthcare benefits for those aliens, and that the federal\n\ngovernment will refuse to reimburse the State for those benefits. But the decision\n\fto provide coverage to individuals regardless of immigration status was\n\nWashington\u2019s alone. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 74.09.470. Indeed, just last year, in\n\n2024, Washington chose to expand its medical assistance programs to\n\nundocumented adults. See 2023\u201325 Supplemental Operating Budget, ch. 376,\n\n\u00a7 211(82)(a), 2024 Wash. Laws 1, 338\u201339. Presumably, State Plaintiffs would argue\n\nthat this brand new policy decision exacerbates their alleged injury.\n\nThough States may extend their assistance programs to anyone they like, the\n\nfederal government\u2019s refusal to reimburse them for a voluntary policy decision\n\nwould not create a cognizable injury. Put differently, had Washington not\n\nindependently chosen to cover undocumented aliens\u2019 healthcare expenses, then the\n\nExecutive Order would not impact Washington\u2019s reimbursements at all. The federal\n\ngovernment would continue to provide reimbursements for those who qualify. That\n\nthe State elects to service residents beyond those who qualify for federal\n\nreimbursement makes its alleged injury directly traceable to Washington State\u2014not\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nUltimately, \u201c[n]othing in the challenged [Executive Order] required the\n\nplaintiff States to offer [expanded healthcare benefits]; accordingly, the financial\n\ninjury those States [allege they will suffer is] due to their own independent\u201d funding\n\ndecisions\u2014not the Executive Order. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297 (citing\n\fPennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664). And \u201c[n]o State can be heard to complain about\n\ndamage inflicted by its own hand.\u201d Pennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664.\n\nD.\n\nBiden v. Nebraska Doesn\u2019t Confer Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs rely chiefly on Biden v. Nebraska to conclude that their\n\nasserted pecuniary injuries support standing. They cite the case for the proposition\n\nthat when the federal government cuts the number of accounts a state entity serves\u2014\n\nand thereby decreases the federal funding or administrative fees to which the State\n\nwould otherwise be entitled under a contract or grant\u2014the federal government\n\ncauses the State to suffer a concrete and direct injury. That may be a fine abstract of\n\nBiden, but it\u2019s far afield from the derivative injuries State Plaintiffs assert here.\n\nSimply put, the alleged harms in Biden were the direct and inescapable result of\n\nfederal action and were in no way speculative or contingent.\n\nBiden arose from the federal government\u2019s attempt to forgive a wide swath of\n\nstudent loans. See Biden, 600 U.S. at 487\u201389. In August 2022, the Department of\n\nEducation announced that it was issuing \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d under the\n\nHigher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. See id. at 487. As\n\nit turned out, these \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d amounted to a plan to forgive a\n\nmonumental sum of student debt. See id. The plan was \u201cstraightforward\u201d\u2014\n\nborrowers with incomes below $125,000 would have their loans discharged up to\n\f$10,000 per borrower. Id. at 488. Estimates projected 43 million borrowers eligible\n\nfor relief and cancellation of about $430 billion in debt principal. Id.\n\nThat impending loan cancellation set off alarm bells for Missouri. Years\n\nbefore, Missouri had created the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority\n\n(\u201cMOHELA\u201d), an instrumentality of the State, to hold and service student loans. See\n\nid. at 488\u201389, 490\u201391. MOHELA owned over $1 billion of loans. See id. at 489.\n\nFurther, it had contracted with the federal government to service nearly $150 billion\n\nof federal loans\u2014meaning that MOHELA would collect payments on those loans\n\nand provide customer service to borrowers. See id. This was good business for\n\nMOHELA, which received $88.9 million in administrative fees for the five million\n\nfederal accounts it serviced. Id. at 489\u201390. The loan-forgiveness plan would have\n\ncompletely discharged \u201croughly half of all federal borrowers\u201d\u2014meaning\n\n\u201cMOHELA could no longer service those closed accounts.\u201d Id. at 490. So if the\n\nloan-forgiveness plan took effect, MOHELA would lose \u201c$44 million a year in fees\n\nthat it otherwise would have earned under its contract with the Department of\n\nEducation.\u201d Id. That \u201cfinancial harm [was] an injury in fact directly traceable to the\n\nSecretary\u2019s plan.\u201d Id.\n\nThe alleged injuries in Biden were certain and direct, not speculative or\n\ncontingent. Because the \u201cterms of the debt cancellation plan [were]\n\nstraightforward,\u201d there was no way MOHELA could escape unscathed\u2014it was\n\fgoing to lose $44 million a year as a direct result of the plan. Id. at 488, 490. That\u2019s\n\nnot the case here. As discussed above, it\u2019s speculative what effect the Executive\n\nOrder will have on the reimbursement and administration of Medicaid, CHIP, and\n\nTitle IV-E programs. Any fiscal impact would only be derivative of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s implementation. And since the preliminary injunction went into effect\n\nbefore the government had an opportunity to sketch out the specifics of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s enforcement, a real possibility exists that the federal government may\n\nmitigate any downstream consequences affecting these assistance programs. The\n\nsame goes for the SSA\u2019s processing fees. Nothing stops the federal government from\n\ncontinuing to collect birth data from the States or from continuing to pay processing\n\nfees. On these contingent questions, the Executive Order is silent. So the Executive\n\nOrder by itself doesn\u2019t command that States lose future downstream payments or\n\npayouts.\n\nThus, while Biden supports the proposition that the loss of federal funding or\n\nadministrative fees can be a \u201cdirect\u201d injury for standing purposes, that principle begs\n\nthe question of whether such a loss will occur at all. The more indirect and\n\nderivative the costs, the more those injuries become speculative and contingent.\n\nPicture it this way, a scraped knee is the predictable\u2014and maybe even likely\u2014\n\nconsequence of riding a skateboard. And once a child falls from his skateboard and\n\nbloodies his knees, that child has suffered a \u201cdirect injury.\u201d But no one would say\n\fthat the child was \u201cinjured\u201d as soon as his parents gifted him the skateboard\u2014no\n\nmatter how predictable the injury may have been. Likewise, the speculative and\n\ncontingent consequences of the Executive Order on federal funding and\n\nadministrative fees is worlds apart from the \u201cstraightforward\u201d terms of the\n\ncancellation plan in Biden\u2014which clearly would have discharged \u201croughly half\u201d of\n\nthe loans MOHELA serviced. Id. at 488, 490. In short, Biden does not control this\n\ncase because that case had nothing to do with Article III\u2019s bar on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries.\n\nII.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t have jurisdiction to review State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims at this\n\ntime, I do not address their merits or the scope of the district court\u2019s injunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\n30"

Prior to trial, Ortiz-Rodriguez moved to\ndismiss his indictment by collaterally attacking his 2017 deportation order\nunder 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). The district court denied his motion.\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 2 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nOn appeal, Ortiz-Rodriguez argues that he satisfied \u00a7 1326(d) because\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings involved an unknowing and\ninvoluntary waiver of judicial review and violated his due process rights by\nerroneously determining that he had committed an aggravated felony. We\ndisagree, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n I\n Ortiz-Rodriguez is not a citizen of the United States but has lived in\nthe United States for most of his life. In February 2017, Ortiz-Rodriguez\npleaded guilty in Texas state court to \u201cEvading Arrest or Detention\u201d with a\nvehicle, a third-degree felony. 1 Ortiz-Rodriguez was sentenced to two years\nof imprisonment, but before his sentence ended, DHS began expedited\nremoval proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). In October 2017, DHS\nagents served Ortiz-Rodriguez with a \u201cNotice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order\u201d (also known as a \u201cNotice of Intent\u201d or \u201cI-\n851\u201d), which informed him that he was deportable because his evading-arrest\nconviction qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\n In addition to summarizing the expedited removal procedures, 2 the\nform notified Ortiz-Rodriguez that he could be represented by counsel (at his\nown expense), explained that he had the right to file a petition for review of\nthe order in a United States Court of Appeals, and provided checkboxes\nwhere Ortiz-Rodriguez could contest his deportability or request withholding\nof removal on various grounds. The form is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix. 3\n\n_____________________\n See Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 38.04.\n See also Valdiviez-Hernandez v.

Ortiz-Rodriguez also affixed his signature and\nprinted his name within another section, beneath three checked boxes, which\nstated:\n [(1)] I Do Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding\n of Removal[,] [which was the heading of the section and was in\n bold font.]\n [(2)] I admit the allegations and charge in this Notice of Intent.\n I admit that I am deportable and acknowledge that I am not\n eligible for any form of relief from removal. I waive my right to\n rebut and contest the above charges. I do not wish to request\n withholding or deferral of removal. I wish to be removed to\n Mexico[.] [\u201cMexico\u201d was handwritten.]\n [(3)] I understand that I have the right to remain in the United\n States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for judicial review.\n I do not wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\n DHS then prepared a Final Administrative Removal Order, served\nthe order on Ortiz-Rodriguez, and removed him in January 2018. At the time,\nOrtiz-Rodriguez did not challenge or appeal the expedited removal.\n Following his removal, Ortiz-Rodriguez reentered the United States\ntwice, and he pleaded guilty both times to illegal reentry pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326. For each removal proceeding, DHS reinstated the October 2017\nremoval order and deported him. Then, in May 2023, Border Patrol agents\nfound Ortiz-Rodriguez in Texas, and Ortiz-Rodriguez \u201cfreely and readily\nadmitted\u201d that he was \u201cpresent in the United States without any\nimmigration documents allowing [him] to be in or remain in the United\nStates.\u201d A federal grand jury indicted Ortiz-Rodriguez on one count of\nviolating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), which provides that \u201cany alien who . . . has\nbeen . . . deported, . . . and thereafter . . . enters, attempts to enter, or is at\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 4 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nany time found in, the United States\u201d without permission \u201cshall be fined\nunder Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\u201d 4\n Ortiz-Rodriguez waived his right to a jury and agreed to a stipulated\nbench trial. Ortiz-Rodriguez also moved to dismiss the indictment under 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), which allows for a collateral attack on the validity of a prior\ndeportation order if certain prerequisites are met. 5 Ortiz-Rodriguez attacked\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings, arguing that his evading-arrest\nfelony conviction should no longer qualify as an aggravated felony based on a\n2018 Supreme Court decision and subsequent Fifth Circuit decision that\nresulted in Texas\u2019s evading arrest offense no longer qualifying as a crime of\nviolence that would support removal. 6\n The district court denied Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s motion to dismiss,\nholding that Ortiz-Rodriguez \u201cfailed to show that the [2017 expedited\nremoval] procedure denied him judicial review as required by \u00a7 1326(d).\u201d\nOrtiz-Rodriguez was found guilty and sentenced to fifty-one months of\nimprisonment. Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, but the\ndistrict court granted his motion for an extension of time to file a notice of\nappeal, 7 and Ortiz-Rodriguez appealed within the extended filing window.\n This appeal is consolidated with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s appeal in case No.\n24-50224, in which Ortiz-Rodriguez appealed from the revocation of a three-\nyear term of supervised release imposed as a result of a conviction in a prior\n\u00a7 1326 prosecution.

In United States\nv. Mendoza-Lopez, 18 the Supreme Court explained that where \u201cwaivers of []\nrights to appeal were not considered or intelligent, respondents were\ndeprived of judicial review of their deportation proceeding.\u201d 19 Under our\nprecedents, Ortiz-Rodriguez has the burden of showing that his waiver was\ndeficient: \u201cWhere, as here, the government has produced a written and\nsigned stipulation to removal and waiver of rights, the burden rests with the\ndefendant to show that the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d 20\n Ortiz-Rodriguez broadly argues that his \u201cwaiver was not considered\nand intelligent\u201d because it \u201cfalsely misled\u201d him first by \u201ctelling him that his\nTexas escape conviction was categorized as an aggravated felony\u201d and\nsecond by \u201cnot tell[ing] [him] that he could challenge that determination.\u201d\n The Notice of Intent stated that Ortiz-Rodriguez was deportable\n\u201cbecause [he] ha[d] been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined\nin . . . 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(F),\u201d and the form listed his evading-arrest\nconviction as the qualifying crime.

The government provides no evidence that an\n immigration officer ever met with Valdivia-Flores to explain\n the form or the issues it raised; rather, the government merely\n relies on the sufficiency of the form\u2019s text to communicate\n Valdivia-Flores\u2019s options.\n Under these circumstances, we conclude that Valdivia-\n Flores\u2019s waiver of the right to seek judicial review was not\n considered and intelligent. 35\n But Valdivia-Flores is inconsistent with our precedents, and we\ndecline to follow it; the analysis in Valdivia-Flores is based on an evidentiary\nburden that is reversed in this circuit.

The\nfirst page of the Notice of Intent, located above the checkboxes that\npermitted Ortiz-Rodriguez to admit or contest removability, advised him that\nhe had other options and rights. The page stated he had the right to seek\ncounsel from a \u201clist of available free legal services provided to [him].\u201d It also\nstated he had the right to respond to the charges within thirteen calendar days\nand that his response could \u201crequest, for good cause, an extension of time;\nrebut the charges . . . ; request an opportunity to review the government\u2019s\nevidence; admit deportability; designate the country to which\u201d he would be\nremoved with certain reservations; \u201crequest withholding of removal\u201d under\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or deferral of removal; and request withholding or\ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The page further\nstated he could file a petition for review in a United States Court of Appeals.\n The second page of the Notice was on the back. It contained a\ncertificate of service, where Ortiz-Rodriguez signed an acknowledgment that\nhe received the Notice of Intent. Beneath that certificate of service were the\naforementioned boxes, which permitted an immigrant to check whether\nremoval was contested. Ortiz-Rodriguez was not required to check either\nbox. But he did, and he signed the additional signature line beneath those\nboxes. Just above that signature line, the Notice repeated that he had \u201cthe\nright to remain in the United States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for\njudicial review.\u201d The next two sentences in that same paragraph said, \u201cI do\nnot wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\u201d After reviewing all the\ninformation on the first page, and the information on the second page, Ortiz-\nRodriguez signed on this line.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez had other options; to name one, he could have left\nboth boxes unchecked and filed a written response within thirteen days as the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 15 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nother side of the form expressly told him was an option. The only thing Ortiz-\nRodriguez had to do when served with the Notice was to sign and\nacknowledge receipt\u2014he was not required to contest or admit removability.\n The Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in Charleswell is more helpful to the\nGovernment than to Ortiz-Rodriguez. There, Charleswell launched\ncollateral challenges to both a removal order and a reinstatement order. 45\nThe Third Circuit held that Charleswell was not deprived of an opportunity\nfor judicial review of the removal order despite a \u201csubstantive error of law\u201d\nby the immigration judge (IJ). 46 However, the Third Circuit held that\nCharleswell was \u201cdenied the opportunity of judicial review of the\nreinstatement order\u201d because \u201creasonable persons reading [Charleswell\u2019s\nreinstatement notice] would be led to believe that their only avenue for relief\nif they desire to contest the reinstatement order would be to make . . . [a]\nstatement to the immigration officer.\u201d 47 The Third Circuit cited defects in\nCharleswell\u2019s reinstatement notice that are not present in this case:\n\u201cNowhere on [Charleswell\u2019s reinstatement notice] is there a statement\nalerting the alien that he may seek judicial review, pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(5),\nin the federal courts of appeals.\u201d 48 The Third Circuit even suggested that a\n\u201csensibly easy way to cure this glaring deficiency would be to amend the\nregulations governing the reinstatement process to include, directly on the\nNotice/Intent form, some notice that an alien may seek review of the\nreinstatement determination in the appropriate court of appeals.\u201d 49 The\n _____________________\n Charleswell, 456 F.3d at 349.\n Id. at 353 & n.5 (\u201c[T]he IJ, incredibly, believed that the United States Virgin\nIslands were not a territory of the United States . . . .\u201d).\n Id. at 354-57.\n Id. at 356.\n Id. at 357.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 16 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nNotice of Intent that Ortiz-Rodriguez signed includes exactly that: a\nstatement that he has the right to \u201cfile a petition for review of this order to\nthe appropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n This court\u2019s recent unpublished opinion in United States v.

Douglas, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n All three judges today agree that Ismael Adan Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of fundamental unfairness under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he suffered no prejudice. This alone necessitates\naffirmance. But the majority opinion nevertheless wades into a discussion of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2) and \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process requirement. I disagree with its\nanalysis in this respect and therefore dissent in part.\n I\n As one of three statutorily imposed limitations on collateral attack of\nan underlying removal order, \u00a7 1326(d)(2) requires that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nshow that \u201cthe deportation proceedings at which the order was issued\nimproperly deprived [him] of the opportunity for judicial review.\u201d 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2). The \u201cproceedings\u201d at issue here amounted to an immigration\nagent serving Ortiz-Rodriguez with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order (\u201cNotice of Intent\u201d) and obtaining his\nsignature on that form, thus subjecting Ortiz-Rodriguez to expedited\nremoval. The basis for his expedited removal was a 2017 Texas conviction\nfor evading arrest or detention with a vehicle, Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7 38.04(b)(2)(A), which qualified as an aggravated felony at that time. See 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1228 (permitting expedited removal proceedings for an\nundocumented immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony).\n Although Ortiz-Rodriguez concedes that he could have sought judicial\nreview of his expedited removal, he purportedly waived his right to seek such\nreview. According to Ortiz-Rodriguez, however, such waiver was neither\nconsidered nor intelligent, thereby depriving him of a meaningful\nopportunity for judicial review. See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S.\n828, 840 (1987); see also United States v. Hernandez Velasquez, 120 F.4th\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 30 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n1294, 1297 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[T]he burden rests with the defendant to show\nthat the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d).\n Relevant here, a portion of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s Notice of Intent reads:\n\nAs shown, Ortiz-Rodriguez did not check the first or second checkbox\nindicating that he wished to contest his removal. Nor did he check any of the\nthree checkboxes providing factual bases for contesting his removal: (1) that\nhe is a citizen or national of the United States; (2) that he is a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States; or (3) that he was not convicted of\nthe criminal offense described in the form (i.e., the evading-arrest\nconviction). Also left unchecked was the final box indicating whether he was\nattaching any supporting documentation.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez did, however, check a box on the form that stated: \u201cI\nDo Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding of Removal.\u201d He\nalso checked a box admitting to the allegations and charge listed in the Notice\nof Intent, admitting that he was deportable, and waiving his right to rebut and\ncontest the charges.\n True enough, it seems Ortiz-Rodriguez agreed to waive his right to\ncontest removal. Yet Ortiz-Rodriguez contends that the Notice of Intent\neffectively confined his ability to contest his removability to the three limited\ngrounds provided in the checkboxes, thereby leading him to believe he could\nnot challenge the determination that he had been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony. Those three checkboxes offer only factual grounds for contesting\nremoval, and a legal challenge to the aggravated-felony classification of his\nevading-arrest conviction plainly does not fall within any of the enumerated\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 31 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\noptions. Ortiz-Rodriguez therefore asserts that by presenting a finite set of\nselections, the Notice of Intent delusively suggested that he could only\ncontest his removability on those factual grounds.\n The majority disagrees with Ortiz-Rodriguez for two reasons. See ante\nat 10\u201311. First, the majority highlights that the Notice of Intent elsewhere\nreflected Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s right to petition to the appropriate court of\nappeals. Specifically, it points to a portion of the form informing Ortiz-\nRodriguez of his right to \u201cfile a petition for review of this order to the\nappropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d That portion of the form is not\ninconsistent with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s understanding of the checkboxes: read\ntogether, one could reasonably believe that he has a right to petition for\nreview, but only on the three factual grounds identified by the checkboxes.\nSee United States v. Cortez-Zepeda, No. 24-50418, 2025 WL 1904482, at *5\n(5th Cir. July 10, 2025) (unpublished) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (\u201cLogically,\nthe form\u2019s delineated reasons for filing an appeal should explain how a\ndefendant . . . can pursue the appeal described on the first page of the\nform.\u201d).\n Second, the majority notes that the form did not state that Ortiz-\nRodriguez could only raise factual challenges. But neither did it say that\nOrtiz-Rodriguez could raise legal challenges. And the Notice of Intent\u2019s\nsilence in this respect is hardly determinative of whether Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nwaiver was considered and intelligent. If anything, the form\u2019s lack of clarity\nlends further support to Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument.\n Although omitted from the majority opinion\u2019s reasoning, I wish to\ntouch upon one point raised by the Government during oral argument: that\nthe fourth checkbox indicating the attachment of supporting documentation\nserves as a general \u201ccatch-all\u201d option for contesting removability. Oral Arg.\n18:33\u201319:00. By the Government\u2019s telling, that checkbox offered Ortiz-\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 32 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nRodriguez an exhaustive basis upon which he could contest removal for any\nreason not expressly listed in the three preceding checkboxes, including a\nlegal challenge to the aggravated felony classification. The plain language of\nthat checkbox does not support this interpretation. Although indented in line\nwith the three other checkboxes, the fourth checkbox is substantively\ndistinct. It does not provide an additional reason for contestation; instead, it\nsimply indicates that a contesting party should mark that box in addition to\nany of the three superseding checkboxes when he wishes to attach supporting\ndocumentation.\n By way of example, a party contesting removal based on citizenship\nwould mark the box that reads, \u201cI am a citizen or national of the United\nStates,\u201d and, if they attach documentation like a birth or naturalization\ncertificate supporting that challenge, they may also mark the fourth checkbox\nto indicate as much. This comports with the italicized text preceding the four\ncheckboxes that says, \u201cAttach any supporting documentation.\u201d And\nregardless, it can hardly be said that \u201cattaching documents\u201d logically\nsuggests to a potential petitioner that he may raise a legal challenge. If\nintended to be a true \u201ccatch-all\u201d option as the Government suggests, there\nare a myriad of ways to more clearly provide for such an option (e.g., \u201cOther\u201d\nfollowed by a blank space to write in the basis for the challenge would surely\nbetter achieve this purpose).\n The majority opinion also makes much of the \u201cother options\u201d Ortiz-\nRodriguez had when presented with the Notice of Intent, including that he\ncould have left the waiver box unchecked. Ante at 14\u201315. That he did not do\nso, the majority suggests, somehow validates his waiver. In so doing, the\nmajority opinion glosses over the very core of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument:\nthat the \u201cchoices\u201d the form presented were misleading and, therefore, his\ndecision to check the waiver box was neither considered nor intelligent.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 33 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nAlthough Ortiz-Rodriguez was not \u201cforced to check\u201d the waiver box, that\nalone says nothing about the validity of his waiver.\n Additionally, Ortiz-Rodriguez is not alone in claiming confusion\nstemming from the Notice of Intent\u2019s limited checkboxes. Indeed, this court\ngrappled with the identical issue in a recently decided unpublished decision.\nSee Cortez-Zepeda, 2025 WL 1904482, at *3\u20134; see also id. at *4\u20135 (Dennis,\nJ., dissenting). And as the majority here acknowledges, ante at 11\u201312, the\nNinth Circuit addressed an equally misleading Notice of Intent in United\nStates v. Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2017), overruled on other\ngrounds by Alfred v. Garland, 64 F.4th 1025, 1048 (9th Cir. 2023) (en banc).\nOne question before the Valdivia-Flores court was whether the Notice of\nIntent established that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s waiver of his right to pursue a\njudicial appeal was considered and intelligent. Id. at 1206. The Ninth Circuit\nheld that it did not and, thus, the waiver did not comport with due process.\nSee id. In reaching its conclusion, the court highlighted that the Notice of\nIntent \u201cdid not include an option to contest the classification of the\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and the only check box relevant to the\nconviction itself only allowed Valdivia-Flores to contest that he \u2018was not\nconvicted of the criminal offense described.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1206. Indeed, the Ninth\nCircuit recognized that the Notice of Intent confined Valdivia-Flores to same\nthree fact-based challenges to his removal provided in Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nNotice of Intent. Id. at 1204.\n In distinguishing Valdivia-Flores, the majority opinion places great\nweight on the differing evidentiary approaches among our circuits. Ante at\n12\u201313. But even accounting for these differences, Valdivia-Flores addresses\nthe crux of the issue presented here today: a fundamentally misleading and\ndeficient form. Moreover, Ortiz-Rodriguez, like Valdivia-Flores, was not\nrepresented by legal counsel when he read and signed the Notice of Intent.\nAnd given the expedited nature of his removal proceedings, Ortiz-Rodriguez\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 34 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u201cnever had the benefit of appearing before an immigration judge, who, [ ]\npresume[ably], would have adequately conveyed both his appeal options and\nthe finality associated with waiving appeal.\u201d Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d at\n1206 (citation modified). Thus, against this backdrop, and coupled with the\nform\u2019s misleading language, I would hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s waiver of\nthe right to seek judicial review was not considered and intelligent.\n II\n The majority opinion also concludes that Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\ndemonstrate that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair\nunder \u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he (1) received procedural due process and\n(2) suffered no prejudice. Ante at 17\u201326. I agree with the latter\ndetermination, as Ortiz-Rodriguez cannot show that he would not have been\nsubject to deportation but for the alleged defect in his deportation\nproceedings. United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, 186 F.3d 651, 658\u201359 (5th\nCir. 1999). But I diverge with respect to the conclusion that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nreceived procedural due process.\n As an initial matter, the majority opinion rejects Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nargument that where a prior expedited removal order was premised on a\nconviction that was later found not to be an aggravated felony, the defendant\nhas established both that his due process rights were violated and that he\nsuffered actual prejudice. Ante at 17\u201319. I agree that our court\u2019s precedent\ndictates that removal under these circumstances does not obviate a\ndefendant\u2019s need to prove actual prejudice. See United States v. Ramirez-\nCortinas, 945 F.3d 286, 291\u201393 (5th Cir. 2019). 1 However, I would find that\n\n_____________________\n According to Ortiz-Rodriguez and the majority opinion, see ante at 17\u201318, this\ncourt\u2019s precedent stands in contrast to the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit in United\nStates v. Martinez, 786 F.3d 1227, 1230 (9th Cir. 2015) (\u201cWhere a prior removal order is\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 35 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\na due process violation necessarily occurs when, as here, the defendant was\nremoved via expedited proceedings predicated upon a conviction since\nrecognized not to qualify as an aggravated felony. See United States v.\nAlvarez, 60 F.4th 554, 558 (9th Cir. 2023) (holding that a defendant \u201ccan\nshow that his due process rights were violated by defects in his deportation\nproceeding if he shows that his underlying state conviction was not, in fact,\nan aggravated felony.\u201d).\n With due respect to my colleagues, the cases cited in the majority\nopinion do not support its contrary conclusion. See ante at 18\u201319. In United\nStates v. Parrales-Guzman, 922 F.3d 706 (5th Cir. 2019), we held that\n\u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s bar on collateral attacks attached despite the defendant\u2019s\nremoval order having rested on an unconstitutionally vague statute. Id. at\n707\u201308. Ortiz-Rodriguez does not question that holding. Indeed, Ortiz-\nRodriguez does not argue that he need not satisfy \u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s requirements\ngenerally or \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirements specifically. He merely asserts that\nbecause the Department of Homeland Security classified his evading arrest\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and that conviction was later held not to\nqualify as such, he has sufficiently established both a violation of due process\nand actual prejudice, thereby satisfying \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirement of\nfundamental unfairness. And in Parrales-Guzman, we expressly declined to\nconsider \u00a7 1326(d)(3), holding only that the defendant\u2019s collateral attack\nfailed because he did not exhaust administrative remedies as required by\n _____________________\npremised on the commission of an aggravated felony, a defendant who shows that the crime\nof which he was previously convicted was not, in fact, an aggravated felony, has established\nboth that his due process rights were violated and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d).\nBut more recent decisions from that court seemingly align with our requirement of an\nindependent showing of actual prejudice. See, e.g., United States v. Orozco-Orozco, 94 F.4th\n1118, 1128 (9th Cir. 2024) (holding that a defendant whose removal was based on a\nconviction that did not constitute an aggravated felony had established that the order of\nremoval was defective but \u201cmust [also] show that the defect prejudiced him\u201d).\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 36 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u00a7 1326(d)(1). Id. at 707\u201308, 708 n.1. So, contrary to the majority\u2019s reading\nof that case, we had no occasion to consider the \u201cidentical argument\u201d raised\nby Ortiz-Rodriguez. Ante at 18.\n Our decision in United States v. Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d 286,\nlikewise offers no insight into whether a due process violation has occurred.\nWe held in that case that a defendant whose prior removal was based on a\nconviction no longer deemed an aggravated felony must demonstrate actual\nprejudice under \u00a7 1326(d)(3). Id. at 292\u201393. In other words, \u201c[i]f despite the\nalleged errors, the proceeding could not have yielded a different result,\u201d the\ndefendant\u2019s collateral attack fails for lack of actual prejudice. Id. at 292\n(citation modified). But nothing in Ramirez-Cortinas suggests that the same\nis true for the due process requirement of \u00a7 1326(d)(3); because the\ndefendant failed to show actual prejudice, we did not reach the issue of\nwhether the defendant\u2019s due process rights had been violated.\n The majority opinion\u2019s reliance upon United States v. Palomar-\nSantiago, 593 U.S. 321, 327 (2021), is equally misplaced. There, the Court\nunanimously rejected the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit \u201cthat\ndefendants are excused from proving the first two requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)\nif they were not convicted of an offense that made them removable.\u201d Id. at\n326 (citation modified). The Court reasoned that such a rule allowing an\nundocumented immigrant to circumvent the normal review process when\nthere was a substantive error in the removal order made little sense \u201cif\nfurther administrative review, and then judicial review if necessary, could fix\nthat very error.\u201d Id. at 328. Highlighting the statute\u2019s conjunctive language,\nthe Court held that \u00a7 1326(d) makes clear that its requirements are\n\u201cmandatory,\u201d id. at 326 (quoting Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016));\nthus, the procedural requirements of administrative exhaustion and\ndeprivation of judicial review \u201care not satisfied just because a noncitizen was\nremoved for an offense that did not in fact render him removable,\u201d id. at 327.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 37 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nThe majority opinion extends the Court\u2019s reasoning in Palomar-\nSantiago to \u00a7 1326(d)(3), noting that like \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2), the\nfundamental fairness prong presents \u201c\u2018a question of procedure,\u2019 not\nsubstance.\u201d Ante at 19 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d 225,\n230 (5th Cir. 2002)). Perhaps even more telling is the Court\u2019s unequivocal\nstatement that \u201cdefendants must meet all three\u201d prerequisites of \u00a7 1326(d).\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 326. Again, Ortiz-Rodriguez does not dispute\nthis point. The question he presents is whether he has satisfied those\nmandatory prerequisites for collateral attack of his removal order. The\nPalomar-Santiago Court did not consider that question because \u201cthe narrow\nquestion th[e] Court granted certiorari to decide\u201d asked only whether the\ndefendant was \u201cexcused from\u201d satisfying the first two statutory\nrequirements of \u00a7 1326(d). Id. at 323, 328 n.4.\n What is evident from Palomar-Santiago is that the substantive error of\nwhich Ortiz-Rodriguez complains\u2014that his removal order was premised on\na conviction later found not to be a removable aggravated felony offense\u2014\nneither excuses nor satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2). See id.\nat 327 (\u201cIndeed, the substantive validity of the removal order is quite distinct\nfrom whether the noncitizen exhausted his administrative remedies . . . or\nwas deprived of the opportunity for judicial review . . . .\u201d). The Court\u2019s\nreasoning similarly applies to the actual prejudice requirement of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3): one who is otherwise deportable suffers no prejudice from\nremoval predicated on a conviction that no longer qualifies as an aggravated\nfelony, so that error in felony classification alone does not prove actual\nprejudice. See Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d at 239.\n The same, however, is not true of \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process\nrequirement. When, as here, a defendant\u2019s removal order was premised\nupon a conviction later determined not to be an aggravated felony, that error\nrenders the order defective. See Alvarez, 60 F.4th at 558. Such defects in the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 38 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nunderlying deportation proceeding, in turn, show that defendant\u2019s due\nprocess rights were violated. See id. (holding that due process violations\noccur from defects in underlying deportation proceedings); United States v.\nGuzman, 998 F.3d 562, 566\u201367 (4th Cir. 2021) (same); United States v.\nEstrada, 876 F.3d 885, 887 (6th Cir. 2017) (same). This is so because absent\nthat aggravated felony classification, the defendant would not have been\nsubject to expedited removal proceedings. Instead, the defendant would\nhave had the opportunity to appear before an immigration judge and proffer\ndefenses and, if unsuccessful, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 324. But those processes are unavailable in\nexpedited removal proceedings. Therefore, by subjecting the defendant to\nexpedited removal based upon an error in felony classification, it cannot be\nsaid that \u201cthe administrative deportation procedures . . . afforded [the\ndefendant] the unimpeded opportunity to claim all the procedural due\nprocess to which he was constitutionally entitled.\u201d Benitez-Villafuerte, 186\nF.3d at 657. For these reasons, I would also hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez has\nshown a violation of his due process rights.\n\n38"

Ct. No. 19-CIV-\n CALIFORNIA INSURANCE 06531)\n COMPANY,\n Defendant and\n Appellant.\n\nInsurance Code section 1011 requires a superior court to\nappoint the California Insurance Commissioner (commissioner)\nas the conservator of an insurance company if the insurer,\n\u201cwithout first obtaining the consent in writing of the\ncommissioner, . . . has entered into any transaction the effect of\nwhich is to merge, consolidate, or reinsure substantially its entire\nproperty or business in or with the property or business of any\n\fother person.\u201d (Ins. Code, 1 \u00a7 1011, subd. (c) (section 1011(c)).)\nCalifornia Insurance Company (CIC or CIC I) attempted, without\nthe commissioner\u2019s consent, to merge with a newly-formed New\nMexico corporation, California Insurance Company II, Inc.\n(CIC II), to redomesticate in that state. The trial court therefore\ngranted the commissioner\u2019s application to be appointed as CIC\u2019s\nconservator. Several years later, the trial court approved and\nadopted the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan that specified the\nterms for ending the conservatorship.\n CIC now appeals, arguing the conservatorship was\nunlawfully imposed and should have been vacated. CIC also\ncontends the trial court abused its discretion in approving the\nrehabilitation plan because the plan requires CIC to settle\ncertain litigation against CIC by its policyholders. CIC further\nobjects to a provision in the plan requiring that CIC\u2019s California\npolicies be reinsured and assumed by another company, and, if\nthe reinsurer is affiliated with CIC, that the reinsurer use an\nindependent third-party administrator. We find no merit in\nCIC\u2019s arguments and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n BACKGROUND\n CIC provides worker\u2019s compensation insurance to\nbusinesses. Eighty-five percent of its business is in California.\n Most worker\u2019s compensation insurance consists of\nguaranteed cost policies, under which the policyholder pays the\nsame premium rate regardless of the amount of claims ultimately\n\n1 Undesignated statutory citations are to the Insurance\n\nCode.\n\ffiled under the policy. Another type of policy is a retrospective\nrating plan, under which the premium a policyholder owes is\nadjusted after the end of the policy period, within minimum and\nmaximum levels, based on the amount of losses during the policy\nperiod. (The Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Lara (2022)\n84 Cal.App.5th 1119, 1125.) Because the premium changes based\non the amount of losses, a retrospective rating plan returns some\nrisk to the policyholder. Only large employers can qualify for\nretrospective rating plans because smaller employers are\npresumed to be less sophisticated insurance consumers and less\nable to predict their future losses.\n Retrospective rating plans are issued through an\nendorsement to a guaranteed cost policy. (See The Travelers\nIndemnity Co. v. Lara, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.)\nCalifornia law prohibits an insurer from issuing a worker\u2019s\ncompensation policy or endorsement unless the insurer files a\ncopy of the form or endorsement with a rating organization, the\nWorkers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau, which in turn\npasses it on to the commissioner for approval. (\u00a7 11658,\nsubd. (a).)\n I. EquityComp and Ensuing Litigation\n In 2011, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Steven\nMenzies, together with others, patented a \u201cReinsurance\nParticipation Agreement\u201d (RPA). The RPA was designed to allow\nan insurer to offer a retrospective rating policy to small and\nmedium-sized companies. The RPA would accomplish this by\nhaving an employer take out a guaranteed cost policy, then the\n\finsurer would cede some of the insured risk to a reinsurer, such\nas a captive reinsurer, together with a portion of the premium.\nThe reinsurer would then enter into a side agreement with the\npolicyholder to cede some of that risk back to the policyholder. At\nthe end of the policy period, the reinsurer would refund some of\nthe premiums to the policyholder if the losses were lower than\nexpected or charge the policyholder more if the losses were\nhigher.\n Under a program called EquityComp, CIC followed this\ntemplate and issued guaranteed cost policies that had been\nsubmitted to the rating organization for the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. CIC had its affiliate, Applied Underwriters Captive\nReinsurance Assurance Company (AUCRA), reinsure some of the\nrisk and issue the side agreements to the policyholders, which\nwere not submitted for the commissioner\u2019s approval. An actuary\nemployed by the California Department of Insurance\n(department) opined that CIC\u2019s rates on the standard form policy\nwere on the order of 33 percent higher than the industry average.\n Beginning in 2012, 68 EquityComp policyholders filed\nvarious claims or actions challenging the RPA. In a 2016 ruling\nin one of those challenges, the commissioner found that the RPA\nconstituted a misapplication of CIC\u2019s filed rates in violation of\nsection 11737. (Matter of Shasta Linen Supply, Inc., Insurance\nCommissioner (June 22, 2016) No. AHB-WCA-14-31 (Shasta\nLinen).) The commissioner\u2019s Shasta Linen decision declared that\nCIC\u2019s failure to file and secure approval of the RPA as required\nby section 11658 rendered it void as a matter of law.\n\f CIC petitioned for review of Shasta Linen in Los Angeles\nSuperior Court, and in 2017 the parties settled their dispute.\nThe parties agreed they had a good faith dispute about whether\nthe RPA was void as a matter of law and the remedy authorized\nby the Insurance Code. A recital to the agreement stated that\nthis dispute was \u201cultimately for the courts to decide.\u201d CIC and\nthe department further agreed that the Shasta Linen decision\nwas precedential in administrative proceedings before the\ndepartment, the department had approved an amended RPA with\nadditional disclosures, CIC would not change the amended RPA\nwithout submitting it to the department for review and approval,\nand CIC would dismiss its writ petition. One paragraph of the\nsettlement agreement declared that nothing in it \u201climit[ed] the\npower of the Commissioner to initiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d No employers in California bought any\nEquityComp policies containing the amended RPA after the\nsettlement.\n Litigation on the other RPA claims and actions\npolicyholders had filed against CIC continued in California\ncourts, federal courts, administrative proceedings before the\ncommissioner, and in arbitration. CIC succeeded in defeating\nclass certification motions. (E.g., National Convention Services,\nLLC v. Applied Underwriters Capital Risk Assurance Co.\n(S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2019, No. 15cv7063) 2019 WL 3409882, at *1;\n\fShasta Linen Supply, Inc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (E.D.Cal.\nApr. 17, 2019, Nos. 2:16-cv-158-WBS AC, 2:16-cv-1211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 3244487, at *2.) One federal court granted CIC and its\naffiliates summary judgment on claims that the RPA violated the\nUnfair Competition Law because it was void. (Pet Food Express,\nLtd. v. AUI (E.D.Cal. Sept. 12, 2019, No. 2:16-cv-01211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 4318584, at *2, *4.)\n In other actions, federal district courts ruled that\npolicyholders were liable for premiums due under CIC\u2019s standard\nform guaranteed cost insurance policies even though the RPA\nwas void or regardless of whether it was void. (E.g., Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb. Aug. 2, 2018,\nNo. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4 [granting summary\njudgment on premiums due under guaranteed cost policy without\ndeciding whether RPA was void].) Ten administrative decisions\nby the commissioner likewise declared the RPA to be void and\nunlawful but affirmed the legality of CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npolicies. In California courts, this court and two other appellate\ncourts held that CIC\u2019s failure to file the RPA or related\nagreement with the commissioner rendered the arbitration\nagreement contained within the RPA or related agreement void\nas a matter of law. (Jackpot Harvesting, Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 719, 738; Luxor Cabs,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (2018)\n30 Cal.App.5th 970, 976\u2013977 (Luxor Cabs); Nielsen Contracting,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1096,\n1113\u20131114 (Nielsen Contracting).) Many trial courts before and\n\fafter these decisions likewise held that the RPA\u2019s arbitration\nprovision or the RPA in its entirety was void or invalid. Two\narbitrators found the RPA to be valid, one made no ruling on its\nlegality, one did not rule on its legality under section 11658 but\nfound it contained misrepresentations and was unconscionable,\none found the RPA should have been filed but that the\npolicyholder did not have a private right of action to enforce that\nrequirement, and seven found the RPA to be invalid in whole or\nin part. Some of those arbitrators awarded damages to the\npolicyholder. One of those seven, like the federal decisions,\nissued an award requiring the policyholder to pay premiums due\nto CIC under the guaranteed cost policy. Many cases have yet to\nbe fully resolved because of a stay in connection with the\ninitiation of the conservatorship at issue here.\n II. Menzies Acquisition and Attempted Merger\n As of January 2019, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire\nHathaway) indirectly owned 81 percent of CIC and its affiliates.\nBerkshire Hathaway agreed that month to sell its shares to\nMenzies, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, who already\nowned 11.5 percent of the company. The agreement allowed\nBerkshire Hathaway to retain a $50 million breakup fee if the\ntransaction did not close by September 30, 2019.\n As required by section 1215.2, subdivision (a), in April 2019\nMenzies submitted an application to the department for approval\nof the transaction. The application informed the commissioner of\nthe breakup fee and transaction deadline. The commissioner had\n60 days to act on the application. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d).) After the\n\fcommissioner found Menzies\u2019 first two applications insufficient\nand Menzies withdrew them, Menzies submitted a third\napplication on September 7, 2019.\n On September 13, 2019, the department sent CIC various\nfollow-up questions, including a question about CIC\u2019s total\nliability in pending litigation. CIC responded that it was\ndefending 50 cases and its total liability was $50 million. CIC at\nthe time had $1.1 billion in assets, $615 million in capital and\nsurplus, and $240 million on deposit with the department. On\nSeptember 19 and 24, 2019, the department asked follow-up\nquestions on other matters, to which CIC promptly responded.\nOn September 27, 2019, the department informed CIC that it\ncould neither approve nor disapprove CIC\u2019s application by\nSeptember 30 because it had numerous remaining questions\nabout the pending litigation\u2019s financial impact on CIC.\n Berkshire Hathaway required CIC to pay $10 million for an\nextension of the transaction deadline until October 10, 2019.\nMenzies then proposed and the New Mexico Office of the\nSuperintendent of Insurance agreed to hold an expedited\napproval process to re-domesticate CIC in New Mexico by\nmerging CIC into a newly formed New Mexico corporation, CIC\nII. On October 9, 2019, a department attorney participated in a\nconfidential meeting of New Mexico, Texas, and California\ninsurance regulators. Later the same day, the New Mexico\nsuperintendent of insurance held a hearing on CIC\u2019s merger\napplication. Department representatives monitored the hearing\nby phone. A New Mexico official testified that after the meeting\n\fearlier that day, she was aware of objections from other\nregulators. The New Mexico superintendent approved the\nmerger, conditioned on the stock transactions between Menzies\nand Berkshire Hathaway closing by October 10, 2019, and CIC II\nimmediately afterwards filing articles of merger with the New\nMexico Secretary of State. The New Mexico order required CIC\nII to assume liability for all of CIC\u2019s issued policies and maintain\nits $240 million deposit with the department.\n In a press release after the hearing, the New Mexico Office\nof the Superintendent of Insurance announced that during the\npre-meeting call the department had failed to articulate any basis\nfor denying the proposed merger under New Mexico law and had\nsaid that the proposed merger presented no risks to California\npolicyholders. However, the department representatives said\nafterwards that they had never made the latter statement. The\npress release also said that no one in attendance at the hearing\noffered any objection to the merger. The department\nrepresentatives later said they did not register an objection\nduring the hearing because the issue in the hearing was whether\nto approve a transaction under New Mexico law, which was an\nissue for the New Mexico regulator.\n Later on the day of the hearing, Berkshire Hathaway\nnotified the department that, based on the lack of objections at\nthe hearing, it intended to close the sale to Menzies on October\n10, 2019. On the same day, the department notified CIC that if\nthe merger was completed without the commissioner\u2019s approval,\nCIC would be in violation of California law. Post-merger, CIC\n\fwould cease to exist, and CIC II, as an unlicensed insurer, would\nbe precluded from transacting the business of insurance in\nCalifornia until it became admitted. 2 The department did not\nrespond to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s letter, and its transaction with\nMenzies closed.\n CIC II satisfied the New Mexico superintendent\u2019s\nconditions for approval, so the merger of CIC with CIC II would\nbe completed by filing a certificate of merger with the California\nSecretary of State. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) On October\n22, 2019, the department asked CIC by telephone not to file the\ncertificate of merger with the California Secretary of State so\nthat the parties could meet and resolve their issues. CIC agreed,\nbut the parties never met.\n III. Conservatorship\n On November 4, 2019, without notice to CIC, the\ncommissioner filed an ex parte application to be appointed\nconservator of CIC. The application relied on section 1011(c),\nwhich requires a court to appoint the commissioner as\nconservator of an insurance company if the commissioner shows\nthe company has, without the commissioner\u2019s consent,\ntransferred or attempted to transfer substantially its entire\n\n2 A company is \u201cadmitted\u201d to transact a class of insurance\n\nby obtaining a certificate of authority from the commissioner.\n(\u00a7 700, subd. (a).) Before issuing a certificate of authority, the\ncommissioner must consider the applicant\u2019s qualifications with\nrespect to, among other things, capital and surplus, financial\nstability, and reinsurance, as well as the \u201ccompetency, character,\nand integrity of management\u201d and the \u201cfairness and honesty of\nmethods of doing business.\u201d (\u00a7 717.)\n\fbusiness or entered into a transaction to merge. The\ncommissioner alleged CIC violated this provision by attempting\nto merge with CIC II without the commissioner\u2019s approval under\nsection 1215.2, subdivision (a). The commissioner further alleged\nthat providing notice of the application to CIC would have been\nprejudicial because CIC could have completed the merger by\nfiling the certificate of merger. The trial court issued the\nrequested order the same day.\n In January 2020, CIC moved to vacate the conservatorship\norder, arguing, among other things, that the conservatorship was\nunnecessary because CIC consented to an injunction against the\nmerger pending the commissioner\u2019s approval. In August 2020,\nthe trial court denied CIC\u2019s motion. CIC challenged the order by\nfiling a petition for writ of mandate in this court in October 2020,\nbut this court summarily denied CIC\u2019s petition. (Cal. Ins. Co. v.\nSuperior Court (Nov. 25, 2020, A161049).) CIC II and an affiliate\nof CIC filed federal actions seeking to vacate the conservatorship\nand enjoin it. (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n530 F.Supp.3d 914; California Ins. Co. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n547 F.Supp.3d 908.) The district courts dismissed both suits, and\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara (9th Cir. 2022) 37 F.4th 579, 600.)\n IV. Rehabilitation Plan\n In October 2020, the commissioner filed an application for\napproval of a rehabilitation plan, which would end the\nconservatorship. Two aspects of the plan are relevant here.\n\f Section 2.2 of the plan would require CIC and AUCRA to\nenter into an \u201cAssumption Reinsurance and Administration\nAgreement\u201d to allow an insurer admitted in California to reinsure\nand assume all of CIC\u2019s California policies and liabilities to\npolicyholders. Under this provision of the plan, the commissioner\nwould solicit bids and select the reinsurer. If the commissioner\nwere to select an affiliate of CIC as the reinsurer, that reinsurer\nwould have to hire an independent third-party administrator for\nclaims administration. Upon the effective date of the assumption\nand reinsurance agreement, the commissioner as CIC\u2019s\nconservator would effectuate the merger of CIC into CIC II,\nthereby redomesticating CIC in New Mexico, and cancel CIC\u2019s\ncertificate of authority to transact business in California.\n Section 2.6 concerns the pending litigation against CIC.\nSection 2.6 incorporated by reference schedule 2.6, which sets out\nthree options under which CIC and AUCRA would offer to settle\nthe litigation against them. Option 1 would allow policyholders\nto renounce the RPA and obtain restitution of any amounts they\npaid CIC over the cost of the guaranteed cost policy premiums.\nOption 2 would allow policyholders to renounce the RPA and\nobtain restitution of any amounts they paid over the cost of a\nstandard, approved retrospective rating plan at the time of the\npolicy\u2019s inception. And option 3 would allow policyholders to\nratify the RPA and accept liability under it. CIC\u2019s liability to any\nclaimant who did not accept one of the settlement options would\npass to the reinsurer under the reinsurance and assumption\n\fagreement, and the conservator would set aside a reserve amount\nto cover those claims.\n CIC opposed the settlement provision in section 2.6 of the\nplan. It did not object to the reinsurance and assumption\nprovision in section 2.2, so long as its affiliate Continental\nIndemnity Company (Continental) had the right to match any\nother company\u2019s offer for CIC\u2019s California policies and the\ncommissioner dropped the requirement that an affiliate reinsurer\nuse an independent third-party administrator for claims\nhandling.\n The trial court approved the plan in April 2024. CIC\nappealed and also filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging\nthe approval of the plan. This court summarily denied the\npetition in a one-paragraph order, noting that CIC had failed to\ndemonstrate that its remedy on appeal was inadequate. (Cal.\nIns. Co. v. Superior Court (June 20, 2024, A170573).)\n DISCUSSION\n I. Appealability\n An order approving a rehabilitation plan for an insurer\nunder a conservatorship is appealable under section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Quackenbush\nv. Mission Ins. Co. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 458, 461, fn. 1, citing\nCode Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(1) & Carpenter v. Pacific Mut.\nLife Ins. Co. (1937) 10 Cal.2d 307, 322\u2013323 (Carpenter).)\n The commissioner disputes this and urges us to treat the\nappeal as a writ proceeding. He asserts that a conservatorship\nproceeding under Insurance Code section 1011 is a special\n\fproceeding to which section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure\ndoes not apply. He points out that section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) is contained in Part 2 of that code and that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court \u201clong ago held that Part 2 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure extends generally only to civil \u2018actions,\u2019 and not\nto \u2018special proceedings.\u2019 \u201d (Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.\nTex-Cal Land Management, Inc. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707.) That\nremark, however, concerned the applicability of the appellate\nstay provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 916 et seq. (Tex-\nCal, at pp. 706\u2013707.) In the same case, the California Supreme\nCourt also observed that \u201c[i]t has long been established that the\nstatutory right of appeal of final judgments and orders extends\neven to \u2018special proceedings [including] those intended to be\nsummary in nature\u2019 unless the Legislature has expressly\nprohibited an appeal in the particular case.\u201d (Id. at p. 705.)\nConsistent with this statement is Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at\npages 322\u2013323, which entertained an appeal from an order\napproving a rehabilitation plan and held that the appeal\nencompassed all preliminary orders that preceded it.\n The commissioner fears that aggrieved parties in\nconservation proceedings will assert a right to immediate appeal\nfrom different types of rulings, including procedural orders and\nevidentiary findings, which will create confusion and delay. We\ndo not hold that any conservation-related order is appealable,\nmerely that the rehabilitation plan order that will resolve the\n\fconservation is appealable. 3 The commissioner also suggests that\nthe approval of the rehabilitation plan does not determine all of\nCIC\u2019s rights, since the commissioner will still periodically require\njudicial orders relating to implementation of the plan. But\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 323, noted that a proceeding\nfor a conservatorship of an insurer lasts \u201cuntil the proposed plan\nis ultimately passed upon.\u201d In addition, a final judgment is a\ndetermination that \u201c \u2018 \u201cterminates the litigation between the\nparties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done\nbut to enforce by execution what has been determined.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 288, 304.) The\norder approving the rehabilitation plan fits this description, since\nthe only thing remaining after that order is the execution of the\nplan, at the end of which CIC will merge with CIC II and cease to\nexist as an independent entity. We therefore agree with CIC that\nthe order approving the rehabilitation plan is appealable, and we\n\n3 In particular, interim orders involving the conservator\u2019s\n\nmanagement of the conserved insurer would likely not be\nappealable. For example, in this case CIC moved to modify the\nconservatorship order and to vacate the conservatorship. CIC\nnoted in its petition for writ of mandate challenging those orders\nthat they were not appealable. Similarly, an order allowing\ndiscovery, like the one the trial court entered here, or an order\napproving the commissioner\u2019s fixing of expenses of\nconservatorship, to be paid out of the assets of the conserved\ninsurer (\u00a7 1035, subd. (a)), would likely not be appealable under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(1). Any\nchallenge to such orders would have to be pursued by writ\npetition or in an appeal from the order approving the\nrehabilitation plan or otherwise ending the conservatorship.\n\fdecline the commissioner\u2019s invitation to treat the appeal as a writ\nproceeding.\n II. Standard of Review\n The commissioner placed CIC in conservatorship and\nproposed the rehabilitation plan pursuant to authority under\nsection 1011(c). \u201cThe statutory authority he exercises in that\neffort is an aspect of the police power of the state. It is\nsubstantial in its scope, but not boundless. Its basic parameters\nwere described by our Supreme Court over [85] years ago in\nCarpenter v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, 10 Cal.2d at page\n329: \u2018The only restriction on the exercise of this power is that the\nstate\u2019s action shall be reasonably related to the public interest\nand shall not be arbitrary or improperly discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d\n(Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th\n393, 398.) As the parties here both recognize, this has been held\nto require a trial court to review a commissioner\u2019s action \u201cunder\nthe abuse of discretion standard [citation]: was the action\narbitrary, i.e., unsupported by a rational basis, or is it contrary to\nspecific statute, a breach of the fiduciary duty of the conservator\nas trustee, or improperly discriminatory?\u201d (In re Executive Life\nIns. Co. (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 344, 358.) On appeal, \u201c[w]e also\ntest the action of the trial court by the abuse of discretion\nstandard. [Citation.] In this connection we employ the\nequivalent of the substantial evidence test by accepting the trial\ncourt\u2019s resolution of credibility and conflicting substantial\nevidence, and its choice of possible reasonable inferences.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\f III. Analysis\n CIC challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of the\nconservatorship in the first place, its refusal to vacate it, and its\napproval of the rehabilitation plan that would now end it. We\nconsider each argument in turn.\n A. Imposition of the conservatorship\n CIC contends the conservatorship was unlawfully imposed\nbecause there have never been any concerns about CIC\u2019s solvency\nor financial condition. 4 CIC\u2019s argument rests on the interplay of\nsection 1011, which authorizes conservatorships of insurers, and\nsections 1215.2, 1215.10, 1215.12, and 1215.16, which concern\nacquisitions or mergers of insurers. While CIC\u2019s argument is not\ncomplicated, to follow it one must first understand the operation\nof the relevant statutes.\n Section 1011 states that the \u201csuperior court of the county in\nwhich the principal office of a person [purporting to do insurance\nbusiness] is located, upon the filing by the commissioner of the\nverified application showing any of the conditions in this\nsubdivision exist, . . . shall issue its order vesting title to all of the\nassets of that person, wheresoever situated, in the commissioner\nor his or her successor in office, in his or her official capacity, and\n\n4 The commissioner argues in a footnote that CIC cannot\n\nargue that a conservation based on an unapproved attempt to\nmerge also requires the threat of insolvency because CIC did not\nraise that issue below. We need not respond to arguments raised\nonly in a footnote. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)\n43 Cal.App.5th 404, 419 [\u201cAn appellant cannot bury a substantive\nlegal argument in a footnote and hope to avoid waiver of that\nargument.\u201d].)\n\fdirect the commissioner . . . to conduct, as conservator, the\nbusiness of the person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011; see \u00a7 1010 [conservatorship\nstatutes apply to, among others, all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state\u201d].) The list of circumstances\nsupporting a conservatorship includes \u201c[t]hat the person, without\nfirst obtaining the consent in writing of the commissioner, has\ntransferred, or attempted to transfer, substantially its entire\nproperty or business or, without consent, has entered into any\ntransaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate, or\nreinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with\nthe property or business of any other person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011(c).) It also\nincludes the circumstance \u201c[t]hat the person is found, after an\nexamination, to be in a condition that makes its further\ntransaction of business hazardous to its policyholders, or\ncreditors, or to the public.\u201d (Id., subd. (d).) The Legislature\nenacted section 1011 in 1935, and the wording of these triggering\nconditions for a conservatorship remains substantively\nunchanged since then. (Stats. 1935, ch. 145, \u00a7 1011, p. 540.)\n In 1969, the Legislature added article 4.7 to division 1, part\n2, chapter 2 of the Insurance Code and titled it the \u201cInsurance\nHolding Company System Regulatory Act.\u201d (Stats. 1969,\nch. 1275, \u00a7 1, pp. 2487\u20132488.) As relevant here, section 1215.2,\nsubdivision (a) states, \u201cA person shall not make a tender offer for,\nor a request or invitation for tenders of, or enter into an\nagreement to exchange securities for or acquire in the open\nmarket, any voting security, or any security convertible into a\nvoting security, of a domestic insurer or of any other person\n\fcontrolling a domestic insurer, if the other person is not\nsubstantially engaged either directly or through its affiliates in\nany businesses other than that of insurance, if, as a result of the\nconsummation thereof, the person would, directly or indirectly,\nacquire control of the insurer, and a person shall not enter into\nan agreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer, unless, at the time copies of the offer, purchase,\nrequest, or invitation are first published, sent, or given to\nsecurity holders or the agreement or transaction is entered into,\nas the case may be, the person has filed with the commissioner,\nand has sent to the insurer, a statement containing\u201d certain\ninformation. The required disclosures include the backgrounds\nand identities of everyone on whose behalf the transaction is to\nbe effected; the source of the funds to be used; and any plans or\nproposals to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or merge it.\n(\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (a)(1)\u2013(5).)\n Section 1215.2, subdivision (d) states, \u201cThe purchases,\nexchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control referred to in\nsubdivision (a) may not be made until the commissioner approves\nthe purchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of\ncontrol. The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the\ntransaction on or before the latter of 60 days after the statement\nrequired by subdivision (a) has been filed with the commissioner\nor, if a hearing is held pursuant to subdivision (f), 30 days after\nthe close of the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f).\u201d The\nstatute then lists reasons why the commissioner may disapprove\nthe transaction. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d)(1)\u2013(5).)\n\f Section 1215.10, subdivision (a) allows the commissioner to\napply for an injunction when it appears to the commissioner that\nan insurer \u201chas committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nthe Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act. Section\n1215.12 states in full, \u201cWhenever it appears to the commissioner\nthat any person has committed a violation of this article which so\nimpairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to\nthreaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business\nby it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or\nthe public, then the commissioner may proceed as provided in\nArticle 14 (commencing with Section 1010) of Chapter 1 of this\npart to take possession of the property of the domestic insurer\nand to conduct the business thereof.\u201d Finally, section 1215.16\nstates in full, \u201cAll laws and parts of laws of this state inconsistent\nwith this article are hereby superseded with respect to matters\ncovered by this article.\u201d\n CIC\u2019s argument based on these statutes takes two forms,\neach of them straightforward. CIC first argues narrowly that the\ncommissioner\u2019s conservatorship application alleged violations of\nsection 1215.2 to justify the conservatorship, so the\ncommissioner\u2019s failure to identify any financial impairment\nmeans his application did not satisfy section 1215.12\u2019s\nrequirements for a conservatorship. This is incorrect. The first\nsentence of the commissioner\u2019s application states that the\napplication rests on section 1011. The application later alleges\nrepeatedly that Menzies\u2019 attempt to merge CIC with CIC II\njustified a conservatorship under section 1011. The\n\fcommissioner unambiguously relied on his authority under\nsection 1011, not section 1215.12. The application does further\nallege that the attempted merger without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval also violated section 1215.2. But these further\nallegations do not undermine or disclaim the reliance on section\n1011, so the commissioner\u2019s application properly relied on his\nauthority under that statute.\n CIC also argues more broadly that the Legislature limited\nthe reach of section 1011(c) \u2014 which CIC terms a historic,\ngeneral statutory provision \u2014 when it enacted what CIC calls the\nspecific, remedial structure for unauthorized mergers in article\n4.7. CIC contends that by specifying in section 1215.12 that the\ncommissioner can impose a conservatorship under section 1011\nand related statutes for an unauthorized merger that \u201cso impairs\nthe financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten\ninsolvency or make the further transaction of business by it\nhazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the\npublic\u201d and enacting section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision, the\nLegislature repealed the broader authorization of\nconservatorships in section 1011(c) for any unauthorized merger.\nAccording to CIC, if an authorized merger does not so impair the\nfinancial condition of an insurer that it threatens insolvency or\nmakes the operation of the insurer hazardous, then the\ncommissioner may not impose a conservatorship and may only\npursue injunctive relief.\n We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended section\n1215.16 to expressly repeal section 1011(c), as CIC contends.\n\fMost obviously, section 1011 remains in effect; the bill that\nenacted sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 did not repeal section\n1011(c). Section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision is not to the\ncontrary. Section 1215.12 invokes the conservatorship\nproceedings under section 1010 and following sections, so the\nLegislature intended those statutes to remain in effect. It would\nbe strange for the Legislature to allow section 1011(c) to remain\nin force, authorizing a conservatorship whenever an insurer\nattempts to merge its business without permission, while\nobliquely limiting it through sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 to\nauthorize a conservatorship only when a merger creates a risk of\nfinancial impairment. It would be particularly strange to do so\nwhile leaving section 1011, subdivision (d) in effect, which\nauthorizes a conservatorship whenever an insurer is found to be\nin a hazardous condition. A far more natural method of\nachieving the purpose that CIC ascribes to the Legislature would\nhave been to add the requirement of financial impairment to\nsection 1011(c), but the Legislature did not do this.\n Although CIC protests that section 1215.16 makes this a\nquestion of express repeal, in actuality CIC\u2019s argument is one of\nimplied repeal. \u201cRepeals by implication are disfavored.\u201d (Lopez\nv. Sony Electronics, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 627, 637.)\n\u201c \u2018Notwithstanding the \u201cpresumption against repeals by\nimplication,\u201d repeal may be found where (1) \u201cthe two acts are so\ninconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation,\u201d\nor (2) \u201cthe later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent\nto supersede the earlier\u201d provision.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because \u201cthe\n\fdoctrine of implied repeal provides that the most recently enacted\nstatute expresses the will of the Legislature\u201d [citation],\napplication of the doctrine is appropriate in those limited\nsituations where it is necessary to effectuate the intent of\ndrafters of the newly enacted statute. \u201c \u2018In order for the second\nlaw to repeal or supersede the first, the former must constitute a\nrevision of the entire subject, so that the court may say that it\nwas intended to be a substitute for the first.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Wishnev v. The\nNorthwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. (2019) 8 Cal.5th 199, 211.)\n As the commissioner points out, section 1215.12 is easy to\nharmonize with section 1011(c). The conservatorship statutes,\nincluding section 1011, apply to all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1010.) Section 1011(c)\nallows for a conservatorship of an insurer based on an attempted\nmerger without requiring a showing of insolvency or financial\nhazard.\n Section 1215.12, meanwhile, applies to a broader group\nthan just insurers, but allows for conservatorships in narrower\ncircumstances. Section 1215.12 allows the commissioner to place\nan insurer in a conservatorship when it appears to the\ncommissioner that \u201cany person\u201d has violated section 1215.2 or\nother statutes in a way that impairs the financial condition of an\ninsurer that threatens insolvency or makes the insurer\u2019s further\noperation hazardous. Section 1215.2, subdivision (a), among\nother things, prohibits a \u201cperson\u201d from making a tender offer or\nrequesting or inviting tenders for securities of an insurer or a\n\u201cperson\u201d controlling an insurer, or from \u201center[ing] into an\n\fagreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer\u201d unless, when the offer, request, or agreement is\nmade, the required information has been filed with the\ncommissioner. Section 1215.2 further provides that such\n\u201cpurchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control\u201d\nmay not be made without the commissioner\u2019s approval. (Id.,\nsubd. (d).) \u201cPerson\u201d is defined for both of these sections to include\nany individual or other entity. (\u00a7 1215, subd. (m).) Because\nsection 1215.12 applies to non-insurers and prohibits anyone\nfrom even offering to buy an insurer without satisfying the\nstatutory requirements, it makes sense that the Legislature\nwould limit conservatorships based on violations of such\nrequirements to those that threaten the solvency or safe\noperation of the insurer.\n The Legislature\u2019s limitation of the scope of the remedy for\nits new requirements applicable to non-insurers does not mean\nthat it also intended to limit the scope of the existing remedy\napplicable only to insurers. When an insurer violates section\n1215.2 by agreeing to merge, as CIC did, it triggers the provision\nin section 1011(c), even if that agreement did not also trigger\nsection 1215.12 because it did not threaten the insurer\u2019s solvency\nor make its continued operation hazardous. Because sections\n1215.2 and 1215.12 are not incompatible with section 1011(c),\nevince no intent to supersede section 1011(c), and did not revise\nthe entire subject of conservatorships of insurers, but rather\nadded a more limited conservatorship remedy for a broader set of\n\factors, we hold that section 1215.2 and 1215.12 did not expressly\nor impliedly repeal section 1011(c).\n CIC contends that the commissioner has only ever invoked\nsection 1011(c) for insurers in financial distress and cites various\ncases describing section 1011 conservatorships as the state\nequivalent of bankruptcy law for insurers. (E.g., State of\nCalifornia v. Altus Finance (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1295 [\u00a7 1011\n\u201cis part of . . . article 14,\u201d which \u201crelate[s] to the Commissioner\u2019s\ntreatment of insolvent insurers\u201d and is the \u201cequivalent of federal\nbankruptcy laws\u201d]; Financial Indemnity Co. v. Superior Court of\nLos Angeles (1955) 45 Cal.2d 395, 402 [\u201cThe primary purpose for\nthe drastic remedy [of conservatorship] . . . is to prevent\ndissipation of the assets of the company after the commissioner\nhas determined that a hazardous condition exists.\u201d].)\n We agree that this case appears to be the first decision\ndealing with a conservatorship involving an insurer not in\nfinancial distress. However, the absence of a precedent directly\non point demonstrates only that before CIC, solvent insurers\nwere careful to obtain the necessary approval before placing their\nbusiness at risk of conservatorship. While the conservatorship\nsystem does replace the bankruptcy system for insurers, who are\nexcluded from federal bankruptcy, that does not mean that only\nbankrupt or insolvent insurers can be placed under\nconservatorship. As our Supreme Court explained long ago in\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 329, \u201cIt is no longer open to\nquestion that the business of insurance is affected with a public\ninterest\u201d because \u201c[i]nsurance is a public asset, a basis of credit,\n\fand a vital factor in business activity.\u201d Carpenter involved an\ninsolvent insurer, but given the role insurance plays in the\neconomy and society, the public\u2019s interest in insurers and the\ninsurance industry extends beyond insolvency to ensuring that\ninsurers follow statutes and regulations enacted to protect\npolicyholders and the public.\n The plain language of section 1011(c) permits a\nconservatorship based on an attempted unauthorized merger\neven when the insurer involved is solvent, and it is not absurd for\nthe Legislature to intend to prohibit insurers from merging\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s consent, regardless of solvency\nquestions. We therefore follow the statute\u2019s plain language.\n(People v. Velador (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 687, 693 [if statutory\nlanguage is clear, courts must follow its plain meaning unless it\nwould result in absurd consequences that the Legislature did not\nintend].)\n B. Maintenance of the conservatorship\n CIC argues that even if the commissioner properly placed\nCIC under conservatorship based only on the attempted merger,\nthe commissioner and the trial court abused their discretion by\nnot vacating the conservatorship on CIC\u2019s motion when CIC\nagreed to an injunction prohibiting it from completing the\nmerger. CIC contends its offer to stipulate to an injunction made\nthe conservatorship unnecessary. It further contends the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to vacate the injunction failed to account for\nvarious facts, including that the merger was only necessary to\nsatisfy the Berkshire Hathaway deadline after the commissioner\n\frefused to approve or disapprove Menzies\u2019 application to acquire\nCIC due to concerns about the RPA litigation. CIC also asserts\nthat the department appeared at the New Mexico merger hearing\nand did not object, CIC complied when the commissioner asked it\nnot to file the certificate with the Secretary of State to complete\nthe merger in California, the commissioner failed to raise any\nconcerns about the RPA litigation during its consideration of\nMenzies\u2019 application to acquire CIC until days before the\nBerkshire Hathaway deadline, and CIC\u2019s assets and capital were\nmore than sufficient to address the maximum exposure from the\nRPA litigation.\n We reject CIC\u2019s argument for the same reasons that the\nNinth Circuit rejected the similar argument that the\nconservatorship proceeding was brought in bad faith. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th 579.) As the Ninth\nCircuit explained, \u201cthe conservatorship action was brought for a\nlegitimate reason \u2014 indeed, [CIC\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019] own factual\nallegations make out a violation of \u00a7 1215.2(d) sufficient to\ntrigger a conservatorship under \u00a7 1011(c). The allegations make\nclear that [CIC and its affiliates] neither sought nor received\napproval from the [department] for the proposed purchase of the\ncontrolling interest in CIC I and the concomitant CIC I / CIC II\nmerger, as required by California Insurance Code \u00a7 1215.2(d),\nand that the merger was an obvious attempt to avoid the\nCalifornia insurance regulatory regime.\u201d (Id. at p. 597.) Given\nthat CIC created the RPA with the express intent of bypassing\nstate insurance regulations limiting the marketing of\n\fretrospective rating policies, the commissioner determined that\nthe RPA was unlawful and void, and that CIC attempted to\nmerge with an out-of-state entity a matter of days after the\ncommissioner raised concerns about CIC\u2019s litigation of suits\nbased on the void RPA, the commissioner could reasonably\ndetermine that it was necessary to place CIC under\nconservatorship to prevent CIC from pursuing any further\nschemes to dodge or stymie the commissioner\u2019s oversight, despite\nthe offer to stipulate to an injunction.\n The various facts that CIC cites, even if true, are beside the\npoint. Fundamentally, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, Menzies\n\u201cmade a $50 million bet with Berkshire Hathaway . . . that he\ncould complete the purchase of Berkshire [Hathaway]\u2019s\ncontrolling interest in CIC I by September 30, 2019.\u201d (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 584.) The\ndeadline was not of the commissioner\u2019s making. Menzies lost the\nbet when the commissioner failed to approve the transaction by\nthe deadline Berkshire Hathaway set. The answer, then, was for\nMenzies to pay his loss by forfeiting the breakup fee (ibid.), not\nfor Menzies and CIC to try to seek to complete the transaction\nanyway by hurriedly redomesticating CIC within less than two\nweeks by merging with a newly created out-of-state entity\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s approval. Given CIC\u2019s demonstrated\nwillingness to flout the law for its own financial gain, the trial\ncourt and by extension the commissioner did not abuse their\ndiscretion by concluding that a conservatorship was necessary to\n\fensure CIC\u2019s compliance with the law, rather than acceding to\nCIC\u2019s preferred course of a stipulated injunction.\n This case is comparable in this regard to Caminetti v.\nGuaranty Union Life Ins. Co. (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 330. The\ncommissioner there placed an insurer in conservatorship because\nthe insurer\u2019s management was paying itself excessive salaries\nthat placed the insurer in a hazardous condition. (Id. at pp. 332\u2013\n335.) The insurer later argued that the trial court should have\nterminated the conservatorship because the insurer removed the\ngrounds for the conservatorship by voluntarily reducing the\nmanagement\u2019s salaries. (Id. at pp. 335\u2013336.) The Court of\nAppeal noted that the same management remained in control\nand found that the trial court or commissioner would only be\nwarranted in returning the company back to the management\u2019s\ncontrol if there was evidence that their state of mind had\nchanged. (Id. at p. 336.) The Court of Appeal deferred to the\ntrial court\u2019s conclusion, after taking evidence, that the\nmanagement \u201cshould not again be permitted to control the\ndestinies of the policyholders.\u201d (Ibid.) So, too, here, the court and\nthe commissioner would only have been obligated to terminate\nthe conservatorship if there were evidence that CIC\u2019s\nmanagement had changed its state of mind. We defer to the trial\ncourt\u2019s view that the stipulation to an injunction was insufficient,\ngiven the other evidence of CIC\u2019s intentionally evasive behavior.\n C. Rehabilitation plan to end the conservatorship\n CIC\u2019s remaining arguments challenge the terms of the\ncommissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan pursuant to which CIC can\n\fexit conservatorship, complete its merger with CIC II, and\nredomesticate in New Mexico.\n A conservatorship under section 1011 \u201ccontemplates, not\nthe liquidation of the company involved, but a conservation of the\nassets and business of the company over the period of stress by\nthe commissioner who thereafter yields the control and direction\nto the regular officers of the company.\u201d (Caminetti v. Superior\nCourt (1941) 16 Cal.2d 838, 843.) Section 1012 sets out the terms\nfor ending a conservatorship under section 1011. It states that\nwith one exception not relevant here, a conservatorship order\n\u201cshall continue in force and effect until, on the application either\nof the commissioner or of [the insurer under conservatorship], it\nshall, after a full hearing, appear to the court that the ground for\nthe order directing the commissioner to take title and possession\ndoes not exist or has been removed and that the person can\nproperly resume title and possession of its property and the\nconduct of its business.\u201d (\u00a7 1012.) \u201cIn order to effect\nrehabilitation, the Commissioner may enter into a court-\napproved rehabilitation agreement.\u201d (State of California v. Altus\nFinance, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1295; accord, \u00a7 1043 [\u201cthe\ncommissioner, as conservator or as liquidator, may, subject to the\napproval of said court, . . . mutualize or reinsure the business of\nsuch person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements\u201d]; Carpenter,\nsupra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 323 [\u201cwhen the commissioner files a\npetition to be appointed conservator and asks authority to work\nout a rehabilitation plan,\u201d the proceeding lasts \u201cuntil the\nproposed plan is ultimately passed upon\u201d].)\n\f Section 1043 does not delineate the scope of the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to enter into rehabilitation agreements,\nbut that authority is presumed to be limited by the provisions in\nthe other statutes governing the conservatorship proceedings in\nsections 1010\u20131062. (Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court,\nsupra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 410.) One such statute is section\n1037, which lists various powers the commissioner has as the\nconservator of an insurer. Section 1037, subdivision (c) (section\n1037(c)) states that the commissioner \u201c[s]hall have authority to\ncompound, compromise or in any other manner negotiate\nsettlements of claims against that person upon such terms and\nconditions as the commissioner shall deem to be most\nadvantageous to the estate of the person being administered or\nliquidated or otherwise dealt with under this article.\u201d\n Because CIC sought to merge with an out-of-state entity\nand redomesticate in New Mexico, sections 1071.5 and 1072 are\nalso relevant here. Section 1071.5 states, \u201cEvery insurer which\nwithdraws as an insurer, or is required to withdraw as an\ninsurer, from this State shall, prior to such withdrawal, discharge\nits liabilities to residents of this State. In the case of its policies\ninsuring residents of this State it shall cause the primary\nliabilities under such policies to be reinsured and assumed by\nanother admitted insurer. In the case of such policies as are\nsubject to cancellation by the insurer, it may cancel such policies\npursuant to the terms thereof in lieu of such reinsurance and\nassumption.\u201d Section 1072 provides that if the commissioner\nexamines the books and records of a withdrawing insurer and\n\fdetermines that \u201cthe insurer has no outstanding liabilities to\nresidents of this State and no policies in favor of the residents of\nthis State uncanceled or the primary liabilities under which have\nnot been reinsured and assumed by another admitted insurer, as\nrequired by Section 1071.5, he shall cancel the insurer\u2019s\ncertificates of authority, if unexpired, and he shall permit the\ninsurer to withdraw. The commissioner may, in his discretion,\nwaive any or all of the above requirements if, after such\nexamination, he finds it to be in a solvent condition.\u201d\n 1. Section 2.6\u2019s settlement of the RPA litigation\n a. Relationship to basis for conservatorship\n CIC offers multiple reasons why the provision of the\nrehabilitation plan allowing CIC\u2019s policyholders to settle their\nclaims against CIC is legally unauthorized, but none has merit.\nMost generally, CIC contends the RPA litigation was not the\nbasis for the conservatorship and settlement of the RPA litigation\nis therefore not necessary to address the reasons for the\nconservatorship. The commissioner disputes whether section\n1012 requires each aspect of a rehabilitation plan to be limited to\nthe original grounds for the conservatorship, pointing out that\nsection 1012 states that a conservatorship ends when the court\nconcludes that the circumstances that gave rise to it no longer\nexist \u201cand that the person can properly resume title and\npossession of its property and the conduct of its business.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1012, italics added.) But he also maintains that settlement of\n\fthe RPA litigation is related to the grounds for the\nconservatorship.\n The language of section 1012 is broad, and the second\nclause is written in the present tense, suggesting that the\ncommissioner can include in a rehabilitation plan provisions\naimed at remediating flaws or issues he discovers in the\nconserved insurer during the course of the conservatorship that\nare not related to the reason for the conservatorship. But we\nneed not come to a definitive conclusion on this question.\nAssuming for the sake of argument that CIC is correct and a\nrehabilitation plan can only address the reasons for a\nconservatorship, the trial court and the commissioner reasonably\nconcluded that settlement of the RPA litigation does so. 5\n CIC attempted to merge without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval and depart the state because the commissioner refused\nto approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition of CIC. The Ninth Circuit\nrecently concluded as much, noting that Menzies merged CIC\nwith CIC II \u201cto bypass the California insurance regulatory regime\naltogether\u201d (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th\nat pp. 584\u2013585) \u201cand that the merger was an obvious attempt to\navoid the California insurance regulatory regime\u201d (id. at p. 597).\nThe commissioner refused to approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition\n\n5 CIC argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the second\n\ncondition in section 1012 for termination of a conservatorship,\nthat the insurer can properly resume title and possession of its\nbusiness, violates state administrative law and due process.\nBecause we do not rely on this aspect of section 1012 to affirm the\ntrial court\u2019s order, we need not examine these arguments.\n\fbecause of concerns about the RPA litigation. If the\ncommissioner had not placed CIC in conservatorship, CIC could\nhave merged, thereby thwarting the commissioner\u2019s ability to\nsatisfy himself regarding CIC\u2019s liability under the RPA litigation.\nEnding the conservatorship without also addressing the\ncommissioner\u2019s concerns about the RPA litigation therefore would\nhave failed to remedy the motivation behind it. CIC asserts that\nthe merger was intended only to avoid collapse of the Berkshire\nHathaway deal due to the commissioner\u2019s refusal to approve or\ndisapprove the transaction, but its account ignores the substance\nof why that deal almost collapsed.\n b. Mandated departure\n CIC objects that its departure from California cannot\njustify section 2.6 because its departure is not voluntary but\nrather mandated by section 2.4 of the plan. 6 CIC did not object to\nsection 2.4 in the trial court and does not object to it on appeal, so\nthis argument is not well taken. CIC\u2019s claims about a mandated\ndeparture also belie the history of this case. CIC began the\nprocess of merging with CIC II and redomesticating to allow the\nBerkshire Hathaway transaction to close. The Berkshire\nHathaway transaction did close, which was one of the New\n\n6 Section 2.4 of the rehabilitation plan states that on the\n\ndate the reinsurance and assumption agreement takes effect, the\ncommissioner as conservator \u201cshall effectuate the merger of CIC\ninto and with\u201d CIC II, \u201cthereby completing the attempted\nredomestication of CIC from California to New Mexico, and upon\nthe effective date of the merger of CIC into and with CIC II and\nthe transfer of the domicile of CIC to New Mexico, CIC shall\ncease to be a California domestic insurer.\u201d\n\fMexico superintendent\u2019s conditions of approval of the merger.\nCIC II also satisfied the other condition, which was that CIC II\nfile articles of merger with the New Mexico secretary of state. All\nthat remains is the filing of the certificate of merger with the\nCalifornia secretary of state. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) It is\nthus more accurate to say that sections 2.4 and 2.6 of the\nrehabilitation plan place conditions on the completion of the\ndeparture that is already under way.\n Given that CIC began the departure process without the\ncommissioner\u2019s approval and it is partly complete, the\ncommissioner is within his rights to place conditions on the\ncompletion of the departure. When an insurer follows the normal\nprocedure for withdrawal from the state by filing an application\nand surrendering its certificate to the commissioner (\u00a7 1070), the\n\u201cinsurer who has commenced the withdrawal process may not\nunilaterally terminate it and the Commissioner may condition\ntermination of the withdrawal process on appropriate remedial\naction by the insurer.\u201d (Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Gillespie\n(1990) 50 Cal.3d 82, 102 (Gillespie).) The commissioner must\nhave the same or greater authority over an insurer who is placed\nin conservatorship for attempting to extinguish its certificate\nthrough a merger and departure without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. (See \u00a7 701 [an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority \u201cshall\nexpire with the expiration or termination of a corporate existence\nof the holder thereof\u201d].)\n\f c. Statutory basis\n According to CIC, section 1071.5, which the trial court cited\nas authority supporting section 2.6, is inapplicable for several\nreasons, including that the RPA litigation claims are not\n\u201cliabilities\u201d of CIC within the meaning of section 1071.5 and\nrequiring it to settle litigation as a condition of withdrawing from\nthe state would violate its constitutional rights.\n CIC\u2019s interpretation of section 1071.5 is dubious, but we\nneed not examine CIC\u2019s contentions in detail because the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to fashion the rehabilitation plan does\nnot depend on section 1071.5. Section 1071.5 governs an\ninsurer\u2019s withdrawal from the state, so if CIC were simply trying\nto withdraw then section 1071.5 would govern. But CIC is not\nlike most withdrawing insurers. It is under conservatorship.\nSection 1037(c), which the trial court cited as supporting section\n2.6, allows the commissioner as conservator of an insurer to\n\u201ccompromise or in any other manner negotiate settlements of\nclaims against\u201d the conserved insurer. Sections 1012 and 1043\nalso empower the commissioner to enter into rehabilitation\nagreements to end a conservatorship. The commissioner\nreasonably concluded that settlement of the RPA litigation was\nnecessary to end the condition that gave rise to the\nconservatorship, as we concluded ante, so sections 1012, 1043,\nand 1037(c) provide sufficient authorization to support section\n2.6.\n CIC resists application of section 1037(c), arguing that\nstatute gives the commissioner authority to settle cases during\n\fthe conservatorship, not as a condition of exiting it. This gets\nthings backwards. As CIC itself notes, Commercial Nat. Bank v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at page 410 recognized\nthat the commissioner can reasonably exercise the state\u2019s police\npower and has authority under section 1043 to enter into\nrehabilitation agreements, subject to limitations in the other\nstatutes dealing with conservatorships. If section 1037(c)\nauthorizes settlements, that is no reason to think section 1043\ndoes not. CIC fails to show that the commissioner\u2019s section 1043\nauthority to use settlements to fashion a rehabilitation plan is\nnarrower than his section 1037(c) settlement authority during a\nconservatorship.\n d. Claims against affiliates\n CIC notes that section 1037(c) allows the commissioner as\nconservator to settle \u201cclaims against that person\u201d being\nconserved. It then argues that the RPA litigation mostly consists\nof claims against CIC\u2019s affiliates, not CIC itself. However, the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority in a conservatorship is not limited to\nthe entity being conserved. (Garamendi v. Executive Life Ins. Co.\n(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 504, 520, 523 (Garamendi).) A trial court\nmay assert in rem jurisdiction over assets of entities that have an\n\u201cidentity of interest\u201d with a conserved insurer and include them\nwithin the scope of the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan for an\ninsurer if it is reasonably necessary to promote the insurer\u2019s\nrehabilitation. (Ibid.) Garamendi relied in part on the fact that\ninsurance conservatorships are a state law equivalent of\nbankruptcy and that federal bankruptcy law asserts jurisdiction\n\fover entities that are legally separate from the debtor where\nnecessary to the successful administration of a debtor\u2019s estate.\n(Id. at pp. 515\u2013517.) But Garamendi also emphasized that \u201cthe\nbusiness of insurance is affected with a public interest,\u201d\n\u201cinsurance is a public asset,\u201d and creditors, policyholders, and the\npublic have an important stake in preserving the business of\ninsurers. (Id. at pp. 515\u2013516.)\n As the trial court ruled, Garamendi\u2019s holding supports\nsection 2.6 of the plan here. While there is no indication that CIC\nis insolvent, the commissioner\u2019s authority springs from the same\nstatutes that allow conservatorships in cases of insolvency and\nthe public has an interest in regulation and legally sound\noperation of insurers like CIC. CIC is correct that neither the\ncommissioner nor the trial court found that CIC\u2019s affiliates were\nalter egos of CIC, and the relationship between CIC and its\naffiliates is not exactly the same as the entities at issue in\nGaramendi. But nothing in Garamendi conditioned its assertion\nof in rem jurisdiction on an alter ego finding, and its rationale\nbased on the public interest in insurers also applies here.\n(Garamendi, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 516\u2013520, 523.)\n CIC and its affiliates operated the RPA and EquityComp\nprograms as a joint enterprise, dividing obligations and authority\nfor the express purpose of avoiding regulation by the\ncommissioner, as the commissioner found in Shasta Linen and as\nother courts have concluded. (E.g., Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1116\u20131117 [agreeing with Shasta Linen\nthat CIC and its affiliates \u201cwere \u2018so enmeshed\u2019 and \u2018intertwined\u2019\n\fthat they should be considered together in determining whether\nthe RPA constitutes a modification of the CIC policies\u201d]; Luxor\nCabs, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 986 [viewing \u201cEquityComp as a\nsingle, integrated insurance program\u201d despite the distinctions\nbetween CIC and its affiliates]; Applied Underwriters, Inc. v.\nLara, supra, 37 F.4th at pp. 592\u2013593 [discussing Garamendi with\napproval].) As one of these courts noted, \u201cObviously, allowing an\ninsurer to circumvent the comprehensive regulatory structure\napplicable to the issuance of workers\u2019 compensation insurance in\nthis state simply by amending its approved policy forms through\na side agreement with a subsidiary is contrary to the public\npolicy underlying California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law and\ncannot be countenanced.\u201d (Luxor Cabs, at p. 986.) The RPA\nlitigation has reflected this integrated relationship between CIC\nand its affiliates, since in at least one case, a federal court\naffirmed an arbitration award requiring a policyholder to pay\npremiums to CIC, over the policyholder\u2019s objection that CIC was\nnot a party to the arbitration. (American, Etc., Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (N.D. Cal. Dec. 28,\n2017, No. 17-cv-03660 DMR) 2017 WL 6622993, at *3\u2013*5.) In\nthese circumstances, excluding the RPA litigation from the\nrehabilitation plan because plaintiffs sued one of the other\nentities involved in the joint EquityComp program besides CIC\nwould thwart the commissioner\u2019s authority to remedy the\nproblem that gave rise to the conservatorship.\n\f e. Most advantageous terms\n CIC contends that section 1037(c) only allows settlement of\nclaims \u201cupon such terms and conditions as the commissioner\nshall deem to be most advantageous to the estate of the person\nbeing administered\u201d (\u00a7 1037(c)) and asserts the trial court did not\nfind that section 2.6\u2019s three settlement options are to CIC\u2019s\nadvantage.\n CIC\u2019s statement of the standard governing settlements by\nan insurance conservator is incomplete. While section 1037(c)\nrequires settlements to be most advantageous to the estate,\nsection 1057 declares that when acting as a conservator, \u201cthe\ncommissioner shall be deemed to be a trustee for the benefit of all\ncreditors and other persons interested in the estate of the person\nagainst whom the proceedings are pending.\u201d And as In re\nExecutive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at page 376\nexplained, the commissioner\u2019s actions are also inflected with the\npublic interest, given the character of insurance and that the\ncommissioner \u201cacts not only as a trustee but also as a servant of\nthe state in the exercise of its police power.\u201d \u201cOf necessity, if\nrequired to satisfy the public interest, the Commissioner\npossesses considerable discretion in settling claims.\u201d (Id. at\np. 381.) Thus, when deciding whether a settlement of claims\nagainst a conserved insurer is \u201cboth in the best interest of the\nconservancy estate and necessary to vindicate the public interest\u201d\n(ibid.), the commissioner must consider not just the insurer itself,\nbut also others interested in the insurer, such as policyholders or\ncreditors, as well as the public interest at stake. Additionally,\n\feven when a settlement of one claim cannot be justified on its\nown, it may be justified if it is part of a global settlement or\ncontributes to a near global settlement. (Id. at p. 382.)\n The trial court quoted In re Executive Life Ins. Co.\u2019s\nstatement of the standard for settlements, described how section\n2.6 offered the possibility of a settlement of the substantial\nmajority of the RPA litigation, described in detail the substantial\nevidence supporting the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that CIC faced\nsignificant legal exposure in the litigation, and found section 2.6\nhad a rational basis in its entirety. The import of the trial court\u2019s\ndecision is that the commissioner reasonably concluded the\nsection 2.6 settlement options were most advantageous to the\npublic interest and the estate because of CIC\u2019s potential liability.\n Regarding CIC\u2019s potential liability, the trial court found\nsubstantial evidence supported the commissioner\u2019s belief that the\nRPA was void. Section 2.6\u2019s first settlement option reflects this\npossibility, since it would allow policyholders to settle by paying\nonly what they owe under the guaranteed cost policy. The trial\ncourt recognized that policyholders could also enforce the RPA,\ndespite its illegality, to prevent unjust enrichment to CIC.\nSection 2.6\u2019s third settlement option represents this possibility,\nsince it would allow policyholders to enforce the guaranteed cost\npolicies and the RPA in full, which might result in a payment to\nCIC.\n The trial court found that CIC could also be liable under\nthe Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.\n(UCL)) for engaging in unlawful acts based on the failure to file\n\fthe RPA for approval, unfair acts by using an unfiled insurance\npolicy that was not disclosed until after the policyholders were\nalready bound, and fraudulent practices by misrepresenting the\nEquityComp plan in marketing materials. The trial court found\nsection 2.6\u2019s second settlement option \u2014 which would allow\npolicyholders to obtain restitution of any amounts they paid over\nthe cost of a standard, approved retrospective rating plan \u2014 to be\na reasonable approach to calculating quantum meruit restitution,\nwhich would be a remedy for UCL violations.\n CIC does not mention, let alone dispute, any of the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions regarding its potential liability under these\ntheories. Instead, it contends that a global settlement is not to\nCIC\u2019s advantage and violates its due process rights because CIC\ndefeated all attempts to certify classes of policyholders, the\nsettlement would prevent CIC from challenging each plaintiff\u2019s\nevidence, and it would require CIC to forfeit potentially\nmeritorious individual defenses, including showing that a\nplaintiff had suffered no damages. CIC also points out that its\nShasta Linen settlement with the department acknowledged that\nthe legality of the RPA was \u201cfor the courts to decide\u201d and asserts\nthat it prevailed in RPA litigation on numerous grounds.\n We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s and\ncommissioner\u2019s conclusions that CIC faces significant enough\nliability under the RPA litigation that it is most advantageous to\nCIC, policyholders, creditors, and the public for the commissioner\nto offer to settle on the terms in section 2.6. (See In re Executive\nLife Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 358 [courts must affirm\n\frehabilitation plan if it is not arbitrary, discriminatory, contrary\nto a specific statute, or a breach of the conservator\u2019s fiduciary\nduty as trustee].)\n The Shasta Linen settlement\u2019s statement about the courts\ndeciding the legality of the RPA is of no consequence, since it\npredated CIC\u2019s attempted unauthorized merger to evade the\ncommissioner\u2019s consideration of the RPA litigation and the\nresulting conservatorship. The settlement also reserved the\ncommissioner\u2019s right to \u201cinitiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d Nothing in the settlement precludes section\n2.6.\n The trial court considered CIC\u2019s claim of substantial\nsuccess in the RPA litigation and reasonably found it\nunpersuasive. CIC did prevail in defeating class certification\nmotions, but those rulings have no bearing on the merits of any\nindividual policyholder\u2019s claims. The fact that the RPA litigants\nwere unable to satisfy the procedural requirements for class\naction due to individualized issues, as CIC asserts, is irrelevant\nto deciding whether the global settlement and the application of\nthe three settlement options is in CIC\u2019s interest. Section 2.6 does\nnot vitiate CIC\u2019s class certification victories in any event. The\npolicyholders eligible to settle under section 2.6 are those who\nalready filed claims, those whom CIC identifies as potentially\nowing CIC payments, and ten policyholders who had already\n\fsubmitted claims to the conservator. CIC does not contend that\nthese categories encompass the same number of policyholders\nthat a class action would have.\n Apart from class certification motions, the victories CIC\ncites primarily concern enforcement of arbitrability delegation or\nforum selection clauses in courts in other states or piecemeal\ndismissals of individual causes of action. These limited successes\ndo not show that CIC has a strong likelihood of ultimately\ndefeating policyholders\u2019 suits as a whole. The record as a whole\ncontains substantial evidence that policyholders prevailed more\noften in showing the RPA, or portions of it, to be void and\nunenforceable, especially after the issuance of the Court of\nAppeal decisions beginning with Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th 1096. CIC points out that the Court of Appeal\ndecisions the trial court cited concern the enforceability of the\narbitration agreement within the RPA, rather than the RPA\nitself. (E.g., id. at p. 1121, fn. 6 [decision was limited to factual\nrecord on the hearing on motion to compel and did not preclude\nparties from litigating merits of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action\nregarding the RPA].) This argument ignores that the same\ngrounds for invalidating an arbitration agreement within a\ncontract can provide a stronger basis for invalidating the entire\ncontract. (Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S.\n63, 71 [\u201cIn some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the\ncontract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the\nsame basis as applied only to the severable agreement to\n\farbitrate\u201d].) Moreover, other decisions the commissioner cited\ndeclared the entire RPA invalid.\n CIC notes that some decisions have found a policyholder\nliable for unpaid premiums regardless of the RPA\u2019s illegality.\n(E.g., Applied Underwriting, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb.\nAug. 2, 2018, No. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4.)\nAgain, there are decisions going the other direction.\nAdditionally, litigation of many of the cases was stayed because\nof the initiation of the conservatorship. Given that the\nEquityComp system was structured as a combination of the\nguaranteed cost policies and the RPA and that the commissioner\nsupplied an actuary\u2019s opinion that CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npremiums were roughly 33 percent higher than market rates, the\ntrial court could reasonably conclude that courts or arbitrators in\nthe future (including appellate courts, in cases where CIC had\nprevailed or would likely prevail in a lower court) would find it\nunfair and inequitable to enforce just the guaranteed cost plan\nrates after finding the RPA to be illegal. 7\n\n7 CIC disputes the 33 percent figure, claiming the actuary\n\nonly said in his deposition that the 33 percent figure was his\n\u201cimpression\u201d and relied on no data. CIC also notes that it\nprovided an actuarial expert\u2019s analysis that found CIC\u2019s rates\nwere in the middle of the market. But the department\u2019s actuary\nexplained elsewhere that CIC\u2019s rates were based on the loss\ntrends of its policy portfolio and those loss trends were higher\nthan the loss trends for the industry as a whole. The department\nalso noted in its reply that CIC\u2019s actuarial analysis was based on\nfiled rates, not the rates CIC actually charged, and did not reflect\nthat CIC\u2019s rates were higher than the industry-wide average\ndespite CIC not insuring policyholders with the highest losses.\n\f In short, the evidence from CIC and the commissioner\ndemonstrates at best that CIC has had limited success in the\nRPA litigation. This is not sufficient to show an abuse of\ndiscretion by the trial court or commissioner in finding section\n2.6\u2019s settlement options to be most advantageous to CIC\u2019s estate\nand interested third parties. Considering California\u2019s strong\npublic policy favoring the settlement of disputes (Rheinhart v.\nNissan North America, Inc. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1027)\nand the costs of litigation, the trial court could reasonably\ndetermine that settlement was beneficial to CIC here, especially\nbecause it would expedite the end of the conservatorship.\nAdditionally, settlement of a claim that may not be justified on\nits own can be justified as part of a global or near-global\nsettlement. (In re Executive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 382.) Even if CIC might have defeated some of the RPA\ncases on the merits based on individualized defenses or had a net\nrecovery after some plaintiffs\u2019 damages were offset against\npremiums still owing to CIC or its affiliates, the trial court and\ncommissioner reasonably decided that it was most advantageous\nto achieve a near-global settlement, with the resulting litigation\ncost savings, by offering the three settlement options in section\n2.6.\n\nThe department\u2019s analysis constitutes substantial evidence, so\nthe trial court was entitled to decide which of these competing\nanalyses it found most persuasive.\n\f f. More favorable settlement\n CIC challenges option 2 specifically as offering RPA\nplaintiffs a more favorable outcome than they could have\nobtained through litigation because it calculates the fair market\nvalue of the benefits under the EquityComp plan by using a\ngeneral retrospective rating plan rather than one that CIC\noffered. Option 2 represents the commissioner\u2019s attempt to use a\ngeneric retrospective policy approved by the commissioner to\ncalculate the fair market value of the coverage a policyholder\nreceived from CIC, which CIC would be entitled to retain under\nthe UCL even if a plaintiff prevailed. As the trial court noted,\nfair market value is commonly defined as that amount \u201cthat\n\u2018hypothetical buyers and sellers\u2019 would pay in a \u2018hypothetical\ntransaction.\u2019 \u201d (Long Beach Memorial Medical Center v. Kaiser\nFoundation Health Plan, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 323, 343, 345\n[discussing measure of damages under quantum meruit claim,\nwhich was identical to restitution under UCL]; see also id. at\np. 346 [defining fair market value based on hypothetical\ntransactions \u201cis affirmatively helpful because it emphasizes\nanother pertinent legal principle \u2014 namely, that the parties\u2019\nprior actual transactions are not dipositive\u201d].) Option 2 therefore\nrepresents a reasonable approximation of a remedy that RPA\nplaintiffs might obtain through litigation, but it avoids the costs\nof litigation CIC would otherwise incur.\n 2. Reinsurance of CIC\u2019s policies under section 2.2\n Besides section 2.6\u2019s settlement options for the RPA\nlitigation, CIC also challenges the trial court\u2019s approval of section\n\f2.2 of the plan, which requires CIC to enter into a reinsurance\nand assumption agreement for its California policies. \u201cA\nreinsurance contract is \u2018one by which an insurer procures a third\nperson to insure him [i.e., the insurer] against loss or liability by\nreason of such original insurance.\u2019 (\u00a7 620.) If the agreement is\npurely for reinsurance, it benefits only the insurer; the original\ninsured has no interest in it (\u00a7 623) and acquires no rights under\nit. [Citation.] Such an agreement clearly cannot operate to\nrelieve the original insurer of any obligation to the insured. [\u00b6] A\ncontract by which a reinsurer assumes the policies of the original\ninsurer does result in the reinsurer being directly liable to the\noriginal insureds [citation], but it does not release the original\ninsurer, which remains jointly obligated with the reinsurer\n[citations.].\u201d (Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at pp. 95\u201396, italics\nomitted.)\n CIC\u2019s first argument is that section 2.2 improperly requires\nthe sale of over 85 percent of its business to end the\nconservatorship, which is tantamount to liquidation. CIC points\nout that liquidation is supposed to be the last resort in a\nconservatorship. (Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 329.) But\nliquidation entails distributing an insurer\u2019s assets to creditors,\nand it is a last resort because it dissolves the company and\ndeprives policyholders of insurance protection. (Ibid.) CIC, by\ncontrast, will retain any proceeds from the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement, rather than distributing them to its\ncreditors, so section 2.2 is not a liquidation. Section 2.2 also does\n\fnot deprive any policyholders of insurance protection, so it need\nnot be a last resort like liquidation.\n Although CIC briefly suggests otherwise, reinsurance is\nwithin the commissioner\u2019s express authority as conservator.\nSection 1043 states that \u201cthe commissioner, as conservator or as\nliquidator, may, subject to the approval of said court, and subject\nto such liens as may be necessary mutualize or reinsure the\nbusiness of such person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements.\u201d\nThere can be no question that the commissioner has the\nnecessary authority.\n CIC claims that the commissioner could have pursued less\nonerous alternatives, including allowing CIC to continue to\nservice its policies after leaving the state. As noted ante, CIC\u2019s\nattempted merger with CIC II would have led to it departing\nfrom California, functionally equivalent to a withdrawal from the\nstate. Before withdrawing from the state, an insurer must\n\u201cdischarge its liabilities to residents of this State,\u201d including\ncausing its policies \u201cto be reinsured and assumed by another\nadmitted insurer.\u201d (\u00a7 1071.5.) The commissioner will then cancel\nthe withdrawing insurer\u2019s certificates of authority and allow the\ninsurer to withdraw. (\u00a7 1072.) Section 1072 gives the\ncommissioner discretion to waive this requirement if he finds the\nwithdrawing insurer to be solvent. (Ibid.)\n The default assumption of sections 1071.5 and 1072 is that\na withdrawing insurer will have its remaining policies reinsured\nand assumed by an admitted insurer. The commissioner\nreasonably decided to the take the same approach with CIC given\n\fthat its merger was functionally a withdrawal from the state.\nCIC protests that Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at page 99 held that\nan insurer that withdraws can still service its policies from out of\nstate, as demonstrated by the fact that section 1072 allows the\ncommissioner to waive the reinsurance and assumption\nrequirement for a solvent insurer. This is true, but the\ncommissioner still retains the discretion over whether to waive\nthe reinsurance and assumption requirement. (\u00a7 1072 [\u201cThe\ncommissioner may, in his discretion, waive any or all of the above\nrequirements . . . \u201d].) The trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin not requiring the commissioner to waive the presumptive\nrequirement of reinsurance and assumption here, where CIC\nattempted to merge and depart from California without the\ncommissioner\u2019s consent and with the purpose of evading the\ncommissioner\u2019s review of its handling of the RPA litigation. 8\n(Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 597\n[CIC merger \u201cwas an obvious attempt to avoid the California\ninsurance regulatory regime\u201d].)\n In its second challenge to section 2.2, CIC argues the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by approving the specific provision\nthat requires that any reinsurer who is affiliated with CIC, such\nas Continental, to use a third-party claims administrator. CIC\n\n8 The trial court also found the reinsurance and assumption\n\nrequirement justified based on evidence that CIC\u2019s management\nhad repeatedly evaded the commissioner\u2019s regulatory authority,\nboth before and during the conservatorship. Much, if not all, of\nthe evidence of this evasion provides further support for the trial\ncourt\u2019s order, but it is not necessary to consider it because CIC\u2019s\nconduct giving rise to the conservatorship is sufficient on its own.\n\fargues that the department proposed the third-party\nadministrator condition for a CIC-affiliated reinsurer without\nevidence to support it and then tried and failed to justify it\nretroactively.\n The trial court found the commissioner reasonably insisted\non a third-party claims administrator if Continental or another\nCIC affiliate reinsured and assumed CIC\u2019s policies, based in part\non the fact that Continental is operated by the same management\nas CIC, including Menzies as the president and chief executive\nofficer. The trial court also found substantial evidence showed\nthat CIC had not treated policyholders fairly by (1) increasing\npayouts on claims or inflating the reserves necessary for claims,\nthereby triggering higher costs for policyholders; and (2) keeping\nclaims open to postpone having to return unused premiums to the\npolicyholders, so that CIC could maximize the investment returns\nit made on the funds.\n We find substantial evidentiary support for all three points.\nFirst, the record shows that Menzies is Continental\u2019s president\nand chief executive officer and Jeffrey Silver is its Secretary.\nMenzies and Silver hold similar roles in CIC as well as AUCRA,\nwhich is another of the entities involved in the RPA and the\nEquityComp program. Given the identical management,\nallowing Continental to reinsure and assume CIC\u2019s policies and\ncontinue servicing claims would defeat the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement\u2019s purpose of protecting policyholders from\nmanagement that has demonstrated its willingness to attempt to\nevade the commissioner\u2019s oversight. It would essentially change\n\fthe nameplate on the door but allow the business to continue to\noperate as usual. This alone is sufficient to support the third-\nparty administrator requirement.\n Second, the commissioner submitted evidence showing that\nthe EquityComp program incentivized CIC to increase payments\nor reserves for claims unnecessarily and that CIC in fact did so.\nRegarding the incentive, most retrospective rating plans increase\nthe premiums a policyholder pays linearly as losses increase, up\nto a maximum premium. But the EquityComp plan increased\npremiums steeply for the initial portion of losses to a certain\namount, then raised premiums more slowly if losses continued to\nincrease. If CIC overpaid claims and thereby increased its losses,\nor if it set an artificially high estimate of reserves necessary to\npay losses on a claim in the future, it could trigger the initial\nsteep increase in premiums that policyholders would have to pay.\nCounsel for plaintiffs in many of the RPA cases, Larry J.\nLichtenegger, submitted a declaration detailing specific instances\nin which CIC\u2019s overpayment of employee claims increased\npolicyholders\u2019 costs, including one in which a putatively injured\nformer employee was working for a competitor, and CIC verified\nthe fraud but continued paying the former employee. The\ncommissioner also cited the Shasta Linen case, which relayed a\npolicyholder\u2019s account of CIC\u2019s failure to investigate potential\nfraud on a claim that cost the policyholder over $100,000.\n(Shasta Linen, supra, at p. 38.)\n Finally, the commissioner provided evidence that CIC kept\nclaims open to retain policyholders\u2019 funds longer, to maximize\n\fCIC\u2019s profits. The EquityComp program was structured to allow\nAUCRA (the CIC-affiliated reinsurer that took risk and\npremiums from CIC and passed them back to the policyholders)\nto require policyholders to post collateral to secure their payment\nof additional premiums due to losses. Setting high collateral\namounts for future losses benefited CIC and its affiliates because\nCIC could earn investment returns on the collateral and did not\nhave to share the returns with the policyholders. CIC followed\nthese incentives in several cases documented in Lichtenegger\u2019s\ndeclaration. For example, CIC refused to accept an employee\u2019s\noffer to settle a claim for less than the amount of reserves set\naside for the claim, even though the policyholder, which would\nincur the cost for the settlement, wanted to pay it in order to\nhave CIC refund the excess reserves.\n In response to this evidence, CIC cites evidence that the\ndepartment allowed CIC to continue to handle claims during the\nconservatorship and CIC was rated highly in claims handling in\nstate audits. CIC also attacks Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility,\nasserting, among other things, that he and his clients were\nobviously self-interested and arguing that he cited very few\nspecific examples of claims handling. Finally, CIC argues,\nprimarily in a footnote, that it submitted a declaration by an\nexpert who reviewed CIC\u2019s files for the policyholders mentioned\nand refuted Lichtenegger\u2019s allegations.\n The trial court reasonably rejected or discounted CIC\u2019s\narguments. The commissioner could reasonably conclude that his\noversight and that of his representatives, including being\n\fphysically present at CIC\u2019s offices in Nebraska, were sufficient to\ndeter CIC from its prior abusive practices. CIC\u2019s high marks in\naudits of its claims handling do not undercut the commissioner\u2019s\nevidence of overpayments. As the trial court noted, the audits\nlooked for evidence of underpayments, not overpayments, so\nCIC\u2019s high scores do not refute the evidence that CIC was\noverpaying claims to collect higher premiums from its\npolicyholders. And Lichtenegger\u2019s declaration did not purport to\nprovide an exhaustive description of all of his clients\u2019 qualms\nabout CIC\u2019s claims handling, so the quantity of examples he cited\nis not disqualifying. Although Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility was\nlegitimately open to question for various reasons (including his\nposition as advocate for policyholders with RPA litigation claims\nagainst CIC), credibility decisions were for the trial court and the\ncommissioner to make. The court and commissioner could\nreasonably decide to rely on Lichtenegger, given his unique\nfamiliarity with the experiences of many different policyholders.\nAlthough CIC\u2019s expert declaration provided the trial court an\nalternative view of the evidence, the trial court was ultimately\nfaced with conflicting evidence on both sides, and CIC\u2019s evidence\nrelating to its claims handling was not so overwhelming as to\nundercut the value of the commissioner\u2019s evidence as a matter of\nlaw.\n In sum, we are unpersuaded that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by approving section 2.2.\n DISPOSITION\n The trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\n\f BROWN, P.

ECF Nos. 50; 52. Defendant, the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d),\n\nopposes the Motion. ECF No. 51. Because Eddington fails to show he is eligible for attorneys\u2019\n\nfees, the Court recommends that Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nEddington is a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, which he refers to as \u201ca leading think\n\ntank dedicated to promoting individual liberty.\u201d Decl. of Patrick G. Eddington, ECF No. 50-1 \u00b6\u00b6\n\n3\u20134. Eddington\u2019s research and publications focus on domestic surveillance and political\n\nrepression. Id. \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Eddington filed a FOIA request with the National Security Division\n\n(\u201cNSD\u201d) of the DOJ. Id. \u00b6 6. Eddington sought records from June 3, 2015, to May 15, 2019,\n\nconcerning the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective\n\nDiscipline Over Monitoring Act of 2015 (\u201cUSA FREEDOM\u201d). Id. at 4\u20135.1 According to\n Citations throughout this Report and Recommendation are to the page numbers in a filing\u2019s\nECF header.\n\fEddington, the Act placed conditions on the Government\u2019s collection of citizens\u2019\n\ntelecommunications metadata. Id. \u00b6 7. Eddington\u2019s FOIA request had two parts: \u201c1) internal or\n\nexternal reports on the efficacy of programs carried out under [USA FREEDOM], including\n\nsolicited or unsolicited feedback from agents or intelligence analysts, whether formal or informal\n\nin nature; and 2) any correspondence dealing with the termination or initiation of programs\n\nconducted under [USA FREEDOM].\u201d Id. at 4.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, the DOJ acknowledged receipt of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request. Id. at \u00b6\n\n10, 6. The DOJ informed Eddington that it processed requests \u201con a first-in, first-out basis.\u201d Id.\n\nat 6. The DOJ also noted that the processing time for Eddington\u2019s request would depend on the\n\ncomplexity of the request, whether the request involved sensitive information or many records,\n\nand whether the DOJ needed to consult with other agencies to process the request. Id.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nEddington filed suit less than a month later, on July 12, 2019. ECF No. 1. In the\n\nComplaint, he requested that the DOJ conduct a reasonable search and produce all non-exempt\n\nrequested records. Id. at 2\u20133. The DOJ answered the Complaint on August 27, 2019. ECF No.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, the Parties filed their first joint status report (\u201cJSR\u201d), in which the\n\nDOJ stated it was \u201cin the process of conducting its searches\u201d for responsive records. ECF No. 11\n\n\u00b6 2. The DOJ noted it had to seek those records from individual custodians, as there was no\n\ncentralized database. Id. The DOJ anticipated completing its search by October 31, 2019. Id. On\n\nthat date, the DOJ informed the Court that it had completed its search for part one of Eddington\u2019s\n\nFOIA request and found no responsive records. ECF No. 12 \u00b6 2. The Parties also discussed\n\nnarrowing part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request to exclude internal communications. ECF Nos.\n\f12 \u00b6 2; 13 \u00b6 2. The DOJ claimed that including those communications in its search would cause a\n\ndelay in any document production. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 2; 14 \u00b6 2. The Parties, however, did not reach\n\nan agreement on narrowing part two of the request. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 3; 14 \u00b6 3.\n\nIn January 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it estimated completing its search for\n\npart two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request by March 3, 2020. ECF No. 14 \u00b6 4. On that date, the DOJ\n\ntold Eddington that it had completed its search and was reviewing results. ECF Nos. 51\u20131; 17 \u00b6\n\n4. The DOJ stated it would provide Eddington with another response by May 3, 2020. ECF No.\n\n51\u20131. On March 17, 2020, however, the agency informed the Court that the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nwould impact its ability to timely process records and issue a response. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 13, 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it could not provide another response\n\nor production schedule because the DOJ\u2019s telework policies prevented access to a classified server\n\non which the responsive records were kept. ECF No. 19 \u00b6 4. These access restrictions continued\n\nuntil April 2022. See ECF Nos. 20 \u00b6 4; 38 \u00b6 3.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, the DOJ stated it had recently resumed processing Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest and had located approximately 600 potentially-responsive pages. ECF No. 38 \u00b6 4. The\n\nDOJ\u2019s processing involved coordination with other government agencies, including the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). ECF Nos. 38 \u00b6 5; 50-1 \u00b6 11; 51-3. On December 16, 2022, the\n\nFBI produced a redacted and previously-sealed declaration that the Government had filed in the\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ECF Nos. 50-1 at 7\u201324; 51-3.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, the DOJ issued its final response to part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest. ECF Nos. 41 \u00b6 5; 51-2. The DOJ informed Eddington that it had located seventy-two\n\npages of responsive records, all of which the DOJ withheld pursuant to various FOIA exemptions.\n\nECF No. 51-2. Eddington did not challenge any of the agency\u2019s withholdings or redactions. ECF\n\fNo. 50-1 \u00b6 14. On March 29, 2024, Eddington filed this Motion for an award of $18,980.15 in\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees and costs. ECF Nos. 50; 52.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to FOIA\u2019s fee recovery provision, a court may assess reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n\nand litigation costs against the United States in a case \u201cin which the complainant has substantially\n\nprevailed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). The objectives of this provision are twofold: 1) to\n\nencourage FOIA litigation that benefits the public interest when private interest is lacking; and 2)\n\nto compensate plaintiffs for enduring an agency\u2019s unreasonable stonewalling in complying with\n\nFOIA\u2019s requirements. See Kwoka v. Internal Revenue Serv., 989 F.3d 1058, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\n\nEven if the Court deems the plaintiff a prevailing party under the FOIA statute, a fee award is not\n\nautomatic. See Morley v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 894 F.3d 389, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam)\n\n(noting that FOIA states that the Court \u201cmay\u201d award fees to a prevailing plaintiff, not that the\n\nCourt \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d). The Court retains broad discretion in deciding whether to award fees.\n\nSee Hall & Assocs. v. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 210 F. Supp. 3d 13, 19 (D.D.C. 2016) (citations\n\nomitted), aff\u2019d per curiam, No. 16-5315, 2018 WL 1896493 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 9, 2018)\n\n(unpublished).\n\nTo recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under FOIA, a plaintiff must be both eligible for and\n\nentitled to fees. Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 811 F.3d 22, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2016). If a\n\nplaintiff is eligible and entitled, they may recover a fee award that is reasonable. Urb. Air\n\nInitiative, Inc. v. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 442 F. Supp. 3d 301, 310 (D.D.C. 2020) (citations omitted).\n\f I. Eddington Is Not Eligible to Recover Attorneys\u2019 Fees Because He Has Failed to\n Establish That He Substantially Prevailed in This Lawsuit.\n\nA. Legal Standard\n\nOne of the ways a plaintiff can show they substantially prevailed in the litigation is by\n\nestablishing that they obtained relief through \u201ca voluntary or unilateral change in position by the\n\nagency, if the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim [was] not insubstantial.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(ii). This is\n\nreferred to as the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d Grand Canyon Tr. v. Bernhardt, 947 F.3d 94, 95 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2020) (per curiam).\n\nUnder the catalyst theory, the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that, but\n\nfor the plaintiff filing suit, the agency would not have performed the desired act, such as producing\n\nrecords. Id. at 97 (citations omitted); see Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Harris, 653 F.2d 584,\n\n587 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting this is a question of causation). Courts look at the totality of the\n\ncircumstances to determine whether there is a causal nexus between a plaintiff filing suit and an\n\nagency\u2019s change in position. See Conservation Force v. Jewell, 160 F. Supp. 3d 194, 202 (D.D.C.\n\n2016) (citation omitted). If factors unrelated to the lawsuit trigger an agency\u2019s disclosure, the\n\nplaintiff has not demonstrated causation and is not a prevailing party under the catalyst theory.\n\nGrand Canyon Tr. v. Zinke, 311 F. Supp. 3d 381, 389 (D.D.C. 2018), aff\u2019d sub nom. Grand Canyon\n\nTr., 947 F.3d 94.\n\nAlthough timing may be relevant in this analysis, a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a complaint and an\n\nagency\u2019s subsequent disclosure is not enough to show causation. See Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d\n\nat 97; see also Pub. L. Educ. Inst. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 744 F.2d 181, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating\n\nsomething \u201cmore than post hoc, ergo propter hoc must be shown\u201d). There must be \u201chard evidence\u201d\n\nbeyond timing that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit caused the agency to release documents or provide other\n\nrequested relief. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, the Court may\n\fconsider whether the agency had a reasonable amount of time to respond to a FOIA request before\n\nthe plaintiff filed suit. See First Look Inst. Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, No. 20-cv-3499,\n\n2024 WL 3744818, at *4 (D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2024) (collecting cases), report and recommendation\n\nadopted sub nom. First Look Media Works, Inc. v.

Cir. July 2, 2025) (unpublished). The\n\nCourt also considers whether unavoidable external factors caused an agency\u2019s delay, including\n\ninadvertent administrative constraints. See Env\u2019t Integrity Project v. United States Env\u2019t Prot.\n\nAgency, 316 F. Supp. 3d 320, 328 (D.D.C. 2018).\n\nB. Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\nEddington makes a half-hearted argument that he is eligible for fees under the catalyst\n\ntheory.2 ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. His only meaningful argument is that the lawsuit caused\n\na \u201csudden acceleration\u201d of the DOJ\u2019s production. ECF No. 50 at 4. Under that theory, Eddington\n\npoints to two pieces of alleged \u201chard evidence.\u201d Id. at 5-6. He asserts that the DOJ \u201cimmediately\n\nbegan processing\u201d his request once he filed suit because the DOJ stated in the Parties\u2019 first JSR\n\nthat the agency was in the process of conducting searches. ECF Nos. 1; 50 at 5; see also ECF No.\n\n11 \u00b6 2. Relying on the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report,3 Eddington contrasts the nearly four-month\n\nperiod between his May 15, 2019 FOIA request and the Parties\u2019 first JSR, with the DOJ\u2019s average\n Indeed, he devoted only two paragraphs in his opening Motion to this argument.\n Each fiscal year, agencies must publicly report certain statistical information concerning\ntheir FOIA processes to the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Government\nInformation Services. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e). Courts in this District have relied on these reports\nin FOIA cases. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. C.I.A., 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 259 n.14 (D.D.C. 2012),\naff\u2019d, 969 F.3d 406 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\n\fprocessing time in the NSD of over one year for \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests.4 ECF No. 50 at 5\u20136.\n\nEddington claims that the disparity between the average processing time and the time it took for\n\nthe DOJ to start processing his FOIA request shows that it is \u201clikely\u201d that the DOJ would not have\n\nprocessed his request as soon as it did absent this lawsuit. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135.\n\nEddington also asserts that the DOJ failed to provide evidence of its pre-suit processing steps.\n\nECF No. 52 at 4\u20135.\n\nThe DOJ argues that Eddington fails to provide any \u201cevidence that this suit caused [the\n\nDOJ] to change what it already was doing with respect to the FOIA request.\u201d ECF No. 51 at 8.\n\nThe DOJ first argues that it is not the case that the agency failed to communicate with Eddington\n\nprior to his lawsuit because the agency let him know it was processing the request. Id. at 7. The\n\nDOJ sent a letter on June 17, 2019, informing Eddington that it would process his request as\n\nquickly as possible consistent with the agency\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and the administrative\n\ndemands of the request. Id. at 7, 10\u201311; see also ECF No. 50-1 at 6. Second, the DOJ argues that\n\nthe DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report does not provide any conclusive evidence of a \u201csudden acceleration\u201d\n\nin this case. ECF No. 51 at 11\u201312. Among other things, the agency points out that the Report\n\nsimply provides averages from one fiscal year, which necessarily means that there were requests\n\nthat were processed in less time than the average. Id. at 11. The agency also points out that the\n\nReport fails to account for other \u201cunforeseen contingent events that may operate to quicken or slow\n\ndown the processing of a FOIA request.\u201d Id. The DOJ also notes that Eddington\u2019s argument\n\nhinges entirely on FOIA statistics from 2019 despite the DOJ not completing processing in this\n\ncase until January 2023. Id. at 12.\n See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., United States Department of Justice Annual Freedom of\nInformation Act Report: Fiscal Year 2019 34 (2019) (\u201c2019 FOIA Report\u201d),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1253751/dl?inline=.\n\f C. Discussion\n\nEddington has failed to establish that it is more probable than not that his lawsuit caused\n\nthe DOJ to change its pre-suit position on his FOIA request. Eddington asks the Court to find that\n\nhe has substantially prevailed in this lawsuit based solely on the proposition that the NSD\u2019s average\n\ntime in 2019 for fully processing a complex FOIA request was greater than the time it took for the\n\nagency to start processing Eddington\u2019s request. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that this alleged disparity establishes the DOJ \u201csuddenly accelerated\u201d processing\n\nbecause Eddington filed suit. ECF No. 50 at 4.\n\nCourts in this District have concluded that an agency\u2019s \u201csudden acceleration\u201d in processing\n\na FOIA request after a plaintiff files suit may show that the lawsuit caused the agency to change\n\nits position. Terris, Pravlik & Millian, LLP v. Cents. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., 794 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 29, 38 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Crooker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 663 F.2d 140 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1980)). This necessarily means that a plaintiff must first show that the agency initially took\n\nan adverse position on the FOIA request or engaged in an unexplained delay before the plaintiff\n\nfiled suit. See First Look Media Works, Inc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *4. A plaintiff must then\n\nprove that \u201cthe agency did in fact accelerate its response to the FOIA request because of the\n\nlawsuit.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Eddington does not make either showing.\n\nEddington fails to show that the DOJ initially took an adverse position on his FOIA request\n\nor engaged in a significant and unexplained pre-suit delay. See Am. Wild Horse Campaign v. U.S.\n\nBureau of Land Mgmt., No. 22-cv-3061, 2024 WL 3967256, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 26, 2024) (noting\n\nthat an agency\u2019s significant delay can support an inference that the agency forgot about or ignored\n\nthe request). Although the DOJ does not provide a declaration explaining its pre-suit processing,\n\nEddington\u2019s own evidence shows that the agency was aware of his FOIA request. ECF No. 50-1\n\fat 6. The agency sent Eddington a response within thirty-three days of his FOIA request. Id. \u00b6 10.\n\nIn that pre-suit letter, the agency informed Eddington that it would process his request as quickly\n\nas possible in line with the DOJ\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and other administrative demands. Id.\n\nat 6; see Grand Canyon Tr., 311 F. Supp. 3d at 390 (holding that plaintiff was not eligible for fees\n\ndespite the agency\u2019s failure to produce a declaration). Accordingly, this is not a case in which the\n\nagency ignored the FOIA request, took an adverse pre-suit position, or delayed significantly in\n\ngetting back to Eddington.\n\nMoreover, Eddington filed suit only fifty-eight days after making his FOIA request and\n\nonly twenty-five days after the agency first responded to him. ECF No. 50-1 at \u00b6 10. This further\n\nundermines the argument that there was some supposed pre-suit delay. First Look Media Works,\n\nInc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *5; Am. Wild Horse Campaign, 2024 WL 3967256, at *1, *3 (finding\n\nthe plaintiff was not eligible for fees despite the agency failing to communicate pre-suit with the\n\nplaintiff for eight months after confirming receipt). Eddington cannot manufacture a \u201csudden\n\nacceleration\u201d simply by rushing to file suit and then claiming that the lawsuit caused the DOJ to\n\nsubsequently process and release documents. The timing of Eddington\u2019s lawsuit means that the\n\nagency would in any circumstance be producing documents after the suit was filed. Gov\u2019t\n\nAccountability & Oversight v. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, No. 23-cv-3268, 2024 WL 4828107, at *5\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 19, 2024). Eddington has failed to show that the DOJ was doing anything but\n\nproceeding business as usual on his FOIA request before he filed suit. Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe\n\nof Indians v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 750 F.2d 117, 120 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\u201cAbsent any evidence on\n\nthe matter, the natural inference is that the [defendant] was simply responding to the [plaintiff\u2019s]\n\nrequest.\u201d).\n\f Eddington also fails to show that the DOJ suddenly accelerated processing his FOIA\n\nrequest because of his lawsuit. In determining whether an agency would have taken longer to\n\nproduce responsive records absent a lawsuit, the Court may compare the agency\u2019s processing time\n\nfor a specific FOIA request against the agency\u2019s average processing time for similar requests. See,\n\ne.g., Gov\u2019t Accountability & Oversight, 2024 WL 4828107, at *4. Eddington errs, however, in\n\nattempting to make an apples-to-apples comparison between his case and the average processing\n\ntime for 2019 \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests. First, Eddington merely assumes without any support\n\nthat his case qualifies as \u201ccomplex\u201d as the agency defined that term for inclusion of cases in the\n\n2019 report.5 See 2019 FOIA Report at 34 (recording that the NSD had an average processing\n\ntime of approximately 110 days for simple FOIA request versus an average of approximately 418\n\ndays for complex FOIA requests). Second, Eddington does not account for the fact that, even if\n\nhis case did qualify as \u201ccomplex,\u201d the report still presents only an average number, necessarily\n\nmeaning that there were complex cases which were processed faster than the average.\n\nThird, the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report captures the average time the DOJ took to complete\n\nprocessing for a FOIA request, not the time it took to initiate processing. See id. at 5 (defining a\n\nprocessed FOIA request as \u201ca request . . . for which an agency has taken final action in all\n\nrespects\u201d). As Eddington acknowledges, the DOJ did not complete processing for his FOIA\n\nrequest until January 11, 2023, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. ECF Nos. 41; 50 at 5 n.2; 51-\n\n2. The DOJ, therefore, took approximately 1,337 days to process Eddington\u2019s FOIA request.\n\nEddington does not offer any explanation to account for the fact that this 1,377-day processing\n\ntime was actually longer than the 418-day average upon which he relies. Finally, Eddington does\n In the 2019 FOIA Report, the DOJ defines a complex request as \u201ca FOIA request that an\nagency using multi-track processing places in a slower track based on the high volume and/or\ncomplexity of the records requested.\u201d See 2019 FOIA Report at 5.\n\fnot provide any evidence that, absent the Covid-19 pandemic, the DOJ would have completed\n\nprocessing his request much faster than this 418-day average. See Harrington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\n\nHealth & Hum. Servs., No. 20-cv-2671, 2022 WL 17555428, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 9, 2022)\n\n(concluding the plaintiff was ineligible for fees despite the agency completing processing \u201ca few\n\nmonths faster\u201d than the agency\u2019s estimated completion date).\n\nIn sum, Eddington has not shown that the DOJ initially engaged in an unexplained delay\n\nbefore he filed suit or that his lawsuit caused the DOJ to suddenly accelerate processing for his\n\nFOIA request. Eddington does not provide hard evidence that he substantially prevailed in this\n\nlitigation beyond the fact that the DOJ processed his FOIA request and produced documents after\n\nhe filed suit. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, Eddington is not eligible\n\nfor attorneys\u2019 fees. Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d at 97 (citations omitted). Because Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that he is eligible for fees, the Court need not consider whether he is entitled to fees\n\nor if his requested award is reasonable.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nDate: July 23, 2025\n\n___________________________________\n MOXILA A.

Part One of request\n\nsought records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the total number of labor hours worked during that period,\n\nand Part Two demanded records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the hours devoted \u201cto investigations of\n\nany and all matters related to left wing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist\n\nagendas-anarchists like Antifa and other agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Def.\u2019s\n\nMot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 13 [hereinafter Def.\u2019s Mot.], Decl. of Michael G. Seidel, ECF No.\n\n13-1 [hereinafter Seidel Decl.], \u00b6 5, Ex. A. The FBI produced a one-page record in response to the\n\nfirst part of the request, but as to the second advised Plaintiff:\n\nThe FOIA does not require federal agencies to answer inquiries,\n create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions concerning\n queried data. Rather the FOIA requires agencies to provide access\n to reasonably described, nonexempt records. The questions posed\n\f in the referenced letter are not FOIA requests because they do not\n comply with the FOIA and its regulations. Therefore, your request\n is being administratively closed.\n\nId., Ex. F.\n\nDefendant moves for summary judgment. See Def.\u2019s Mot. Plaintiffs do not contest the\n\nagency\u2019s response to Part One of the request. Mem. in Support of Pls.\u2019 Mot. in Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s\n\nMot., ECF No. 19 [hereinafter Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n], at 2 n.1. Their dispute concerns Part Two. At issue is\n\nwhether Plaintiffs properly exhausted administrative remedies as to that portion of the demand,\n\nand whether Defendant conducted an adequate search for records. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 8\u201310; Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n\n\nat 9\u201311.\n\nThe court finds that Defendant performed an adequate search with respect to Part Two of\n\nthe request. It therefore does not reach the exhaustion issue. See Hidalgo v. FBI, 344 F.3d 1256,\n\n1258 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (stating that \u201cthe exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional because the\n\nFOIA does not unequivocally make it so\u201d). Accordingly, the court will enter judgment in favor of\n\nDefendant.\n\nII.\n\nTo demonstrate it conducted an adequate search, an \u201cagency must show that it made a good\n\nfaith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably\n\nexpected to produce the information requested.\u201d Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 920 F.2d 57,\n\n68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The agency must provide a \u201creasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the\n\nsearch terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain\n\nresponsive materials (if such records exist) were searched.\u201d Id. An agency affidavit is accorded a\n\npresumption of good faith if it is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory, and . . . submitted in\n\ngood faith.\u201d Eddington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 35 F.4th 833, 837 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting\n\fSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). That presumption cannot be\n\novercome with \u201cpurely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of [the request].\u201d\n\nId. (quoting SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200) (alteration in original). The plaintiff must provide\n\n\u201c\u2018countervailing evidence\u2019 as to the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\u201d Iturralde v. Comptroller of\n\nthe Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted). \u201cIf a review of the\n\nrecord raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of well defined requests and positive\n\nindications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is inappropriate.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nIn this case, Defendant\u2019s declaration from Michael Seidel is entitled to a presumption of\n\ngood faith. It is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory\u201d and explains why the FBI produced no\n\nrecords in response to Part Two of the request. See Eddington, 35 F.4th at 837; Seidel Decl.,\n\nSeidel is the Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the FBI.\n\nSeidel Decl. \u00b6 1. He states that, to identify responsive information, the agency turned to the\n\nPerformance Management Unit (PMU), Resources Planning Office, in the Office of the Associate\n\nDeputy Director. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 23. Seidel explains:\n\nPMU is responsible for organizing and making management data\n accessible to the FBI to impact decisions on program management,\n resource allocation and organizational planning. PMU structures\n and arranges information related to various aspects of the FBI\n operations and resources, and ensures that crucial data is readily\n available and easily retrievable when needed.\n\nId. PMU advised that its ability to report validated hours for specific cases assigned to the\n\nWashington Field Office was \u201climited.\u201d Id. \u00b6 26. FBI agents record hours worked on cases and\n\nassociate certain classification codes, but \u201cthere is no tracking mechanism for distinguishing cases\n\nrelated to specific events.\u201d Id. There is no classification code associated with matters such as \u201cleft\n\nwing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist agendas-anarchists like Antifa and\n\nother agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Id. To fulfill Part Two of the request, the\n\fFBI \u201cwould be required to answer inquiries, create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions\n\nconcerning queried data which are not required under FOIA.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27. The FBI \u201cdoes not\n\nmaintain the specific data sought by Plaintiffs\u201d in Part Two of their request. Id. \u00b6 32.\n\nPlaintiffs submit two critiques of the search. First, grasping on to the word \u201climited,\u201d which\n\nPMU used to describe its capacity to retrieve labor hours data about specific events, Plaintiffs\n\nassert that the declaration lacks sufficient specificity to establish that responsive data does not\n\nexist. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10. But that contention overlooks Seidel\u2019s explanation that \u201cto fulfill\n\nPlaintiffs[\u2019] request\u201d the agency would have to sift through the available data, analyze it, drawn\n\ninferences from it, and create a new record. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 27. The declaration leaves no room for\n\ndoubt that data responsive to Part Two does not independently exist.\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs fault the agency for not inquiring into whether the data sought \u201cmay have\n\nalready been compiled\u201d in some other form. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. As Plaintiffs put it: \u201c[T]he FBI\n\nappears to only have searched for source data to produce \u2018records sufficient to show\u2019; it appears\n\nthey did not search for compilations of that data that answer the same question.\u201d Id. at 11.\n\nBut Plaintiffs offer no \u201ccountervailing evidence\u201d to believe that such a compilation exists. They\n\ndo not assert that the FBI \u201cfailed to search particular offices or files where the document might\n\nwell have been found.\u201d Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315. They do not contend that the agency \u201cfailed\n\nor refused to interview government officials for whom there was strong evidence that they might\n\nhave been helpful in finding the missing documents.\u201d Id. And Plaintiffs point to no \u201cevidence\n\nthat would indicate that at the time the Department searched its files there was reason to believe\u201d\n\nthat a responsive compilation of data was contained in the files. Id.; see Eddington, 35 F.4th at\n\n838 (describing Iturralde as \u201clisting ways government affidavit or declaration could be\n\ninadequate\u201d).\n\f In the end, Plaintiffs merely speculate that a report or some other record exists that contains\n\nthe highly specific information that they seek: verified labor hours spent by (1) a particular FBI\n\nfield office (2) during a defined three-month period (3) on investigations into left-wing domestic\n\nterrorist groups like Antifa and \u201cother agitators\u201d that (4) arose out of \u201cthe summer 2020 riots.\u201d\n\nSee Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. Plaintiffs\u2019 supposition that such a data compilation might exist is not\n\nenough to raise substantial doubt about the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court grants Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nECF No. 13. A final, appealable order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nDated: July 23, 2025 Amit P. Mehta\n United States District Judge\n\n5"

For the following reasons, we grant Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s writ application for the limited purpose of ordering the trial court to\n\nconsider Ms. Toussaint\u2019s \u201cNotice of Intent to File Supervisory Writ (\u201cNotice of\n\nIntent\u201d) as a timely motion for appeal.\n\nRELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL\n HISTORY\n\nOn October 3, 2022, Nichele1 Spears died during a colonoscopy screening.\n\nOn June 1, 2023, her husband, Sean Toussaint, filed a request for the appointment\n\nof a medical review panel. The medical review panel rendered an opinion on July\n\n18, 2024, therein finding that a nurse and doctor breached the applicable standard\n\nof care during Nichele Spears\u2019 procedure. Shortly thereafter, on September 3,\n\n2024, Sean Toussaint also died. On October 15, 2024, the Orleans Parish Civil\n\nDistrict Court appointed Ms. Toussaint, the sister of Sean Toussaint, as the\n\nadministratrix of his succession. Only one week later, on October 22, 2024, Rhyan\n\n1 The name \u201cNicole\u201d also appears in Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application; but this Opinion\n\nwill use the name \u201cNichele\u201d because that is the name listed in the medical review panel opinion\nand the Petition for Damages, both of which are discussed later.\n\fSpears, who is the son of Nichele Spears, filed a Petition for Damages in Orleans\n\nParish Civil District Court against the nurse and doctor regarding his mother\u2019s\n\ndeath.\n\nSubsequently, on April 15, 2025, Ms. Toussaint filed her Motion to\n\nIntervene, whereby she contended she had an interest in intervening in Rhyan\n\nSpears\u2019 lawsuit pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091 because she had been appointed\n\nadministratix of Sean Toussaint\u2019s succession; was a surviving heir of Sean\n\nToussaint; and sought the same or similar relief as Rhyan Spears.2 As Ms.\n\nToussaint explained in her Motion to Intervene, prior to his death, Sean Toussaint\n\nhad initiated a wrongful death and survival action against the defendants named in\n\nRhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit. Ms. Toussaint asserted that as the administratrix of Sean\n\nToussaint\u2019s estate, she therefore had \u201cthe right and responsibility to sue on behalf\n\nof [the] estate to recover assets owed to it, defend against claims, and ensure the\n\nestate interests [were] protected in the succession process\u201d pursuant to La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 3196.3 Rhyan Spears, the defendant nurse, and the State of Louisiana on behalf\n\nof the defendant doctor each filed an opposition to Ms. Toussaint\u2019s Motion to\n\nIntervene and asked the trial court to dismiss it.\n\nOn June 12, 2025, the trial court conducted a hearing on Ms. Toussaint\u2019s\n\nMotion to Intervene. In a judgment dated June 17, 2025, the trial court denied Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s Motion to Intervene and dismissed it with prejudice. On July 7, 2025,\n\nMs. Toussaint filed her Notice of Intent. Therein, she specified that she was\n\n2 Regarding the ability to intervene, La. C.C.P. art. 1091 states that \u201c[a] third person\n\nhaving an interest therein may intervene in a pending action to enforce a right related to or\nconnected with the object of the pending action against one or more of the parties thereto.\u201d\nAccording to La. C.C.P. art. 1031, an intervention is an incidental demand.\n 3 Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 3196 provides that \u201cIn the performance of\n\nhis [or her] duties, a succession representative may exercise all procedural rights available to a\nlitigant.\u201d\n\fseeking review of the June 17, 2025 judgment and requested that the trial court\n\nstay the proceedings in Rhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit pending this Court\u2019s decision. On\n\nJuly 9, 2025, the trial court signed the order permitting Ms. Toussaint to seek\n\nsupervisory review but denied Ms. Toussaint\u2019s request for a stay of the\n\nproceedings. This Court received Ms. Toussaint\u2019s timely writ application on July\n\n16, 2025.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\nIn her writ application, Ms. Toussaint asserts two assignments of error:\n\n1. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that filing of a\n request for a Medical Review Panel under La. R.S. 40:1231.8\n does not constitute the legal initiation of a medical malpractice\n claim.\n\n2. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that an appointed\n administrator of a deceased claimant\u2019s estate did not have legal\n authority to continue a pending medical malpractice action\n initially filed by the decedent.\n\nIn our review of Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application, we realized a procedural issue\n\nthat must be addressed before this Court can consider the merits of these above\n\narguments.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIssue One: Whether a Writ Application was the Proper Procedural Vehicle for\nSeeking Review of the Trial Court\u2019s Judgment\n\nBy filing a writ application regarding the trial court\u2019s June 17, 2025\n\njudgment dismissing her Motion to Intervene, Ms. Toussaint sought to invoke this\n\nCourt\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction rather than our appellate jurisdiction. This Court\n\n\u201chas appellate jurisdiction of . . . all civil matters\u201d and \u201chas supervisory jurisdiction\n\nover cases which arise within its circuit.\u201d La. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 10. \u201cThis [C]ourt\u2019s\n\fappellate jurisdiction extends to final judgments identified as such by appropriate\n\nlanguage and to interlocutory judgments when expressly provided by law.\u201d First\n\nNBC Bank v. River Park Dev., L.L.C., 2021-1209, p. 3 (La. App. 1 Cir. 4/8/22),\n\n341 So.3d 827, 829 (first citing La. C.C.P. arts. 1918 and 2083; and then citing\n\nBarfield v. Tammany Holding Co., 2016-1420 (La. App. 1 Cir. 6/2/17), 2017 WL\n\n2399020, *1). We begin our discussion with the question of whether a writ\n\napplication\u2014rather than an appeal\u2014was the proper procedural vehicle for Ms.\n\nToussaint to seek review of the judgment. To resolve this issue, we must determine\n\nif the trial court\u2019s judgment was appealable. If so, an appeal was the proper method\n\nfor seeking review instead of a writ application.\n\nWe find the relevant codal articles and jurisprudence interpreting them\n\nsupport a finding that a judgment dismissing a request to intervene is an appealable\n\njudgment. Defining the types of judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1841 states that a final\n\njudgment is one \u201cthat determines the merits in whole or in part.\u201d According to La.\n\nC.C.P. art. 2083, \u201c[a] final judgment is appealable in all causes in which appeals\n\nare given by law, whether rendered after hearing, by default, or by reformation\n\nunder [La. C.C.P. art.] 1814.\u201d Regarding final judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1915\n\nspecifies that a final judgment can be a partial one. That is,\n\nA. A final judgment may be rendered and signed by the court,\n even though it may not grant the successful party or parties all of the\n relief prayed for, or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case,\n when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to less than all of the parties,\n defendants, third party plaintiffs, third party defendants, or\n intervenors.\n\nLa. C.C.P. art. 1915 (A)(1). In interpreting La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) in Simmons\n\nv. Chambliss, the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal (\u201cSecond Circuit\u201d)\n\freviewed the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining exceptions of no right of action and\n\nno cause of action and dismissing the claims in intervention asserted by Anthony J.\n\nBruscato (\u201cMr. Bruscato\u201d). 37,461, p. 2 (La. App. 2 Cir. 8/20/03), 852 So.2d 1237,\n\n1238. Prior to considering the merits of the appeal, the Second Circuit ruled the\n\nappeal could proceed because the judgment was a final judgment as to Mr.\n\nBruscato under La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) since he had been dismissed from the\n\naction and was no longer a party thereto. Id. at p. 2, 852 So.2d at 1239.\n\nAdditionally, in Servi-Clean Industries, Inc. v. Tonti Management Corp., the\n\nLouisiana Supreme Court explained that a judgment dismissing an intervention is a\n\n\u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the contemplation of La. C.C.P. art. 1841 as it is a\n\ndetermination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding. 336 So.2d 799,\n\n805 (La. 1976).\n\nMoreover, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal has specifically held\n\nthat when a trial court denies a petition to intervene, this constitutes an appealable\n\njudgment. First NBC Bank, 2021-1209, p. 3, 341 So.3d at 829 (citations omitted).\n\nFurther, this Court has reviewed a trial court\u2019s judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene under its appellate jurisdiction. See generally Roy Anderson Corp. v. 225\n\nBaronne Complex, L.L.C., 2022-0784 (La. App. 4 Cir. 4/11/23), 360 So.3d 144;\n\nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 455 So.2d 1260 (La. App.\n\n4th Cir. 1984). In light of the foregoing, we find a judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene is an appealable judgment. Thus, an appeal was the proper method for\n\nMs. Toussaint to seek review of the trial court\u2019s judgment denying her Motion to\n\nIntervene, not an application for supervisory writ.\n\fIssue Two: How to Proceed with a Writ Application Seeking Review of an\nAppealable Judgment\n\nNext, we must consider how to proceed in light of our above holding that the\n\ntrial court\u2019s judgment was an appealable judgment for which Ms. Toussaint should\n\nhave filed an appeal rather than a writ application. In In re Howard, the Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court considered a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a writ application with the\n\nLouisiana Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal rather than an appeal regarding the\n\nunderlying appealable judgment. 541 So.2d 195 (La. 1989). The Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court explained the plaintiff made a mistake by seeking review of the\n\njudgment by supervisory writs rather than appeal. Id., 541 So.2d at 197. Noting,\n\nhowever, that the plaintiff filed her motion and order with the trial court within the\n\ndelay for taking a devolutive appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the\n\nmatter to the trial court with instructions to treat the plaintiff\u2019s notice of intent as a\n\nmotion for appeal and to grant the plaintiff an appeal from the judgment. Id.\n\nLike the plaintiff in In re Howard, Ms. Toussaint made a mistake when she\n\nsought review of the June 17, 2025 judgment by supervisory writs rather than by\n\nappeal because the judgment was appealable. Nevertheless, Ms. Toussaint filed her\n\nNotice of Intent and associated order well within the delays for taking an appeal.\n\nLa. C.C.P. arts. 2087, 2121, 2123. Accordingly, and because \u201c[e]very pleading\n\nshall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\u201d we find the same approach\n\nutilized by the Louisiana Supreme Court in In re Howard is proper here. La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 865. Though Ms. Toussaint erroneously titled her pleading \u201cNotice of Intent to\n\nFile Supervisory Writ,\u201d the trial court should have disregarded the erroneous title,\n\ntreated the pleading as a timely motion for appeal, and granted the appropriate\n\norder. In the interest of justice, and because Ms. Toussaint was entitled to an\n\fappeal of the June 17, 2025 final judgment upon the timely filing of a pleading\n\nseeking review of that judgment, we remand the matter to the trial court to treat\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s July 7, 2025 pleading seeking review of the June 17, 2025\n\njudgment as a timely motion for appeal. In light of this, we pretermit discussion of\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s assignments of error.\n\nDECREE\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we grant Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application for the\n\nlimited purpose of remanding this matter to the trial court with instructions to grant\n\nMs. Toussaint an appeal from the June 17, 2025 judgment.\n\nWRIT GRANTED; REMANDED\n\n7"

FISCHER, J., concurred in\njudgment only.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nPer Curiam.\n {\u00b6 1} This is an election case concerning respondent Franklin County Board\nof Elections\u2019 certification of respondent Holly Stein\u2019s name for placement on the\nNovember 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a candidate for the Ward 4 seat on the\nWhitehall City Council. Relators, Lori Elmore and the City of Whitehall, contend\nthat the board erred in certifying Stein\u2019s name because, they say, she does not meet\nthe two-year residency requirement found in Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\nAs relief, relators request a writ of prohibition to prevent the board from placing\nStein\u2019s name on the ballot. We grant the writ.\n I. BACKGROUND\n {\u00b6 2} Whitehall is a municipal corporation located within Franklin County\nand is governed by a charter. Section 3(a) of the charter provides that \u201cCouncil\nmembers for wards shall have resided in their respective wards and Council\nmembers at large shall have resided in the City for at least two years next preceding\ntheir election.\u201d Whitehall Charter, \u00a7 3(a).\n {\u00b6 3} In January 2025, Stein filed with the board a declaration of candidacy\nand a petition seeking nomination to represent Ward 4 on the Whitehall City\nCouncil. The board later certified Stein\u2019s name for placement on the November 4,\n2025 general-election ballot. Elmore currently serves as an at-large member of the\nWhitehall City Council and is a qualified Whitehall elector.\n {\u00b6 4} In February 2025, Elmore filed a protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy,\nand the board held a hearing on Elmore\u2019s protest in March. At the hearing, Elmore\ncontended that the board should disqualify Stein from the ballot because she did\nnot meet Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year residency requirement. Elmore interpreted\nSection 3(a) as requiring ward candidates to have lived in their respective wards for\nthe two years prior to the election at issue, meaning that for purposes of the\nNovember 4, 2025 general election, Stein must have lived in Ward 4 since\nNovember 4, 2023. In support of her claim that Stein did not meet this requirement,\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nElmore pointed to, among other things, Stein\u2019s voting records. Elmore deduced\nfrom these records that Stein resided in Licking County\u2014and thus outside Ward 4\nand Whitehall\u2014throughout 2023.\n {\u00b6 5} Stein appeared at the protest hearing, admitted that she lived in\nLicking County throughout 2023, and argued that she should nonetheless remain a\nWard 4 candidate for the Whitehall City Council. Stein maintained that under this\ncourt\u2019s decision in State ex rel. Rocco v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2017-\nOhio-4466, the Whitehall Charter required only that she have resided in Ward 4 for\nany two-year period preceding the election. Because she lived in Ward 4 from 2019\nuntil 2022, she asserted, her candidacy complied with Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year\nresidency requirement. Alternatively, based on principles of grammar, she argued\nthat the requirement applied only to at-large candidates and that ward candidates\nneed only show that they resided in their ward at any preceding time. Stein argued\nthat because she resided in her ward before the November 4, 2025 general election,\nher candidacy complied with Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n {\u00b6 6} At the conclusion of the hearing, the board denied Elmore\u2019s protest.\n {\u00b6 7} Relators then filed this original action seeking a writ of prohibition to\nprevent the board from placing Stein\u2019s name on the ballot or, alternatively, a writ\nof mandamus ordering the board to grant Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s\ncandidacy. We denied relators\u2019 motion to expedite the case. 2025-Ohio-1090.\nAfter respondents each filed a motion to dismiss the action, we granted the motions\nas to relators\u2019 mandamus claim, denied the motions as to the prohibition claim, sua\nsponte ordered respondents to answer the complaint as to the prohibition claim, and\nsua sponte granted an alternative writ of prohibition, scheduling the submission of\nevidence and briefs. 2025-Ohio-1757.\n {\u00b6 8} The case is ripe for our decision on relators\u2019 prohibition claim.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n {\u00b6 9} To be entitled to a writ of prohibition, relators must show that (1) the\nboard has exercised quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power was\nunauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ would result in injury for which no\nadequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of the law. State ex rel. Elder v.\nCamplese, 2015-Ohio-3628, \u00b6 13. This court has observed that after a board of\nelections exercises its quasi-judicial power by denying a protest, relief in\nprohibition is available to prevent the placement of a name or issue on a ballot\nprovided that the election has not yet been held. See, e.g., Tatman v. Fairfield Cty.\nBd. of Elections, 2004-Ohio-3701, \u00b6 14.\n {\u00b6 10} There is no dispute that the board exercised quasi-judicial power by\ndenying Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy. Nor is there a dispute that\nrelators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law due to the\nproximity of the November 4 election. Still more, the parties do not dispute the\nrelevant facts. What remains to be decided, then, is a purely legal question\nconcerning the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n A. Rocco\u2019s dueling opinions and the meaning of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\n {\u00b6 11} Relators argue that under Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter, a\nward candidate for city council must have lived in her respective ward for at least\nthe two years immediately before the election at issue. Because Stein indisputably\ndid not live in Ward 4 during any part of 2023, they maintain, she should not have\nbeen certified for placement on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a\nWard 4 candidate.\n {\u00b6 12} Relators insist that their understanding of Section 3(a) is borne out\nby its plain meaning, thereby obviating the need for interpretation. They correctly\nobserve that when this court construes a city charter, general rules of statutory\ninterpretation apply. See State ex rel. Miller v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections,\n2021-Ohio-831, \u00b6 33. Thus, because the Whitehall Charter conveys an\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nunambiguous meaning, the argument runs, the charter must be applied rather than\ninterpreted. See Pelletier v. Campbell, 2018-Ohio-2121, \u00b6 14. But although\nrelators start their argument with an appeal to plain meaning, they immediately\npivot to parsing Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d against the\nbackdrop of how that phrase was understood by members of this court in Rocco,\n2017-Ohio-4466. In relators\u2019 view, Justice DeWine\u2019s dissenting opinion in that\ncase advanced the correct understanding of the phrase\u2014i.e., that \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as being synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\n {\u00b6 13} For their part, respondents urge us to follow the lead opinion in\nRocco, under which the phrases \u201cnext preceding\u201d and \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as having different meanings. Under respondents\u2019 view of\nSection 3(a), Stein need only have lived in Ward 4 for any two-year period\npreceding the upcoming election, not the period immediately preceding the\nelection. Respondents emphasize that under Section 23(a) of the Whitehall Charter,\nmayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City for three years\nimmediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they seek election.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Respondents maintain that had the charter\u2019s drafters intended\nfor Section 3(a) to mean what relators say it means, then the drafters would have\nused the same language for ward candidates that they used for mayoral candidates.\n {\u00b6 14} Because Rocco looms large in this case, we begin our analysis by\ndiscussing that case. At issue there was whether Andrea Rocco should appear on\nthe ballot as a candidate for the City of Westlake\u2019s law director. The Westlake\nCharter provided that\n\n\u201c[t]he Director of Law shall be a qualified elector at the time of his\n election, shall have been a resident of the City for at least eighteen\n (18) months immediately preceding his election, an attorney at law\n duly admitted to the practice of law before the courts of the State of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nOhio, and been engaged in the active practice of law in Ohio for a\n period of six (6) years next preceding his election.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Rocco at \u00b6 8 (lead opinion), quoting Westlake Charter,\nart. IV, \u00a7 4.\n {\u00b6 15} Multiple protests were brought against Rocco\u2019s candidacy, arguing\nthat because she had not practiced law for the six years immediately preceding the\nupcoming election, her candidacy was defective. The Cuyahoga County Board of\nElections sustained the protests, and Rocco then brought an original action in this\ncourt, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the board to place her name on the\nballot.\n {\u00b6 16} Four separate opinions resulted. Although a majority of the court\nvoted to grant the writ, the majority could not agree on a rationale. The lead\nopinion, authored by former Justice O\u2019Donnell and joined by former Justice French,\ndetermined that the Westlake Charter required only that candidates for law director\nhave been engaged in the active practice of law for any period of six years preceding\nthe election at issue. Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 2. Former Justice O\u2019Neill concurred\nin judgment only and authored an opinion addressing a separate issue that has no\nbearing on this case. See id. at \u00b6 23-24 (O\u2019Neill, J., concurring in judgment only).\nJustice Fischer concurred in judgment only without an opinion. Former Chief\nJustice O\u2019Connor dissented, opining that the charter required law-director\ncandidates to have been engaged in the active practice of law during the six-year\nperiod immediately preceding the election. Id. at \u00b6 35 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting).\nAnd Justice DeWine authored a dissent joined by then-Justice Kennedy, expressing\na view similar to the one advanced by former Chief Justice O\u2019Connor. See id. at\n\u00b6 52 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 17} In support of the court\u2019s judgment granting the writ, the lead opinion\nexplained that whereas the Westlake Charter uses the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d in\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nprescribing the practice-of-law requirement, it uses the phrase \u201cimmediately\npreceding\u201d in prescribing the residency requirement. Reasoning that the difference\nin wording must have been meant to convey a difference in meaning, the lead\nopinion inferred that the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d meant something different from\nthe phrase \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d especially because the two phrases appeared\nin \u201cclose proximity\u201d to each other. Id. at \u00b6 16. As the lead opinion put it, had the\ncharter\u2019s drafters intended to require candidates to have been engaged in the active\npractice of law during the six-year period immediately preceding the election at\nissue, they would have used wording to that effect, \u201c[b]ut they did not do so.\u201d Id.\nThe lead opinion also emphasized that under the charter, candidates had to have\npracticed law for \u201ca period of six (6) years\u201d rather than \u201cthe period of six (6) years.\u201d\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Id. at \u00b6 13, quoting Westlake Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 4.\nBecause \u201ca\u201d is an indefinite article conveying the sense of \u201cany,\u201d the lead opinion\nreasoned, the charter required only that candidates have been engaged in the\npractice of law for any six-year period preceding the election. See id. Last, the\nlead opinion invoked the policy principle that doubts should be resolved in favor of\nthose seeking office to enable the public to have the benefit of choice among all\nqualified persons. Id. at \u00b6 18.\n {\u00b6 18} The dissenters countered that the lead opinion\u2019s approach sapped the\nphrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d of its ordinary meaning. They pointed out that under\nseveral lexical sources, there was no linguistic daylight between \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38\n(DeWine, J., dissenting). As discussed below, they also observed that the Revised\nCode contains numerous instances in which it makes sense to construe \u201cnext\npreceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30-32\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 39-40 (DeWine, J., dissenting). And they also\nsaw a sensible policy reflected in their construction of the charter\u2014namely, that the\nvoters would be better served by a candidate currently engaged in the practice of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nlaw than by one whose practice had lain dormant. Id. at \u00b6 33 (O\u2019Connor, C.J.,\ndissenting); id. at \u00b6 51 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 19} The above discussion of Rocco raises the question whether we\nshould follow the lead opinion\u2019s analysis or the dissenters\u2019.1 A plurality opinion\ndoes not constitute binding authority, but a court may rely on a plurality opinion if\nit finds the opinion to be persuasive. NASCAR Holdings, Inc. v. Testa, 2017-Ohio-\n9118, \u00b6 18. For the reasons explained below, we decline to follow the Rocco lead\nopinion here.\n {\u00b6 20} As noted above, general rules of statutory interpretation apply in\ndiscerning the meaning of a city charter. Miller, 2021-Ohio-831, at \u00b6 33. Foremost\namong these rules is that \u201c\u2018[t]he words of a governing text are of paramount\nconcern, and what they convey, in their context, is what the text means.\u2019 \u201d State v.\nReed, 2020-Ohio-4255, \u00b6 17, quoting Scalia and Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts, 56 (2012). In the absence of a legislative definition\nor technical meaning, it is proper to use dictionaries to discern a word\u2019s plain and\nordinary meaning. See Rancho Cincinnati Rivers, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, 2021-Ohio-2798, \u00b6 21; see also Athens v. McClain, 2020-Ohio-5146, \u00b6 30\n(\u201cIn determining the \u2018common and ordinary meaning\u2019 of words, courts may look to\ndictionaries.\u201d); State v. Wells, 2001-Ohio-3, \u00b6 8 (\u201cTo determine the common,\neveryday meaning of a word, we have consistently used dictionary definitions.\u201d).\n {\u00b6 21} The lead opinion in Rocco strayed from these principles. As the\ndissenters noted, the lead opinion did not even try to discover the plain and ordinary\nmeaning of the words \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d Rocco, 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 27\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 43 (DeWine, J., dissenting). Rather, the lead\nopinion inferred that because the Westlake Charter used the phrases \u201cimmediately\n\n1. Although the Rocco lead opinion was followed in State ex rel. Nasal v. Miami Cty. Bd. of\nElections, 2021-Ohio-2993, \u00b6 10, and State ex rel. Emhoff v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2018-\nOhio-1660, \u00b6 20, Nasal was a plurality decision and Emhoff relied on Rocco\u2019s practice-of-law\nanalysis, which is not an issue in this case.\n\f January Term, 2025\n\npreceding\u201d and \u201cnext preceding\u201d in close proximity to each other, the phrases must\nhave different meanings. Before drawing this inference, however, the lead opinion\nshould have first consulted proper lexical sources to determine the meaning of\n\u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d See Rancho at \u00b6 21. Doing so establishes that \u201cnext\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately\u201d are synonymous, as the dissenters carefully demonstrated.\n {\u00b6 22} One source cited by the dissenters defined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38 (DeWine, J.,\ndissenting), citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002). Another\ndefined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201c[n]earest; closest; immediately following.\u201d (Emphasis in\noriginal.) Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting), citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n(6th Ed. 1990). And a thesaurus identified \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d as synonyms\nof \u201cnearest.\u201d Id., citing Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (4th Ed. 1977). What is\nmore, as Justice DeWine observed, decisions by Ohio courts pointed in the same\ndirection, deeming \u201cnext preceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 41 (DeWine, J., dissenting), citing Cincinnati v. Kirk, 20 Ohio\nApp. 452, 453 (1st Dist. 1925), and Mansfield v. Hunt, 10 Ohio C.D. 567, 569, 1900\nWL 1068 (5th Dist. 1900). The lead opinion failed to furnish any lexical authorities\nor decisions by Ohio courts cutting the other way. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 23} Citing several examples, the dissenters also showed that the Revised\nCode uses \u201cnext preceding\u201d synonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\nConsider two. First, Chief Justice O\u2019Connor cited a statute requiring prior notice\nof public auctions of personal property by either or both of two methods: (1) by\nplacing notice of the sale in a \u201c\u2018newspaper of general circulation in the county\nduring a period of fifteen days next preceding the sale\u2019 \u201d and/or (2) by posting an\nadvertisement in five public places where the sale would take place \u201c\u2018not less than\nfifteen days next preceding the sale.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 30 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting),\nquoting R.C. 2113.41(A). In either event, the property had to be sold \u201c\u2018at a fixed\nprice or for the best price obtainable.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting R.C. 2113.40. As Chief Justice\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nO\u2019Connor observed, under the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnext preceding,\u201d\nnotice of the auction could be provided years in advance. But that outcome would\nplainly frustrate the statute\u2019s goal of ensuring attendance at the auction and\nconcomitantly drive down the auction prices.\n {\u00b6 24} A second example of the Revised Code\u2019s use of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nsynonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d can be found in Justice DeWine\u2019s\nRocco dissent, which cites a statute concerning watershed-district budgets. He\nnoted that the statute\u2019s third paragraph requires certification of an annual budget to\nthe county commissioners and that its fourth paragraph directs the county\ncommissioners to perform specified duties \u201c\u2018[u]pon receipt of the certification\nunder the next preceding paragraph of this section.\u2019 \u201d Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 40\n(DeWine, J., dissenting), quoting R.C. 6105.08. Reading the two paragraphs\ntogether, Justice DeWine explained, \u201c[t]he fourth paragraph makes sense only if\n\u2018the next preceding paragraph\u2019 is the third paragraph, i.e., the immediately\npreceding paragraph.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 25} Unlike the dissents, the lead opinion in Rocco offers no examples\nfrom the Revised Code to support its interpretation of the Westlake Charter\nprovision at issue. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 26} The above discussion establishes that \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d and\n\u201cnext preceding\u201d are synonyms, and it undercuts the view expressed in the Rocco\nlead opinion that the phrases must have different meanings based on the canon\nknown as the presumption of consistent usage. That canon provides that \u201ca material\nvariation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.\u201d (Boldface deleted.) Reading\nLaw at 170. But although this court has invoked the canon in numerous decisions,\nsee, e.g., Metro. Secs. Co. v. Warren State Bank, 117 Ohio St. 69, 76 (1927); Obetz\nv. McClain, 2021-Ohio-1706, \u00b6 21, it is not ironclad. As Justice DeWine pointed\nout, the canon has been frowned on by no less than the late Justice Joseph Story of\nthe United States Supreme Court. Rocco at \u00b6 46 (DeWine, J., dissenting) (noting\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nthe criticism that the canon assumes an unrealistic level of perfection in legal\ndrafting). As with most canons, the presumption of consistent usage makes sense\nwhen applied \u201cpragmatically\u201d but may be overcome \u201cby context.\u201d Reading Law at\n171. For the reasons given in the dissenting opinions of Chief Justice O\u2019Connor\nand Justice DeWine, context should have trumped the presumption in Rocco.\n {\u00b6 27} Applying the logic of the Rocco dissenters here, we conclude that\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter requires that ward candidates for the\nWhitehall City Council have resided in their respective wards for at least the two\nyears immediately preceding the election at issue. The fact that Section 23(a) of\nthe charter specifies that mayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City\nfor three years immediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they\nseek election\u201d does not, as respondents argue, require a different result. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondents\u2019 view is that had the drafters of the charter intended to require\nward candidates to have been residents of their respective wards for a period of time\nimmediately prior to the election, as the charter provides with respect to mayoral\ncandidates, the drafters would have used wording to that effect. But that argument,\nwhich appeals to the presumption of consistent usage, fails for all the reasons\nexplained above. Moreover, unlike in Rocco, (1) the two competing phrases here\nare not in close proximity to each other and (2) Section 3(a) does not place the\nindefinite article \u201ca\u201d directly before the phrase \u201cnext preceding.\u201d Thus, even if we\nconsidered the lead opinion in Rocco persuasive, the difference between the\nstructure of the charter at issue in that case and the structure of the charter at issue\nhere would counsel against reliance on that opinion in this case.\n {\u00b6 28} The fact that we do not apply the presumption of consistent usage in\nthis case does not mean that it may never be invoked in a future case. Rather, as\nthe dissenters in Rocco explained, there will be some cases\u2014like this one\u2014in\nwhich the canon should be set aside. Indeed, because \u201c[n]o canon of interpretation\nis absolute,\u201d the force of a canon in any particular case \u201cmay be overcome by the\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nstrength of differing principles that point in other directions.\u201d (Boldface deleted.)\nReading Law at 59.\n {\u00b6 29} In the end, it is plain to us that the board\u2019s denial of Elmore\u2019s protest\nwas unauthorized by law because it failed to give proper effect to Section 3(a) of\nthe Whitehall Charter. Because Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nmeans \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d we conclude that Stein had to have resided in\nWard 4 for at least the two years immediately preceding the November 4, 2025\ngeneral election. Because Stein does not meet this requirement, she cannot appear\non the general-election ballot.\n B. Determining to whom the two-year residency requirement applies\n {\u00b6 30} Stein alone advances a more ambitious argument as to why we\nshould deny the writ. In her view, the two-year residency requirement of Section\n3(a) of the Whitehall Charter does not apply to her at all; rather, she says that the\nrequirement applies only to candidates running to be at-large members of the city\ncouncil. According to Stein, the requirement does not apply to ward candidates,\nbecause of the \u201cand\u201d that separates the reference to ward candidates from the\nreference to at-large candidates. By this logic, Stein need only have resided in\nWard 4 at some point in time for any period\u2014say, a day\u2014to qualify as a Ward 4\ncandidate. Because the parties do not dispute that Stein has previously resided in\nWard 4, adopting her argument would mean that her name should remain certified\nfor placement on the ballot.\n {\u00b6 31} Although courts use rules of grammar to determine the meaning of\nlegal texts, see Stiner v. Amazon, Inc., 2020-Ohio-4632, \u00b6 14, Stein fails to identify\na grammar principle that we could apply here to help determine whether, as she\nsays, the residency requirement modifies only the clause applicable to at-large\ncandidates. Instructive here is the series-qualifier canon, which provides that\n\u201c[w]hen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or\nverbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nentire series\u201d (boldface deleted), Reading Law at 147. The Reading Law treatise\noffers an illustration of this canon, explaining that the phrase \u201c[i]nstitutions or\nsocieties that are charitable in nature\u201d (italics deleted) should be understood as\nmeaning that \u201cthe institutions as well as the societies must be charitable.\u201d Id. at\n148 (calling this an example of a \u201cpostpositive modifier\u201d because the qualifying\nphrase is \u201cpositioned after\u201d what it modifies). Providing a second illustration, the\ntreatise says that a qualifying phrase should not carry over when a \u201cdeterminer (a,\nthe, some, etc.) [is] repeated before the second element.\u201d (Italics in original.) Id.\nThus, the phrase \u201c[t]he charitable institutions or the societies\u201d (italics deleted)\nshould be understood as meaning \u201cthat the societies need not be charitable\u201d due to\nthe presence of the second \u201cthe.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 32} In this case, Section 3(a)\u2019s constructions are parallel and there is no\ndeterminer before the second element, thus suggesting that the two-year residency\nrequirement applies both to ward candidates and to at-large candidates. We\nrecognize that Section 3(a) arguably does not fit neatly within the canon\u2019s technical\ndefinition, because the constructions at issue here are wordier than the examples in\nthe treatise and are not strictly composed of either all nouns or verbs in a series.\nBut another example, aided by a dose of pragmatism, helps explain why the\nunderlying logic of the canon should nonetheless apply here.\n {\u00b6 33} Suppose a school administrator were to say: \u201cMiddle-school\nstudents scheduled to participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their\nanswers at the microphone in room 101 and elementary-school students scheduled\nto participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their answers at the\nmicrophone in room 102 without the aid of a dictionary.\u201d It makes no sense to\nthink that the middle-school students are permitted to announce their answers by\nreading from a dictionary but that the elementary-school students are not. By\nsimilar logic, it makes no sense to think that Section 3(a) permits interloping ward\ncandidates but forbids interloping at-large candidates. Plainly, both types of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\ncandidates are expected to be responsive to their constituents and attuned to their\ninterests, and the two-year residency requirement promotes that goal.\n {\u00b6 34} In sum, we conclude that the two-year residency requirement of\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter applies both to ward candidates and to at-\nlarge candidates for the Whitehall City Council.\n III. CONCLUSION\n {\u00b6 35} Because Stein\u2019s candidacy does not comply with Section 3(a) of the\nWhitehall Charter, we grant a writ of prohibition preventing the board from placing\nher name on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot.\n Writ granted.\n _________________\n McTigue & Colombo, L.L.C., J.

The Tennessee Department of\nChildren\u2019s Services (\u201cDCS\u201d) filed a petition in the Juvenile Court for Hawkins County\n(\u201cthe Juvenile Court\u201d) seeking to terminate the parental rights of Rikiya P. (\u201cMother\u201d) to\nher minor children Annabelle, Jasmine, and Liam (\u201cthe Children,\u201d collectively), as well as\nthe parental rights of Daniel R. (\u201cFather\u201d) to Liam.1 The Children had been removed from\nMother and Father\u2019s custody because Mother starved and beat Kenna, Father\u2019s daughter\nby another mother.2 Father was aware of the abuse but failed to protect Kenna. The\nJuvenile Court terminated Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of severe\nchild abuse. Mother and Father appeal. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground\nof severe child abuse was proven against Mother and Father by clear and convincing\nevidence. We find further, as did the Juvenile Court, that clear and convincing evidence\nsupports termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as being in the best interest\nof the Children. We affirm.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Juvenile Court Affirmed;\n Case Remanded\n\nD. MICHAEL SWINEY, C.J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J.

Davenport, V, Kingsport, Tennessee, for the appellant, Rikiya P.\n\nEmily C. Morley, Rogersville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Daniel R.3\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter, and Mara L. Cunningham, Assistant\nAttorney General, for the appellee, the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services.\n\nOPINION\n\nBackground\n\nMother is the mother of Annabelle, born May 2013; Jasmine, born June 2014; and\nLiam, born December 2019. Aaron P. is the father of Annabelle and Jasmine. Father is\nthe father of Liam. Father has an older daughter, Kenna, by another mother. At the\ninception of this case, Mother, Father, Aaron P., the Children, and Kenna all lived under\nthe same roof. In May 2021, Kenna, then age sixteen, tried to run away. A neighbor\nstopped Kenna and returned her. Law enforcement later performed a welfare check but\ndid not see Kenna. That night, law enforcement returned. Mother and Father told the\nofficers that Kenna was away visiting a relative. That was false. Law enforcement found\nKenna hiding under a bed. She was bruised, emaciated, and had a shaved head. Afterward,\nthe Children and Kenna were removed into state custody. DCS filed a petition for\ndependency and neglect, but it was never adjudicated.\n\nOn May 25, 2022, DCS filed a petition seeking to terminate Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s\nparental rights to their respective children. Kenna has since reached majority age. DCS\nproceeded against Mother and Father on the ground of severe child abuse. Trial on DCS\u2019s\npetition was on November 29, November 30, and December 1, 2023. We proceed to review\nthe pertinent testimony from trial. Both Mother and Father declined to testify, invoking\ntheir rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nDr. Andrew Steven Wilt (\u201cDr. Wilt\u201d), an expert witness and the doctor who treated\nKenna after her removal, testified by deposition. Kenna suffered from \u201csevere\nmalnutrition.\u201d Kenna\u2019s weight for her age was less than the bottom first percentile, as was\nher body mass index. Dr. Wilt said it was most medically reasonable that Kenna\u2019s\nmalnutrition was not due to anything Kenna had done to herself but was the result of her\nbeing denied enough food. Kenna weighed 83 pounds when she was admitted to the\nhospital. Kenna had shown signs of \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d in which a malnourished\nperson does not properly handle the reintroduction of proper nutrients, which in turn can\n Father\u2019s previous attorney, Gerald T. Eidson, submitted Father\u2019s appellate brief.\n -2-\n\flead to death. In addition to starvation, Kenna showed signs of having been abused\nphysically, including facial bruising; a subconjunctival hemorrhage (a bleed in the white\npart of one\u2019s eye); bruises on her back; and bruises on her scapula. Kenna told Dr. Wilt\nthat Mother had hit her with a broom and a dustpan. Kenna also reported that she had lived\nunder strict rules about eating and drinking. For breakfast, she tended to have pack of\noatmeal. She was allowed to eat ramen or Chef Boyardee for lunch and dinner. Despite\nthese meager offerings, Kenna remained hungry. When the home ran out of oatmeal, she\nwas given a protein drink instead. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s malnourishment was\nsuch that it was likely to cause severe bodily injury or death. In Dr. Wilt\u2019s view, a\nreasonably prudent medical professional who saw Kenna in the condition she was in would\nhave made a referral.\n\nLisa Hawryluk (\u201cHawryluk\u201d), a DCS caseworker, took the stand to testify. Father\ntold Hawryluk that Kenna had done this to them, and he did not want her back in his home.\nMother likewise blamed Kenna. The thrust of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s positions was that\nthe family\u2019s problems were brought about by Kenna\u2019s bad behavior, not their parenting.\nHawryluk said that Kenna, now out of the family home, was glad to drink something\nbesides water and consumed whatever was given to her. On cross-examination, Hawryluk\nacknowledged that the Children appeared clean and did not have any marks visible.\n\nRetired detective Jeff Greer (\u201cGreer\u201d) testified. Greer saw Kenna at Mother\u2019s and\nFather\u2019s home in her malnourished state. Kenna appeared \u201cvery emaciated\u201d to Greer. She\nwas bruised around one eye and her head. According to Greer, the other children did not\nlook emaciated. Father told Greer that Kenna \u201creally didn\u2019t eat,\u201d but admitted they used\nfood as a punishment. Mother, in turn, told Greer that Kenna refused to eat. Corporal\nAnthony Crosby (\u201cCrosby\u201d) of the Hawkins County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified, as well.\nCrosby said that Kenna looked \u201cseverely abused.\u201d She had a black eye and looked like she\nwas \u201cliterally starving to death.\u201d\n\nConstance Cole (\u201cCole\u201d), a former DCS worker, testified next. Cole previously\nworked on the Children\u2019s case. Cole said that the Children were placed in a home together\nwhile Kenna was placed in a separate home. Cole acknowledged that Mother and Father\nhave a parental attachment to the Children but said that it is not of a healthy kind.\nAnnabelle broke down and cried at the first parental visitation. Cole said that she did not\nbelieve this was due to Annabelle missing her parents. In fact, Annabelle said that she was\nscared because \u201cthey beated me.\u201d However, Cole acknowledged that some of the visits\nwent well. Visitation remained supervised. Annabelle and Jasmine told Cole that they\nwere fearful of returning home. Annabelle and Jasmine said that the parents had been mean\nto Kenna. With respect to positive steps taken by Mother and Father, Cole testified that\nthey had housing and jobs. They also underwent parenting classes. All the same, in Cole\u2019s\nview, the Children should be freed for adoption. Cole explained why this was her view:\n -3-\n\f The abuse that Kenna received while in their care. I would be afraid that\n other children would face that same abuse and the older they get they would\n face the same abuse and it was horrific. Every time I met with Kenna she\n was vibrant and I never saw the things that were described to me by the\n Defendants in her. I never saw the attitudes or any of that in her. I saw a\n thriving young lady. I would be fearful for the other children.\n\nSchool counselor Jason Floyd (\u201cFloyd\u201d) testified. Regarding Annabelle and\nJasmine, Floyd said: \u201cOn a couple occasions separately and every now and again they\nwould want to come in together. They would say they are starving us and not giving us\nany food. When I would ask questions to explore that further they wouldn\u2019t say anything\nelse.\u201d Floyd said that Annabelle was very anxious early on, and Jasmine exhibited\ndisruptive behaviors. In addition, Tracy Burke (\u201cBurke\u201d), a CASA volunteer who worked\nwith the Children, testified. Annabelle told Burke that Mother pulled her hair, slapped her\nin the face or legs, and withheld food from her. Even still, Annabelle said that this was\n\u201cnothing like what they had seen done to Kenna.\u201d Annabelle also reported that Father once\npulled a gun on Kenna.\n\nLarissa J., Kenna\u2019s foster mother, testified.4 Kenna came to live with Larissa J. in\nMay 2021. According to Larissa J., Kenna initially looked \u201cvery frail and skinny.\u201d\nKenna\u2019s head was shaved, and she had a lot of bruises. When Kenna came to live with\nLarissa J., she ate regularly. Kenna then weighed between 80 and 90 pounds. Since then,\nshe has risen to around 140 pounds. Larissa J. enrolled Kenna in school. Kenna did not\nhave any high school credits when she was enrolled. Nevertheless, Kenna has since\ngraduated and has a job.\n\nKenna testified next. Kenna, age 19 at trial, is Father\u2019s daughter. Kenna was asked\nto describe a typical day in Mother and Father\u2019s home. According to Kenna, she woke up\n\u201csuper early,\u201d went to the living room to sit all day, and then went to bed. Mother made\nKenna sit on the floor in a certain precise way as a form of punishment. If Kenna failed to\ndo so, Mother hit her or yelled at her. Kenna needed permission to use the restroom.\nOtherwise, an alarm went off signaling that she could go. Kenna had no television or\ncomputer. For breakfast, she had one bowl of plain oatmeal. This was not by Kenna\u2019s\nchoice. For lunch, she was allowed to have canned soup or Chef Boyardee. It was not\nheated; she had to eat it out of the can. Dinner was the same. If Kenna asked for more,\nMother yelled at her. Kenna could drink only water. Meanwhile, cameras monitored\nKenna in the home. Kenna testified that Father threatened her with a gun twice. Kenna\nwas asked if Father ever tried to protect her from Mother. Kenna said that Father did \u201ca\n Larissa J.\u2019s first name is spelled Larisa in some parts of the record.\n -4-\n\fcouple of times,\u201d but he told her it was not for her benefit, but to protect Mother from\ngetting in trouble.\n\nOn cross-examination, Kenna said that her own mother left her when she was a year\nor a year-and-a-half old, and Mother was at one time a mother figure to her. Asked why\nshe did not climb out of her bedroom window to find food, Kenna said that the window\nwas screwed shut. Kenna acknowledged certain correspondence in which she admitted to\nbeing stubborn. Kenna also said that Mother was \u201cjust a typical mom\u201d to Annabelle and\nJasmine.\n\nMike Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), the Children\u2019s DCS case manager, testified. Smith said that\nthe Children are doing well in foster care. Jasmine and Annabelle were two years behind\nin school, based on their prior lack of education. However, they have made significant\nimprovements. Regarding the Children\u2019s attachment to Mother and Father, Smith testified:\n\nQ. Would you be able to tell the Court if you believe there is a secure and\n healthy parental attachment between these children and the parents?\n A. This is a difficult situation. Annabelle and Jasmine both have disclosed\n that they both don\u2019t want to have any contact with their mother. There are\n certainly concerns there. They both have disclosed that they love their father\n and they would like to see their father. I have seen an attachment there in\n those visits. Liam due to his age obviously he recognizes his mother and\n father. He likes seeing them and he is excited to see them. The question I\n have wondered about with the attachment factor with Liam and generally\n when I see a two or three year old at the end of visits whenever there is some\n kind of separation from the visits a child will normally scream, cry, it is\n usually a traumatic experience to separate the child from the visit. We never\n have that issue with Liam. He is happy to go. He is happy to come and\n happy to go. That has always been an odd situation.\n\nSmith testified that while Father was engaged during the visits, Mother tended to\nuse her phone on the couch. Smith acknowledged that Mother and Father paid child\nsupport. Asked if Mother or Father had undergone a mental health intake, Smith said:\n\nThere is some question with that. I have requested documentation. It is not\n to my liking but it is to her credit, [Mother] has sent me a screen shot of a\n piece of paper from her therapist, but as far as ongoing or what is being\n discussed in therapy, I don\u2019t have any knowledge of it. [Father] has reported\n that he is going to Camelot. I haven\u2019t had any verification from that. I think\n it was Camelot and I may be mistaken as far as the provider but he has\n reported that he is receiving therapy. . . .\n -5-\n\fAt a February 2023 visit, Jasmine locked herself in a bathroom crying that Mother abused\nthem. Jasmine threatened to kill herself. She also threatened to stab Mother if she had to\nsee her again. After this incident, Jasmine spent a week in the hospital. Mother\u2019s visits\nwith Annabelle and Jasmine were suspended.\n\nNext at trial, Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s employer testified favorably about Mother and\nFather. In addition, Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., testified favorably about Mother and\nFather, as well. Pamela P. testified, in effect, that Kenna\u2019s bad behavior was the problem\nin the household, not Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parenting. When confronted with photographs\nof Kenna, Pamela P. testified:\n\nQ. You stated that you left in March, 2021, is that correct?\n A. That\u2019s correct.\n Q. Can you look at this picture and see if that is how Kenna looked when you\n left?\n A. Well, she has her pick marks. I was not here for this picture and that\n timing exactly. I have seen her have injuries before from nobody being at\n home.\n THE COURT: She asked you if that is how she looked when you left?\n A. When I last saw her?\n THE COURT: Yes.\n A. No. She was thin and she had pick marks but, no, I didn\u2019t see this.\n THE COURT: Thank you.\n Q. Same thing. Did she look like this when you left? Is that her haircut that\n she had when you left?\n A. No, Ma\u2019am, but it is the haircut she described that she wanted.\n Q. Oh, it is?\n A. Yes.\n Q. Okay, that is what she said she wanted her hair to look like?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. Okay, thank you. Did she have black eyes when you last saw her and is\n that an injury she would have inflicted upon herself?\n A. Twice. One time she had one black eye and the second time she had two\n and no one was there all day. She didn\u2019t expect to see me.\n Q. Did you ask her about her injuries?\n A. Oh, I had an accident and she would go hide in her room.\n Q. Are you aware that both Annabelle and Jasmine have made statements\n that they also had food restrictions in the home of your daughter?\n A. I am not aware but I know better.\n Q. You don\u2019t believe the children are saying that?\n -6-\n\f A. I believe I have broken children that never got the help they wanted and\n they could be coerced in any way.\n Q. You believe these children are being coerced?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. What evidence do you have of them being coerced?\n A. What evidence do I have?\n Q. Yes.\n A. I can\u2019t state because it is evidenced presented through other people.\n Q. You can\u2019t state?\n THE COURT: You can answer her question, Ma\u2019am.\n A. Why do I think so because other people have told me and I know the kids\n are broken and I have been told in the past that they are in fear of everything\n going on and they can be coerced. I know they always had plenty of food.\n\nIn January 2024, the Juvenile Court entered its final order in which it terminated\nMother\u2019s parental rights to the Children and Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. The Juvenile\nCourt found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the ground of severe child abuse had\nbeen proven against both Mother and Father. The Juvenile Court also found that clear and\nconvincing evidence supported termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as\nbeing in the Children\u2019s best interest. The Juvenile Court specifically found Kenna to be a\ncredible witness. The Juvenile Court also credited the testimony of witnesses Hawryluk,\nGreer, Crosby, Larissa J., Cole, Floyd, Burke, and Smith. By contrast, the Juvenile Court\nspecifically found the testimony of Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., in which she blamed\nKenna for the family\u2019s situation, not credible. In its detailed Memorandum Opinion\nincorporated into its termination order, the Juvenile Court found, in relevant part:\n\nOn May 17, 2021, Kenna was 16 years old, and had been living . . .\n with her father, two other adults, and three younger children. When law\n enforcement discovered Kenna under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed they knew\n immediately from her appearance and condition that she needed medical\n attention. Kenna looked emaciated, as if she was \u201cstarving to death.\u201d She\n had bruising on her face and head, and she had a bizarre haircut.\n Kenna was transported by ambulance to Hawkins County Memorial\n Hospital, and then to Johnson City Medical Center, where law enforcement\u2019s\n observations were confirmed. When Kenna arrived at JCMC she appeared\n visibly dirty, malnourished and bruised. Her appearance was described by\n Dr. Wilt as \u201cwasted or cachectic.\u201d Her ribs were visible, and her hips and\n spine were protruding. In addition to the bruising on her face and head, she\n had bruising down her back and on her shoulder blades. Upon admission,\n Kenna was approximately 5\u2019 6\u201d tall, and weighed 83 pounds. Kenna was\n diagnosed as being severely malnourished due to caloric restriction by the\n -7-\n\fcaregivers in her home. Her malnourishment was so severe that her life was\nat risk from refeeding syndrome. Even in the face of Kenna\u2019s wasted\nappearance, and her obvious need for immediate medical care, Respondents\ncould not recall the last time she had seen a doctor and did not seek medical\nhelp.\n Kenna has also consistently recounted her physical and emotional\nabuse at the hands of Respondents: from being beaten by [Mother]; to being\nthreatened with a hand gun by [Father]; to having her sense of femininity\nsheared away by [Aaron P.]. It is evident to the Court that all three\nrespondents actively participated in her systematic starvation, and in her\nextreme isolation. This evidence was uncontested at trial, and the Court finds\nby a preponderance of the evidence that Kenna suffered from abuse and\nneglect.\n\n***\n\nKenna suffered no burns at the hands of Respondents. No evidence\nwas presented at trial that Kenna suffered any broken bones, or a concussion.\nThe Court does find, however, that being struck in the head by [Mother] with\nher fists and a broom was likely to cause a broken nose or concussion. No\nevidence was introduced that the child suffered subdural bleeding, cerebral\nedema, or a brain contusion. Upon her admission to JCMC, Kenna did have\na subconjunctival hemorrhage. Kenna did have deeply disturbing bruising\non her face and head, and along her spinal column and across her shoulders.\nWhile Kenna was defeminized by her forced haircut, it did not result in\npermanent or protracted disfigurement. Kenna did report that [Mother] had\nhit her with a broom, a bowl, and a belt. Still, Kenna\u2019s wasted condition does\nnot quite fit squarely within any of the abhorrent injuries specifically detailed\nin the statutory definition. The Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d\nelement, however, does not end there.\n While the statutory definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d includes\nspecific examples, it is \u201cnot limited to\u201d those listed examples. Our Supreme\nCourt has held that the words \u201cincludes, but not limited to\u201d are terms of\nenlargement, not terms of restriction. See Lovlace v Copley, 418 S.W.3d 1,\n18 (Tenn. 2013). This language allows a court to employ its aforementioned\ncommon sense to determine whether an injury suffered by a child can\nreasonably be defined as a serious bodily injury. As such, the Court finds\nthat any reasonable person would conclude that a child who is so severely\nmalnourished that she requires hospitalization and medically monitored\nnourishment, has sustained a serious bodily injury. Accordingly, the Court\n\n-8-\n\ffinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the abuse and neglect suffered\nby Kenna was likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n Likewise, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nabuse and neglect suffered by Kenna was likely to cause death. Kenna\u2019s\nmalnourishment was so severe that she exhibited signs of refeeding\nsyndrome, which poses a severe risk of death. Dr. Wilt testified\nunequivocally that Kenna\u2019s severe malnourishment was likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nPerhaps the most damning evidence of Respondents\u2019 knowing\nexposure of Kenna to severe abuse is the fact that they tried to hide her from\nthe authorities. When a Sheriff\u2019s deputy first responded to the residence for\na welfare check, [Aaron P.] told Kenna to hide under his bed, and told law\nenforcement she was not there. When authorities returned to the residence,\nKenna was again told to hide under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed, and [Mother] and\n[Father] lied about Kenna\u2019s whereabouts. Respondents\u2019 actions clearly\nbetray a consciousness of guilt. They knew that Kenna\u2019s discovery by\nauthorities would reveal the abuse they had inflicted on her. The Court,\ntherefore, finds by clear and convincing evidence that [Father], [Mother], and\n[Aaron P.] each knowingly exposed Kenna to abuse or neglect likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n Furthermore, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n[Father] and [Mother] used force on Kenna likely to cause serious bodily\ninjury or death. As discussed above, [Mother] used her hands and objects,\nsuch as a broom, to strike Kenna in the face and head. This force was likely\nto cause a broken bone or concussion. Additionally, the uncontradicted\nevidence at trial was that [Father] twice threatened Kenna with a gun; on one\noccasion pointing a loaded gun at her forehead and stating, \u201cI want to shoot\nyou.\u201d There is no doubt in the Court\u2019s mind that this behavior constitutes a\nuse of force likely to result in serious bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nThe Court, having addressed the underlying facts and elements of the\nstatutory ground of severe child abuse, must now address the ground itself.\n\u201cOnce these specific underlying facts are established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, the court must step back to look at the combined weight of all\nof those facts, to see if they clearly and convincingly show severe child\nabuse.\u201d Id. at 457 quoting In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 591-592 (Tenn. App.\n\n-9-\n\f2012). The Court finds that the Department has proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] have\ncommitted severe child abuse as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102.\n\n***\n\n[Best Interest]\n\n(A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the\nchild\u2019s critical need for stability and continuity of placement throughout\nthe child\u2019s minority. None of the children are currently in an adoptive\nplacement. The children have also been removed from Respondents\u2019 custody\nfor more than two and a half years. Respondents\u2019 therapeutic visitation has\nnever been increased. In fact, [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was\nsuspended at the time of trial. There has never been a trial home placement,\nor even unsupervised visitation. Considering that Respondents\u2019 case for a\nreturn of custody has not advanced at all in more than two and a half years,\nthe instant termination of their parental rights will free the children for\nadoption and perhaps facilitate a pre-adoptive placement. This factor weighs\nin favor of the termination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is\nlikely to have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical\ncondition. A return of Jasmine and Annabelle to the custody of [Mother]\nand/or [Aaron P.] would have a negative effect on their emotional and\npsychological condition. Both girls were present in the home when Kenna\nwas being severely abused. Jasmine witnessed her mother pulling Kenna\u2019s\nhair, and Kenna screaming. She witnessed her mother yelling at Kenna to sit\ncorrectly. Annabelle also witnessed the severe abuse of Kenna. She\ndescribed scary events, and recounted her own maltreatment. At the prospect\nof a visit with her parents, Jasmine threatened to hurt herself and her mother,\nresulting in her admission to Woodridge Psychiatric Hospital. Annabelle did\nnot want to visit with her parents, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic\nstress disorder. All of these facts were uncontradicted by [Mother] and\n[Aaron P.] at trial. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the termination\nof [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n There was no evidence presented at trial regarding Liam\u2019s emotional,\npsychological, or medical condition, likely due to his young age. The Court\nis unable to make a factual finding regarding what effect a change of\ncaretakers would have on Liam. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\nagainst the termination of [Father\u2019s] or [Mother\u2019s] parental rights to Liam.\n\n-10-\n\f (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability\nin meeting the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety\nneeds. Respondents have not had a meaningful opportunity to meet these\nneeds in more than two and a half years. Of course, the children\u2019s removal\nwas the result of Respondents\u2019 own actions. The evidence is undisputed that\nat the time of their removal, the children subject to this petition appeared\nwell. They did not appear malnourished; they were not bruised like Kenna.\nThe evidence is also undisputed that prior to their removal they were\nallegedly being home schooled with a curriculum not accredited in\nTennessee, and that they were educationally behind. It is equally undisputed\nthat when in Respondents\u2019 custody, the children lived in a home of casual\nviolence and abuse. A home in which adults assault, threaten and abuse one\nchild does not meet the safety needs of any child. This factor weighs in favor\nof termination of all Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy\nparental attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable\nexpectation that the parent can create such attachment. As already\ndiscussed, the evidence presented at trial clearly establishes that neither\n[Mother] nor [Aaron P.] have a secure and healthy parental attachment with\nJasmine or Annabelle. Moreover, neither [Mother] nor [Aaron P.] testified\nregarding their attachment with, or love for, their children, or how they\nexpect to recreate that relationship. There was simply no evidence\nintroduced at trial that would allow the Court to conclude that there is a\nreasonable expectation that [Mother] or [Aaron P.] can create a healthy\nparental attachment with Annabelle or Jasmine. The undisputed evidence\nsuggests the opposite.\n At the time of trial, Liam was nearly four years old. He has been\nremoved from his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s custody for significantly more than\nhalf his young life. Again, neither [Father] nor [Mother] elected to testify\nregarding their parental attachment with or love for Liam, or how they hope\nto create such attachment. This factor weighs in favor of the termination of\nall Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other\ncontact with the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate\na positive relationship with the child. The evidence at trial establishes that,\nwhen available, Respondents regularly attended therapeutic visitation with\nthe children, and that Respondents behavior during the visits was largely\nappropriate. [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was suspended in 2023,\nthough the suspension does not appear to have resulted from their behavior\nat the visit. As of trial, [Father] was still attending visits with Liam.\n\n-11-\n\f With regard to [Mother] and [Aaron P.], this factor weighs neither in\nfavor of nor against termination. With regard to [Father], this factor weighs\nagainst termination.\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home. The\nevidence presented at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and\nAnnabelle are fearful of their parents. Jasmine was so fearful of a visit that\nshe credibly threated [sic] to hurt herself and her mother, requiring her\nadmission to a psychiatric hospital. Annabelle has consistently maintained\nthat she does not want to see her parents, and she has been diagnosed with\npost-traumatic stress disorder. While [Father] is not the father of Jasmine or\nAnnabelle, the Court has no doubt their fear also extends to him. There was\nno evidence introduced at trial that Liam was in fear of his parents.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s\nhousehold trigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or\npost-traumatic symptoms. Much as in the previous factor, the evidence\nintroduced at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and Annabelle are\nterrified of all Respondents. There is simply no question that Respondents\ntrigger and exacerbate the girls\u2019 experience of trauma and post-traumatic\nsymptoms. The Court does not have to speculate, as there is undisputed\nevidence of this actually happening. Again, there was no evidence presented\nat trial that would allow the Court to make this same conclusion with regard\nto Liam.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment\nwith another person or persons in the absence of the parent. The children\nare not in a pre-adoptive home. There was no evidence introduced at trial\nthat the children had developed a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson who is still involved in their care in the absence of the parent. The\nchildren had become attached with their initial foster parent who had hoped\nto adopt them, but due to the development of a serious illness was no longer\nable to care for them. Still, the children do not have a healthy attachment\nwith Respondents. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor against\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n\n-12-\n\f (I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships\nwith persons other than parents and caregivers, including biological or\nfoster siblings, and the likely impact of various available outcomes on\nthese relationships and the child\u2019s access to information about the\nchild\u2019s heritage. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle have been placed together\nsince their removal from Respondents more than two and a half years ago.\nThere is direct evidence that Jasmine and Annabelle rely on their relationship\nfor comfort and safety. Their school counsellor, Mr. Floyd, testified that the\nchildren would want to meet with him together. Annabelle scolds her CAC\ninterviewer that she and Jasmine could have been interviewed together. It is\nevident to the Court that this sibling relationship is paramount, and is\nessential to the best interest of all three children. Indeed, their relationship\nwith each other has been the only constant in their lives. This factor weighs\nheavily in favor of the Court\u2019s decision being uniform for all three children.\n (J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and\nbeneficial for the child to be in the home of the parent, including\nconsideration of whether there is criminal activity in the home or by the\nparent, or the use of alcohol, controlled substances, or controlled\nsubstance analogues which may render the parent unable to consistently\ncare for the child in a safe and stable manner. No evidence was presented\nthat Respondents had issues with substance abuse. There was testimony that\nRespondents had largely completed the actions steps set forth for them by\nthe Department. There was some dispute as to whether Respondents had\ncompleted a mental health assessment. Of course, Respondents could have\naddressed this question had they elected to testify. They could have also\nintroduced confirming documentation. They did neither. More importantly,\nRespondents did not testify that they had made a lasting adjustment regarding\ntheir abusive conduct, or even deny that such conduct ever happened. There\nis simply no evidence that allows the Court to conclude, in the face of\nundisputed evidence that Respondents severely abused Kenna, that the\nchildren would be safe in their parents\u2019 home. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available\nprograms, services, or community resources to assist in making a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions. The Court\u2019s\nassessment of this factor mirrors that of factor (J). While Respondents\nlargely completed the action steps set forth by the Department, no\ndocumentary evidence was submitted as an exhibit, and there was no\ntestimony that Respondents have made a lasting adjustment to their abusive\nconduct which resulted in the removal of the children from their custody.\n -13-\n\fThe undisputed testimony at trial was that Respondents refused to accept\nresponsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondent\u2019s parental rights.\n (L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist\nthe parent in making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in\nthe custody of the department. The Court cannot conclude from the\nevidence presented at trial that the Department made reasonable efforts to\nassist Respondents in making a lasting adjustment that would allow the return\nof the children. This factor weighs against termination of Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nestablishing paternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or\naddressing the circumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award\nof custody unsafe and not in the child\u2019s best interest. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nregaining custody of the children, or in addressing the undisputed abuse of\nKenna which led to the removal of the children in the first place.\nRespondents did not testify regarding any steps they had taken to regain\ncustody of the children. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\nRespondents refused to accept responsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This\nfactor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or\nfrequenting the home of the parent, has shown brutality or physical,\nsexual, emotional, or psychological abuse or neglect toward the child or\nany other child or adult. This Court has found by clear and convincing\nevidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] severely abused\nKenna. This factor weighs heavily in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for\nthe child or any other child. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle resided in a\nhome in which Respondents were severely abusing another child. Jasmine\nand Annabelle were twice removed from the custody of [Mother] and [Aaron\nP.] before their current removal. The Court simply cannot find that the\nchildren were ever provided safe and stable care by Respondents. This factor\nweighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the child to thrive. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the children to thrive. The undisputed\nevidence is that Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was\n\n-14-\n\f occurring, which has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n This factor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s\n basic and specific needs and in which the child can thrive. No evidence\n was presented at trial that Respondents demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating a home that meets the children\u2019s basic and specific\n needs and in which the children can thrive. The undisputed evidence is that\n Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was occurring, which\n has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs\n in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is\n healthy and safe for the child. There was no testimony or other evidence\n introduced at trial regarding the physical environment of any of\n Respondents\u2019 current homes. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\n against termination.\n (S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token\n financial support for the child. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\n Respondents paid their child support. The amount of support was not\n identified. This factor weighs against termination.\n (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would\n be detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n The Court has found by clear and convincing evidence that each of [Father],\n [Mother], and [Aaron P.] committed severe child abuse against Kenna. The\n undisputed evidence supports this finding. Respondents did not deny the\n abuse; they did not accept responsibility for their conduct. They did not\n address how things have changed. They did not address the trauma suffered\n by Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs heavily in favor of\n terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n This Court acknowledges, and truly believes, that not all parental\n misconduct is irredeemable. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 877 (Tenn.\n App. 2005). But knowing full well what is at stake, Respondents declined to\n dispute the overwhelming evidence that they severely abused a child;\n declined to accept any responsibility for Kenna\u2019s wasted condition and the\n trauma suffered by Annabelle and Jasmine; and declined to tell the Court\n what steps they have taken to redeem themselves. This Court has no choice\n but to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that the termination of\n Respondents\u2019 parental rights is in the best interest of the children.\n\n(Footnote omitted). Mother and Father timely appealed to this Court.\n -15-\n\f Discussion\n\nWe restate and consolidate Mother\u2019s issues into the following dispositive issues: 1)\nwhether the Juvenile Court erred in finding the ground of severe child abuse against Mother\nand 2) whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of Mother\u2019s parental\nrights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. Father does not challenge the ground for\ntermination found against him but raises an issue as to Liam\u2019s best interest.\n\nAs our Supreme Court has instructed regarding the standard of review in parental\nrights termination cases:\n\nA parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of her child is among the\n oldest of the judicially recognized fundamental liberty interests protected by\n the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.5 Troxel v.\n Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); Stanley\n v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); In re\n Angela E., 303 S.W.3d 240, 250 (Tenn. 2010); In re Adoption of Female\n Child, 896 S.W.2d 546, 547-48 (Tenn. 1995); Hawk v. Hawk, 855 S.W.2d\n 573, 578-79 (Tenn. 1993). But parental rights, although fundamental and\n constitutionally protected, are not absolute. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 250. \u201c\u2018[T]he [S]tate as parens patriae has a special duty to protect minors .\n . . .\u2019 Tennessee law, thus, upholds the [S]tate\u2019s authority as parens patriae\n when interference with parenting is necessary to prevent serious harm to a\n child.\u201d Hawk, 855 S.W.2d at 580 (quoting In re Hamilton, 657 S.W.2d 425,\n 429 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983)); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747,\n 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 250.\n \u201cWhen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks\n not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388. \u201cFew consequences of judicial\n action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u201d Id. at 787, 102\n S.Ct. 1388; see also M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136\n L.Ed.2d 473 (1996). The parental rights at stake are \u201cfar more precious than\n any property right.\u201d Santosky, 455 U.S. at 758-59, 102 S.Ct. 1388.\n Termination of parental rights has the legal effect of reducing the parent to\n the role of a complete stranger and of \u201csevering forever all legal rights and\n U.S. Const. amend. XIV \u00a7 1 (\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without\ndue process of law . . . .\u201d). Similarly, article 1, section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution states \u201c[t]hat no\nman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled,\nor in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers or\nthe law of the land.\u201d\n -16-\n\f obligations of the parent or guardian of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-\n 113(l)(1); see also Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388 (recognizing\n that a decision terminating parental rights is \u201cfinal and irrevocable\u201d). In light\n of the interests and consequences at stake, parents are constitutionally\n entitled to \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d in termination proceedings.\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 754, 102 S.Ct. 1388; see also Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc.\n Servs. of Durham Cnty., N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d\n 640 (1981) (discussing the due process right of parents to fundamentally fair\n procedures).\n\nAmong the constitutionally mandated \u201cfundamentally fair\n procedures\u201d is a heightened standard of proof \u2013 clear and convincing\n evidence. Santosky, 455 U.S. at 769, 102 S.Ct. 1388. This standard\n minimizes the risk of unnecessary or erroneous governmental interference\n with fundamental parental rights. Id.; In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d 586, 596\n (Tenn. 2010). \u201cClear and convincing evidence enables the fact-finder to\n form a firm belief or conviction regarding the truth of the facts, and\n eliminates any serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of these\n factual findings.\u201d In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596 (citations omitted).\n The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard ensures that the facts are\n established as highly probable, rather than as simply more probable than not.\n In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 861 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); In re M.A.R.,\n 183 S.W.3d 652, 660 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).\n\nTennessee statutes governing parental termination proceedings\n incorporate this constitutionally mandated standard of proof. Tennessee\n Code Annotated section 36-1-113(c) provides:\n\nTermination of parental or guardianship rights must be based\n upon:\n\n(1) A finding by the court by clear and convincing evidence that\n the grounds for termination of parental or guardianship rights\n have been established; and\n (2) That termination of the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s rights is in the\n best interests of the child.\n\nThis statute requires the State to establish by clear and convincing proof that\n at least one of the enumerated statutory grounds6 for termination exists and\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(1)-(13).\n -17-\n\f that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d\n at 250; In re F.R.R., III, 193 S.W.3d 528, 530 (Tenn. 2006); In re Valentine,\n 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). \u201cThe best interests analysis is separate\n from and subsequent to the determination that there is clear and convincing\n evidence of grounds for termination.\u201d In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 254.\n Although several factors relevant to the best interests analysis are statutorily\n enumerated,7 the list is illustrative, not exclusive. The parties are free to offer\n proof of other relevant factors. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 878. The trial\n court must then determine whether the combined weight of the facts\n \u201camount[s] to clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the child\u2019s\n best interest.\u201d In re Kaliyah S., 455 S.W.3d 533, 555 (Tenn. 2015). These\n requirements ensure that each parent receives the constitutionally required\n \u201cindividualized determination that a parent is either unfit or will cause\n substantial harm to his or her child before the fundamental right to the care\n and custody of the child can be taken away.\u201d In re Swanson, 2 S.W.3d 180,\n 188 (Tenn. 1999).\n\nFurthermore, other statutes impose certain requirements upon trial\n courts hearing termination petitions. A trial court must \u201censure that the\n hearing on the petition takes place within six (6) months of the date that the\n petition is filed, unless the court determines an extension is in the best\n interests of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(k). A trial court must\n \u201center an order that makes specific findings of fact and conclusions of law\n within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d Id. This portion of\n the statute requires a trial court to make \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of\n law as to whether clear and convincing evidence establishes the existence of\n each of the grounds asserted for terminating [parental] rights.\u201d In re Angela\n E., 303 S.W.3d at 255. \u201cShould the trial court conclude that clear and\n convincing evidence of ground(s) for termination does exist, then the trial\n court must also make a written finding whether clear and convincing\n evidence establishes that termination of [parental] rights is in the [child\u2019s]\n best interests.\u201d Id. If the trial court\u2019s best interests analysis \u201cis based on\n additional factual findings besides the ones made in conjunction with the\n grounds for termination, the trial court must also include these findings in the\n written order.\u201d Id. Appellate courts \u201cmay not conduct de novo review of the\n termination decision in the absence of such findings.\u201d Id. (citing Adoption\n Place, Inc. v. Doe, 273 S.W.3d 142, 151 & n. 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)).\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i).\n -18-\n\f B. Standards of Appellate Review\n\nAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in\n termination proceedings using the standard of review in Tenn. R. App. P.\n 13(d). In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 246. Under Rule 13(d), appellate courts review factual findings de novo on\n the record and accord these findings a presumption of correctness unless the\n evidence preponderates otherwise. In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In\n re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d 387, 393 (Tenn. 2009); In re Adoption of A.M.H., 215\n S.W.3d 793, 809 (Tenn. 2007). In light of the heightened burden of proof in\n termination proceedings, however, the reviewing court must make its own\n determination as to whether the facts, either as found by the trial court or as\n supported by a preponderance of the evidence, amount to clear and\n convincing evidence of the elements necessary to terminate parental rights.\n In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596-97. The trial court\u2019s ruling that the\n evidence sufficiently supports termination of parental rights is a conclusion\n of law, which appellate courts review de novo with no presumption of\n correctness. In re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d at 393 (quoting In re Adoption of\n A.M.H., 215 S.W.3d at 810). Additionally, all other questions of law in\n parental termination appeals, as in other appeals, are reviewed de novo with\n no presumption of correctness. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 246.\n\nIn re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507, 521-24 (Tenn. 2016) (footnotes in original but\nrenumbered). In conjunction with a best interest determination, clear and convincing\nevidence supporting any single ground will justify a termination order. E.g., In re\nValentine, 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). Although Father does not challenge the\nground for termination found against him, we must review it anyway. In re Carrington H.,\n483 S.W.3d at 511 (\u201c[A]ppellate courts must review a trial court\u2019s findings regarding all\ngrounds for termination and whether termination is in a child\u2019s best interests, even if a\nparent fails to challenge these findings on appeal.\u201d).\n\nWe first address Mother\u2019s issues, beginning with whether the Juvenile Court erred\nin finding the ground of severe child abuse against her. On May 25, 2022, when DCS filed\nits petition, the ground of severe child abuse read as follows:\n\n(g) Initiation of termination of parental or guardianship rights may be based\n upon any of the grounds listed in this subsection (g). The following grounds\n are cumulative and nonexclusive, so that listing conditions, acts or omissions\n in one ground does not prevent them from coming within another ground:\n\n***\n -19-\n\f (4) The parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child\n abuse, as defined in \u00a7 37-1-102, under any prior order of a court or is found\n by the court hearing the petition to terminate parental rights or the petition\n for adoption to have committed severe child abuse against any child[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nAs relevant, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102 provides:\n\n(27) \u201cSevere child abuse\u201d means:\n (A)(i) The knowing exposure of a child to or the knowing failure to protect\n a child from abuse or neglect that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or\n death and the knowing use of force on a child that is likely to cause serious\n bodily injury or death;\n (ii) \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d shall have the same meaning given in \u00a7 39-15-\n 402(c)[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102(b)(27)(A) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022). Regarding\nwhat \u201cknowing\u201d conduct consists of in the context of severe child abuse, our Supreme\nCourt has held:\n\n[F]or severe child abuse, a person\u2019s conduct is considered \u201cknowing,\u201d and a\n person is deemed to \u201cknowingly\u201d act or fail to act, when he actually knows\n of relevant facts, circumstances or information, or when he is either in\n deliberate ignorance of or in reckless disregard of such facts, circumstances,\n or information presented to him. Under this standard, the relevant facts,\n circumstances, or information would alert a reasonable parent to take\n affirmative action to protect the child. For deliberate ignorance, a parent can\n be found to have acted knowingly when he has specific reason to know the\n relevant facts, circumstances, or information but deliberately ignores them.\n For reckless disregard, if the parent has been presented with the relevant\n facts, circumstances, or information and recklessly disregards them, the\n parent\u2019s failure to protect can be considered knowing.\n\nIn re Markus E., 671 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Tenn. 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402 provides, as relevant:\n\n(c) \u201cSerious bodily injury to the child\u201d includes, but is not limited to, second-\n or third-degree burns, a fracture of any bone, a concussion, subdural or\n -20-\n\f subarachnoid bleeding, retinal hemorrhage, cerebral edema, brain contusion,\n injuries to the skin that involve severe bruising or the likelihood of permanent\n or protracted disfigurement, including those sustained by whipping children\n with objects and acts of female genital mutilation as defined in \u00a7 39-13-110.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402(c) (West eff. July 1, 2019).\n\nMother challenges the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings that she committed severe child\nabuse. She asserts that, while the Juvenile Court focused on Kenna\u2019s risk for \u201crefeeding\nsyndrome,\u201d refeeding syndrome was not an abusive act by Mother but simply a result of\nincreasing caloric intake to a malnourished person. Mother argues further that there was\nno basis for the Juvenile Court\u2019s finding that Mother\u2019s striking Kenna with her fists or a\nbroom were likely to cause a broken nose or a concussion.\n\nThe Juvenile Court made detailed factual findings regarding Mother\u2019s abusive acts\ntoward Kenna. The evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s factual\nfindings. Furthermore, the Juvenile Court credited Kenna\u2019s testimony, including her\naccount of suffering at Mother\u2019s hands. We defer to a trial court\u2019s credibility determination\nabsent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Kelly v. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 692\n(Tenn. 2014). This record contains no clear and convincing evidence that would serve to\noverturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s credibility determinations regarding Kenna or any of the\nother witnesses.\n\nThe record reveals that Mother brutally abused Kenna by starving and beating her.\nMother\u2019s emphasis on refeeding syndrome misses the forest for the trees. Had Mother not\nstarved Kenna in the first place, Kenna would not have been at risk for refeeding syndrome.\nMother\u2019s abusive acts led to Kenna becoming gravely malnourished. This Court has\npreviously recognized malnourishment as a basis for sustaining the ground of severe child\nabuse. See In re Keara J., 376 S.W.3d 86, 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2012) (\u201c[W]e conclude that\nthe evidence overwhelmingly establishes Keara as a severely abused child who was\nsuffering the effects of knowing nutritional and physical neglect in her parents\u2019 care.\u201d).\nHere, Mother purposefully deprived Kenna of sufficient food, leading to Kenna becoming\nseverely emaciated. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s condition was such that she faced likely\nstarvation or death, had it continued. Had it not been for the intervention of law\nenforcement, Kenna might well have died of starvation thanks to Mother. Mother\u2019s\nstarvation of Kenna constituted severe child abuse under any definition of the term.\n\nMother also takes issue with the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings regarding her beatings of\nKenna. The Juvenile Court found that, while Kenna had not suffered any broken bones or\na concussion, \u201cbeing struck in the head by [Mother] with her fists and a broom was likely\nto cause a broken nose or concussion.\u201d Mother contends that this finding has no basis. We\n -21-\n\fdisagree. The Juvenile Court\u2019s findings reflect the common sense understanding that an\nadult repeatedly striking a child in the face with fists and/or various hard objects is likely\nto cause that child to have a broken nose or concussion. Mother\u2019s actions toward Kenna\nwent far beyond any legitimate discipline and fell squarely into the statutory definition of\nacts likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n\nAs a final point on this issue, Mother argues strenuously that since Kenna was not\nher child, she should not be held to the duties of a parent or guardian. Mother\u2019s argument\nis without merit. The ground for parental rights at issue, (g)(4), provides for termination\nwhen \u201c[t]he parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child abuse . . .\nagainst any child[.]\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30,\n2022) (emphasis added). Thus, it does not matter that Kenna was not Mother\u2019s child. The\nGeneral Assembly has decided that inflicting severe abuse on any child, not only one\u2019s\nbiological or legal child, will sustain the ground of severe child abuse. We find, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that the ground of severe child abuse was proven against Mother by clear\nand convincing evidence.\n\nWe next address whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. On May 25, 2022, when DCS\nfiled its petition, the best interest factors read as follows:\n\n(i)(1) In determining whether termination of parental or guardianship rights\n is in the best interest of the child, the court shall consider all relevant and\n child-centered factors applicable to the particular case before the court.\n Those factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n (A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the child\u2019s critical\n need for stability and continuity of placement throughout the child\u2019s\n minority;\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to\n have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical condition;\n (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability in meeting\n the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety needs;\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy parental\n attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable expectation that the\n parent can create such attachment;\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with\n the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate a positive\n relationship with the child;\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home;\n\n-22-\n\f(G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s household\ntrigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or post-traumatic\nsymptoms;\n(H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson or persons in the absence of the parent;\n(I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships with persons\nother than parents and caregivers, including biological or foster siblings, and\nthe likely impact of various available outcomes on these relationships and\nthe child\u2019s access to information about the child\u2019s heritage;\n(J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and beneficial for the\nchild to be in the home of the parent, including consideration of whether there\nis criminal activity in the home or by the parent, or the use of alcohol,\ncontrolled substances, or controlled substance analogues which may render\nthe parent unable to consistently care for the child in a safe and stable\nmanner;\n(K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available programs, services,\nor community resources to assist in making a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions;\n(L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent\nin making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in the custody of\nthe department;\n(M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in establishing\npaternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or addressing the\ncircumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award of custody unsafe\nand not in the child\u2019s best interest;\n(N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or frequenting the\nhome of the parent, has shown brutality or physical, sexual, emotional, or\npsychological abuse or neglect toward the child or any other child or adult;\n(O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for the child\nor any other child;\n(P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the basic and\nspecific needs required for the child to thrive;\n(Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and commitment to\ncreating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s basic and specific\nneeds and in which the child can thrive;\n(R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is healthy and\nsafe for the child;\n(S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token financial\nsupport for the child; and\n\n-23-\n\f (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would be\n detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n (2) When considering the factors set forth in subdivision (i)(1), the prompt\n and permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is presumed to\n be in the child\u2019s best interest.\n (3) All factors considered by the court to be applicable to a particular case\n must be identified and supported by specific findings of fact in the court\u2019s\n written order.\n (4) Expert testimony is not required to prove or disprove any factor by any\n party.\n (5) As used in this subsection (i), \u201cparent\u201d includes guardian.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nMother argues that the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest analysis. According\nto Mother, she \u201chas not had a meaningful opportunity to meet the needs of her children in\nmore than two and a half years\u201d because DCS took the Children from her. Mother says it\nwas wrong for the Juvenile Court to hold this separation against her because it presumes\nthat she did what she was accused of doing. Mother also points out that, despite Kenna\u2019s\ncondition, the Children appeared to have been properly fed and were not bruised. In\nessence, Mother argues that, regardless of what she may have done to Kenna, the Children\nwere fine in her care. Mother also says that the Juvenile Court wrongly held her decision\nnot to testify against her.\n\nImplicit to Mother\u2019s argument is that she merely is alleged to have abused Kenna.\nHowever, a bench trial has been held in this matter. The Juvenile Court found that Mother\ncommitted severe child abuse against Kenna based upon its findings that Mother starved\nand beat Kenna. We have found nothing in the record to overturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s\nfactual findings. On the contrary, the record fully supports the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings.\nMother\u2019s abuse of Kenna no longer is a mere allegation\u2014it is an adjudicated fact. It was\nMother\u2019s abusive actions that led to the Children\u2019s removal and her separation from them.\nMother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take responsibility for it, is the\nweightiest factor in this matter. Regarding Mother\u2019s argument that the Children appeared\nnormal despite Kenna\u2019s condition, that is both insufficient and misleading. The Children\nwere in the same household where Mother\u2019s brutality and violence against Kenna unfolded.\nAnnabelle and Jasmine required therapy and fell behind educationally. While the Children\nmay not have been subjected to the same horrors that Mother inflicted on Kenna, they were\nnevertheless exposed to a climate of abuse and fear. Thus, it is inaccurate to suggest that\nthe Children somehow led normal lives notwithstanding what Mother did to Kenna. It was\nappropriate for the Juvenile Court to consider Mother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna in\n -24-\n\fconcluding that the Children were at risk of facing similar abuse should they be returned\nto Mother\u2019s care. There is no hint that Mother understands the severity of what she did to\nKenna or even that what she did to Kenna was wrong. Finally, regarding Mother\u2019s\nassertion that the Juvenile Court held her refusal to testify against her, we find that not to\nbe the case. The Juvenile Court did not punish Mother for declining to testify. It merely\nnoted that Mother could have shed more light on certain factors had she chosen to testify.\nThat was a correct observation by the Juvenile Court. Mother chose not to testify, and the\nJuvenile Court was by necessity limited to the evidence adduced from other sources. In\nsum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as to each applicable best interest factor.\nThe evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We\nfind by clear and convincing evidence, as did the Juvenile Court, that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. We affirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s\njudgment terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights to the Children.\n\nWe next address Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. Father does not contest the ground\nof severe child abuse found against him. All the same, under our Supreme Court\u2019s holding\nin In re Carrington H., we are required to address it. The Juvenile Court made detailed\nfindings regarding Father\u2019s role in the severe abuse suffered by Kenna. Father stood by\nwhile his daughter was starved and suffered beatings at Mother\u2019s hands. Father even\npointed a gun at Kenna on occasion. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground of\nsevere child abuse was proven against Father by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThe final issue we address is whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that\ntermination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. On this issue, Father\nmakes several contentions as to why he believes the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest\nanalysis. Father states that he has appropriate housing; that he is employed; that he\ncompleted a parenting assessment; that he completed an alcohol and drug program; that his\nvisits with Liam were appropriate; that he has completed the tasks required of him; and\nthat Liam liked seeing him on visits. According to Father, the Juvenile Court did not give\nenough weight to these positives in its analysis.\n\nFather is correct in that he did certain positive things during the custodial period.\nThe Juvenile Court recognized as much in its order. For example, the Juvenile Court found\nthat the factor concerning visitation weighed against terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to\nLiam. The record reflects that Liam was happy to see Father on visits. By the same\nmeasure, however, the record reflects that Liam is happy in general. In any event, the\nJuvenile Court did not utterly discount Father\u2019s positive acts. Even still, hinging upon \u201cthe\ncircumstances of a particular child and a particular parent, the consideration of one factor\nmay very well dictate the outcome of the analysis.\u201d In re Gabriella D., 531 S.W.3d 662,\n682 (Tenn. 2017) (quoting In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 878 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).\n -25-\n\fUnder the circumstances of this case, severe child abuse is the paramount concern. Father\nstood by while his daughter Kenna was starved and beaten by Mother. Father even\ncontributed to the abuse by pointing a gun at Kenna on occasion. There is no hint that\nFather has ever taken responsibility for the brutality Kenna endured. Instead, Father\nblamed Kenna. Father\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take\nresponsibility for it, outweighs his positive actions and poses the real risk that Liam could\nsuffer similar abuse in Father\u2019s care. In sum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as\nto each applicable best interest factor. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find by clear and convincing evidence, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that termination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. We\naffirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe judgment of the Juvenile Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the\nJuvenile Court for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed 50% to\nthe Appellant, Rikiya P., and 50% to the Appellant, Daniel R., and their surety, if any.\n\n____________________________________\n D.

The circuit court found that it was timely accepted and that a\n\nbinding settlement agreement was formed. Over the wife\u2019s objection, the court entered a\n\njudgment for absolute divorce based on mutual consent. The court incorporated (but did\n\nnot merge) the settlement agreement into the judgment. The Appellate Court of Maryland\n\ndisagreed and reversed the judgment of the circuit court. We affirm the judgment of the\n\nAppellate Court.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nThis contested divorce case was commenced by Petitioner Todd Pattison\n\n(\u201cHusband\u201d) on May 24, 2019, when he filed a complaint for an absolute divorce against\n\nRespondent Deborah Pattison (\u201cWife\u201d), who filed a counterclaim the following month. The\n\nparties alleged various grounds for divorce, none of which are relevant here.\n\nTrial was scheduled to begin on October 5, 2020. On September 16, 2020, over\n\nWife\u2019s objection, the court postponed the trial until March 2021. Two days later, the parties\n\nattended a pretrial/settlement conference at which they spent approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a retired judge. No settlement was reached.\n\nOn Friday, September 25, 2020, Wife\u2019s counsel sent a hand-delivered settlement\n\npackage to Husband\u2019s counsel containing a Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement\n\nAgreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), bearing Wife\u2019s signature. Among other terms, the\n\nAgreement provided that, \u201c[i]n order to balance the equities of the parties in and to their\n\nproperties, Husband shall pay to Wife a monetary award . . . in the amount of $760,000.00\n\fto be paid\u201d in six installments over two and one-half years. To secure this obligation, the\n\nAgreement required Husband to execute a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d), attached as\n\nExhibit A to the Agreement. The Agreement also stated that Husband\u2019s business and living\n\ntrust \u201cshall guarantee payment of this monetary award obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an\n\nunconditional guaranty (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d) was included in the settlement package.\n\nThe cover letter with the proposed Agreement stated:\n\nEnclosed please find two (2) signed, initialed and notarized originals\n of the Pattison Marital Settlement Agreement for counter-execution by your\n client. A redlined copy of the pages of the Agreement depicting my revisions\n to the version which you sent to me yesterday is also attached; note that non-\n substantive changes were also made at pages 5, 6 and 8 in addition to the\n \u201crepairs\u201d language on pages 3-4. Further note that changes to page 8 were\n made in order to reflect the fact that there is a Note to be paid according to\n its terms and that the Guarantors will not be signing the Note itself.\n\nAlso enclosed is the final version of the Promissory Note (Ex. A) and\n the form of the Guaranty which has been approved by [Wife].\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nHusband received the settlement package by email that same day, but signed the\n\ndocuments the following Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, Husband filed an amended complaint seeking an absolute\n\ndivorce based on mutual consent. See MD. CODE ANN., FAM. LAW (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 7-103(a)(3)\n\n(2019 Repl. Vol.). Among other things, Husband alleged that he and Wife entered into the\n\fAgreement. He requested that the court incorporate but not merge the Agreement into a\n\njudgment of absolute divorce.\n\nWife timely answered the amended complaint on October 12, 2020, alleging that\n\nHusband failed to timely accept her settlement offer and that, therefore, the Agreement was\n\na nullity.\n\nHusband moved to enforce the settlement agreement on October 16, 2020. The court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on March 16, 2021. Husband and Wife both testified. The\n\ncircuit court granted Husband\u2019s motion. The court recognized that settlement agreements\n\nare contracts, and that mutual assent is an \u201cessential prerequisite to the creation or\n\nformation of a contract.\u201d The court then analyzed the language of the Agreement and\n\nconcluded that its plain terms were definite and reflected the parties\u2019 intent to be bound.\n\nThe court rejected Wife\u2019s argument that her offer was conditioned on Husband\n\nsigning the Agreement on September 25, 2020. The court acknowledged that the cover\n\nletter contained language \u201cindicating\u201d a condition that Husband needed to sign the\n\nAgreement on September 25, 2020, but that Husband \u201cdenie[d]\u201d that the letter imposed a\n\n\u201chard deadline, and point[ed] to language\u201d in the letter \u201cindicating an expectation that the\n\nagreement would be finalized by the following week.\u201d The court weighed the credibility\n\nof the witnesses and concluded that Wife\u2019s offer did not include \u201ca definite time expiration\n\nof September 25th, 2020.\u201d The court stated that even if it did, \u201ccontract formation still\n\nwould have occurred through the action of the parties.\u201d The court did not explain the factual\n\nbasis for that finding, but instead proceeded to find that even if Wife had imposed a hard\n\ndeadline, she waived it.\n\f To that end, the court stated that \u201cthe evidence presented at the hearing indicated\n\nthat counsel was in communication throughout the day and the parties were being updated\n\nby their respective counsel.\u201d The court reasoned:\n\nAt some point on the 25th [Husband] indicated through counsel that\n he would not be able to sign the agreement until Monday.\n There is no evidence presented to indicate that [Wife] rejected\n [Husband]\u2019s offer to sign the agreement on Monday, the 28th, rather than\n Friday. In fact, the evidence indicates a willingness to accept the separation\n [agreement] from [Husband] on Monday.\n As a result, [Husband] signed and returned the separation agreement\n on September 28th, 2020.\n Importantly, the first time the issue of untimeliness was raised by\n [Wife] was when she filed her answer to the amended complaint 17 days\n later. [Wife]\u2019s failure to raise the issue until 17 days after [Husband] accepted\n her offer constitutes a waiver of the requirement to sign the separation\n agreement on the 25th.\n\nCiting section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, 1 the court stated:\n\nan offeror who has imposed a time limit in its offer does not in fact insist\n upon it, and by further negotiations the offeror may indicate a continued\n willingness to stand by the terms of its offer. Any such manifestation of\n continued willingness on the part of the offeror will extend the time during\n which acceptance may occur, constituting in effect a new offer which may\n be accepted, and if so accepted, will ripen into a contract.\n\nSee 1 Samuel Williston & Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 5:5 (4th\n\ned.).\n\nFrom there, the court determined that it was \u201cnot persuaded that [Wife] was\n\nunwilling to extend the time during which acceptance [could] occur after learning that\n The circuit court cited to section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, \u201cLapse by\nexpiration of time stated in offer.\u201d In the May 2025 updated version of Williston on\nContracts, that passage is found in section 5:7.\n\f[Husband] was unable to perform\u201d on September 25. Thus, the court found \u201cthat mutual\n\nconsent of the parties to form a contract, namely the [Agreement], ha[d] occurred.\u201d\n\nB\n\nWife noted an appeal. The Appellate Court of Maryland dismissed her appeal\n\nbecause no final judgment had been entered. Pattison v. Pattison, 254 Md. App. 294\n\n(2022).\n\nOn remand, the court granted Husband an absolute divorce by mutual consent and\n\nincorporated but did not merge the Agreement into the divorce decree.\n\nWife appealed again, and in a reported opinion, the Appellate Court reversed.\n\nPattison v. Pattison, 262 Md. App. 504 (2024). The court found that no contract was\n\nformed because Husband failed to execute the Agreement by the end of the day on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, as required by Wife\u2019s explicitly stated condition. Id. at 529, 534-35.\n\nThe court also found no evidence supporting the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Wife had\n\nwaived this condition. Id. at 534.\n\nWe granted Husband\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. Pattison v. Pattison, 489 Md.\n\n243 (2024).\n\nII\n\nA\n\nHusband contends that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement because Wife signed the document on September 25, 2020, and he signed it on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020. He argues that Wife accepted the terms of the Agreement through her\n\nsignature, and that her condition for same-day execution was not part of the Agreement but\n\fwas rather an extrinsic attempt to change its terms. To that end, Husband argues that the\n\nintegration clause in the Agreement\u2014which states that the document contains the entire\n\nunderstanding of the parties\u2014precludes consideration of the condition in the cover letter.\n\nTo support his position, Husband points to his testimony at the hearing that he did\n\nnot interpret the cover letter as imposing a hard deadline of September 25. Husband\n\ntestified: \u201cMy interpretation was [Wife\u2019s counsel] needed all the executed documents by\n\nMonday, because without the personal guarant[y] and the promissory note the settlement\n\nagreement is unenforceable.\u201d\n\nHusband argues that even if the cover letter imposed an acceptance deadline, it was\n\nan unreasonable condition. According to Husband, that\u2019s because the parties\u2019 attorneys\n\ncommunicated on the morning of September 25, and Wife\u2019s counsel knew that nobody\n\nwould be at Husband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office to accept delivery of the settlement package. He\n\nargues that the email with the settlement package was not received by his counsel until\n\n3:51 p.m., \u201cjust over an hour from the close of the business day.\u201d Husband contends that\n\nhe did not receive the original package until September 28. Relying on Canaras v. Lift\n\nTruck Services, Inc., 272 Md. 337 (1974), Husband argues that \u201c[w]hether a provision in a\n\ncontract is a condition the nonfulfillment of which excuses performance depends upon the\n\nintent of the parties to be ascertained from a fair and reasonable construction of the\n\nlanguage used in light of all the surrounding circumstance[s] when they executed the\n\ncontract.\u201d\n\nHusband also relies on section 41 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts for the\n\nproposition that whether an offer is accepted within a reasonable amount of time \u201cis a\n\fquestion of fact[,] depending on all the circumstances existing when the offer and attempted\n\nacceptance are made.\u201d And he argues that he \u201cacted as quickly and as reasonably under\n\nthe facts and circumstances of this case as he could\u201d to fully execute the settlement\n\ndocuments.\n\nFinally, Husband contends that even if Wife imposed a September 25 deadline for\n\nacceptance, she waived it. According to Husband, Wife never communicated her rejection\n\nof the Agreement until she responded to his motion to enforce the Agreement. And, he\n\nmaintains, the circuit court determined that Wife knew Husband could not sign the\n\ndocuments until Monday and that Husband\u2019s counsel was not in his office to accept their\n\ndelivery. Thus, he argues, the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in finding that\n\nWife \u201cwaived strict compliance with her attempted condition[.]\u201d\n\nB\n\nProperty settlement agreements are analyzed under the same principles as other\n\ncontracts. Bruce v. Dyer, 309 Md. 421, 439 (1987). 2 Mutual assent is a prerequisite to the\n In a divorce proceeding, one of the benefits of entering into a property settlement\nagreement is that it provides a basis to obtain a divorce on an expedited basis based on\nmutual consent. But to do that, the parties must put their agreement in writing and submit\nit to the court, which in turn must make a finding that the best interests of the parties\u2019 minor\nchildren, if any, are served by the agreement. FL \u00a7 7-103(a)(3). There is no dispute that\nHusband and Wife intended to put in writing any agreement they reached so that they could\nproceed with a divorce on that basis. This is important because the dissent seems to think\nthat because Wife and Husband, through their counsel, negotiated and agreed upon the\nvarious terms of the Agreement in the days and hours leading up to Wife signing the\nAgreement, there was no going back\u2014that those terms were final and binding before either\nparty even signed the Agreement. To the contrary, it is clear from the testimony that neither\nparty intended to be bound until the Agreement was finalized and signed, and neither party\nargued to the contrary in this Court.\n\fformation of a contract, which means that the contract terms are definite and that the parties\n\nintend to be bound by them. Cochran v. Norkunas, 398 Md. 1, 14 (2007). And \u201cthe\n\nacceptance of the other party must correspond with the offer in its entirety.\u201d Peoples Drug\n\nStores v. Fenton Realty Corp., 191 Md. 489, 494 (1948). Here, neither party contends that\n\nthe proposed Agreement\u2019s terms were not certain or definite. And both parties agree that\n\nWife was the offeror. The sole issue is whether there was an offer and acceptance, without\n\nwhich there can be no mutual assent.\n\nAn offer can come with or without conditions. As this Court stated 92 years ago:\n\nSince the offeror was at liberty to make no offer, it was free to determine and\n impose whatever terms it might choose, and among these it might require\n that its offer be accepted within a designated time in a specific manner. If no\n acceptance is made in the manner and within the period fixed by the offer,\n the offer necessarily expires. Williston on Contracts, secs. 53, 61, 76; Van\n Camp Packing Co. v. Smith, 101 Md. 565, 61 A. 284.\n\nAm. Med. Spirits Co. v. Mayor & City Council of Balt., 165 Md. 128, 133 (1933). This\n\ntime-tested rule makes sense: Contracts are voluntary undertakings; thus, it\u2019s not the\n\ncourt\u2019s place to pass judgment on the wisdom, necessity, or fairness of the conditions an\n\nofferor attaches to her offer. Perhaps Wife had her reasons; perhaps not. Legally, it doesn\u2019t\n\nmatter.\n\nNor does it matter what Husband thought the cover letter meant. An offer is\n\ninterpreted based on \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have\n\nthought it meant.\u201d Ray v. Eurice & Bros., Inc., 201 Md. 115, 127 (1952) (quoting 1 Samuel\n\nWilliston & George J. Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 94 (2d ed.)). As\n\nwe explained 73 years ago:\n\f Williston . . . states the rule as follows: \u201cThe only intent of the parties to a\n contract which is essential[] is an intent to say the words and do the acts\n which constitute their manifestation[s] of assent.\u201d\n\nId. at 127 (quoting 1 Williston & Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 21). 3\n\nHere, there was no ambiguity in the September 25 signature deadline; thus, its\n\ninterpretation is a matter of law that we review without deference. See Adventist\n\nHealthcare, Inc. v. Behram, 488 Md. 410, 432 (2024) (\u201cThe interpretation of a contract,\n\nincluding the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law\n\nreviewed without deference.\u201d). Whether the letter imposed a hard signature deadline does\n\nnot hinge on the credibility of the parties\u2019 respective testimony. What matters is what the\n\ncover letter said and the legal effect of its words.\n\nThe cover letter stated:\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nAlthough the letter was not admitted into evidence, the contents of the entire first\n\nparagraph above were elicited verbatim and confirmed by both Husband and Wife in their\n\ntestimony. The letter expressly distinguishes between the Agreement and Note, which had\n\nto be signed on September 25, and the Guaranty, which could be signed on September 28.\n\nThus, any reasonable person in the parties\u2019 positions would understand that Wife\u2019s offer\n See footnote 4 for an explanation of the legal effect of the words used to express\nan offer.\n\fwas conditioned on Husband signing the Agreement and Note on September 25.\n\nConversely, no reasonable person would perceive any flexibility in that deadline.\n\nC\n\nThat Wife imposed the condition in the cover letter and not within the four corners\n\nof the Agreement is also irrelevant. \u201cIt is hornbook law that an offer of no specified\n\nduration must be accepted within a time reasonable under the circumstances or the offer\n\nwill lapse and a subsequent attempt to accept will be of no effect.\u201d Barnes v. Euster, 240\n\nMd. 603, 607 (1965). It is equally true that \u201can offer that has been extended, but not yet\n\naccepted, generally can be withdrawn by the offeror.\u201d Hall v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty.\n\nDemocratic Cent. Comm., 431 Md. 108, 131 (2013); see also Lemlich v. Bd. of Trs. of\n\nHarford Cmty. Coll., 282 Md. 495, 502 (1978) (\u201cIt is so basic a contract principle that\n\nminimal supporting authority is needed to authorize the statement that there must exist an\n\noffer by one party and an unconditional acceptance of that precise offer by the other, prior\n\nto withdrawal by the offeror, before a binding agreement is born.\u201d); Coleman v.\n\nApplegarth, 68 Md. 21, 29 (1887).\n\nThe withdrawal of a condition can be communicated in various ways, including\n\nthrough written communication. See Pavel Enters., Inc. v. A.S. Johnson Co., Inc., 342 Md.\n\n143, 163 (1996) (finding that the offer was withdrawn by the offeror by a letter to the\n\nofferee expressing an intent to withdraw); James L. Kernan Co. v. Cook, 162 Md. 137, 143\n\n(1932) (finding that an offer had been revoked via a letter from the offeror). Obviously, no\n\nmatter how the offeror communicates a withdrawal, one thing is certain: a withdrawal\n\nwould never be contained in the proposed contract; that is, an offeror cannot\n\fsimultaneously extend and withdraw an offer. So even if Wife had not imposed any\n\ncondition in her cover letter, and so long as Husband had not already accepted it, she could\n\nhave withdrawn the offer in a separate letter at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, September 26, or\n\nat any other time of her choosing. The only difference here is that Wife communicated the\n\nexpiration of the offer in advance, when she conveyed the offer. Basic logic dictates that if\n\nthe withdrawal of an offer can be (and always is) communicated outside of the proposed\n\ncontract after the offer is made, so too can a deadline for accepting an offer when the offer\n\nis made.\n\nD\n\nWe turn now to Husband\u2019s contention that Wife waived compliance with the\n\nSeptember 25 signature deadline. Waiver is \u201cthe intentional relinquishment of a known\n\nright.\u201d Taylor v. Mandel, 402 Md. 109, 135 (2007). Waiver must be clearly communicated\n\nor implied from the circumstances. See Myers v. Kayhoe, 391 Md. 188, 205 (2006) (stating\n\nthat waiver \u201cmust be clearly established and will not be inferred from equivocal acts or\n\nlanguage\u201d); Canaras, 272 Md. at 360-61 (stating that for waiver to be established through\n\nimplication or mutual understanding, there must be evidence of a party\u2019s conduct\n\ndemonstrating relinquishment of a right).\n\nHusband leans heavily on his contention that the circuit court found that Wife knew\n\nHusband could not sign the documents until Monday and that Wife knew Husband\u2019s\n\ncounsel was not at the office to take delivery of the settlement package. Even if those facts\n\nwere true, it would not matter. An offeror\u2019s freedom to impose any conditions on her offer\n\nis not constrained by the offeree\u2019s ability, or lack thereof, to satisfy those conditions.\n\f Wife\u2019s silence after receiving the documents from Husband on September 28\n\nlikewise did not constitute a waiver. When Husband signed the documents on September\n\n28, Wife\u2019s offer had already expired, see Am. Med. Spirits Co., 165 Md. at 133, and thus,\n\nthere was no offer for Husband to accept. As a matter of law, when Husband delivered the\n\nsigned documents to Wife (through counsel) on September 28, Husband made his own\n\noffer\u2014some would call it a counteroffer\u2014to Wife. That counteroffer put the power of\n\nacceptance in Wife\u2019s hands, as the new offeree. Wife had no duty to respond to Husband\u2019s\n\ncounteroffer, and there is no evidence that she did respond, either in words or in deeds,\n\nuntil she timely filed her answer to Husband\u2019s amended complaint, in which she\n\nunambiguously disputed the validity of the Agreement.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that silence can never amount to an acceptance. Acceptance\n\nthrough silence can occur if: (1) the parties agreed to that effect in advance, (2) there was\n\na prior course of dealings that indicated such an understanding, or (3) the offeree accepts\n\nany benefits of the agreement. See id. But there is no evidence to support any of those\n\nexceptions here. Thus, Wife\u2019s mere silence, without more, was not an acceptance of\n\nHusband\u2019s offer. See Cochran, 398 Md. at 23-24.\n\nE\n\nHusband argues that the circuit court improperly excluded evidence of the parties\u2019\n\ncommunications in the days and hours leading up to the hand delivery of the Agreement to\n\nHusband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office. As he did before the Appellate Court, Husband argues that, at\n\na minimum, we should remand the matter for the circuit court to consider those exhibits.\n\nWe have considered all the exhibits in the record, and we determine that, as a matter of\n\flaw, no contract was formed due to Husband\u2019s failure to adhere to Wife\u2019s deadline, and\n\nthat the evidence, including the excluded exhibits, does not support the circuit court\u2019s\n\nwaiver finding.\n\nThose emails, had they been admitted, would have established the following:\n\n\u2022 September 24 at 9:37 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel responded to Husband\u2019s proposals\n regarding personal property and financial responsibility for home repairs. Wife\u2019s\n counsel closed the email saying: \u201cIf this is acceptable, I will include your\n revisions in the Agreement, add the repair language above, and have [Wife] sign\n the Agreement for your client\u2019s counter-signing.\u201d Thus, Husband was on notice\n to expect the signed documents from Wife that same day.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 8:16 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel emailed to Wife\u2019s counsel a draft\n of the Guaranty with both counsel\u2019s and Husband\u2019s corporate counsel\u2019s\n comments and edits. Husband\u2019s counsel advised that \u201c[Husband\u2019s corporate\n counsel] has not addressed some things still.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:17 a.m.: Referring to the Guaranty, Wife\u2019s counsel asked\n Husband\u2019s counsel: \u201cWhen can we expect [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\u2019s final\n comments? If not done this morning, I suppose this will have to be done next\n week sometime.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:40 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cWe can execute the\n other documents today though. I have no problem with that. The Guaranty is\n agreed.\u201d Thus, it was Husband\u2019s counsel, not Wife\u2019s counsel, who planted the\n idea that Husband would sign the Agreement and Note, but not the Guaranty,\n that same day. Husband\u2019s counsel never retracted that suggestion.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:52 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel proposed revised language\n regarding the repairs to the marital home before it could be sold and told\n Husband\u2019s counsel that Husband\u2019s proposed changes to the Guaranty were\n accepted \u201cexcept for the striking of the attorneys[\u2019] fees provision. My partner\n has included the same 10% attorneys[\u2019] fees provision as is in the Promissory\n Note.\u201d The email closed with: \u201cIf these changes are accepted, we can finish up.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 11:04 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI sent this to [Husband].\u201d\n And referring to the proposed changes to the home repair provisions, Husband\u2019s\n counsel said, \u201cI am fine with it as long as it is clear it is an exception to the\n\f general language that [Husband] is solely responsible for upkeep of the house\n and bills.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 1:59 p.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel attached a revised Guaranty\n reflecting the change to the attorneys\u2019 fees provision mentioned in the prior\n email, and informed Husband\u2019s counsel that: \u201cthe signed and notarized\n Agreement, the Note and Guaranty will be delivered to your office in the next\n half hour. The [cover] letter is attached to this e-mail as well.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s\n counsel was informed about the signature deadline in the early afternoon of\n September 25. And Husband testified that he saw that email and was aware that\n the signed Agreement and Note would be delivered to his counsel\u2019s office.\n Husband testified that he received the cover letter attached to that email.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:31 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\n is there.\u201d This was when Wife\u2019s counsel first learned that Husband\u2019s counsel\n was not in his office.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:39 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel told Wife\u2019s counsel that he asked\n Husband\u2019s corporate counsel to expedite his review of the Guaranty and stated:\n \u201cIf it needs to be edited at all I will let you know.\u201d Husband\u2019s counsel added:\n \u201cFortunately [Husband] was ok with the principle regarding the house repairs as\n you set forth in your earlier email. I do need to review myself and if I have any\n tweak[s] I will let you know.\u201d Thus, Husband was engaged in the settlement\n process on September 25, notwithstanding his illness.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:27 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel wrote to Wife\u2019s counsel: \u201cI know\n you are out, and am sorry to bother. But could you have someone send me via\n email the version of the Separation Agreement you had her sing [sic] and sent to\n my office please. I am not there at all today.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s counsel\n appreciated the importance of getting the documents to Husband for his\n signature that day, as opposed to waiting for the following Monday.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:57 p.m.: Responding to Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s 1:59 p.m. email,\n Husband\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cThis should be fine. [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\n had no more additions.\u201d Again, no mention of any concern with the signature\n deadline.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:51 p.m.: Someone from Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s office emailed the\n settlement agreement package to Husband\u2019s counsel as requested in the latter\u2019s\n email at 3:27 p.m.\n\f These emails would have provided no support for the circuit court\u2019s finding that\n\nHusband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer or that Wife waived the signature deadline. Thus,\n\nwe agree with the Appellate Court that a remand for that purpose is unnecessary. 4\n\nJUDGMENT OF THE APPELLATE\n COURT OF MARYLAND\n We respectfully disagree with the analysis of our dissenting colleagues. This case\nis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about whether the Agreement constituted a\nbinding contract under basic principles of offer and acceptance. The dissent\u2019s reliance on\nthe terms of the Agreement, including the provisions confirming the voluntariness of the\nparties\u2019 signatures, the effective date of September 25, 2020, the integration clause, and\nothers, are misplaced. For the same reason, so too is the dissent\u2019s reliance on the parol\nevidence rule. Had Husband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer, all the terms of the Agreement\nwould have been binding, and parol evidence would not have been permitted to vary them.\n The dissent contends that we should attribute no significance to the cover letter\nbecause it was excluded as hearsay. But the dissent overlooks that both parties, in their\ntestimony, testified about and confirmed the cover letter\u2019s contents verbatim, and without\nobjection. So even if the substance of the cover letter constituted hearsay, any objection on\nthat basis was waived, as its contents were in evidence and undisputed. Thus, the existence\nof the September 25th deadline for the execution of the Agreement did not hinge on\nanyone\u2019s credibility.\n The dissent\u2019s focus on the hearsay issue underscores a broader misunderstanding of\nthe legal import of the cover letter and the evidentiary purpose it served. \u201c\u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). The\ncontents of the cover letter were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather\nfor the legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter\nwith such contents constituted an act with independent legal significance. See State v.\nYoung, 462 Md. 159, 175 (2018).\n Such acts include the making and acceptance of an offer. Garner v. State, 414 Md.\n372, 382 (2010). For example, if a person were to say to a car owner \u201cI offer you $200 for\nyour car and the offer expires in 15 minutes,\u201d that statement would be admissible for the\nlegal effect of uttering those words, which are twofold: (1) the person offered to buy the\ncar for $200 and put the power of acceptance in the owner\u2019s hands; and (2) the owner\u2019s\npower of acceptance expires in 15 minutes. If the owner wasn\u2019t listening and did not learn\nabout the offer until after it expired (perhaps when the person later said to the owner that\nthe person was surprised that the owner didn\u2019t accept it), as a matter of law, this would not\nmatter. Nor would it matter that the owner never agreed to the unilateral deadline. As the\nofferor, the person had the unfettered unilateral right to dictate the terms of the offer and\nany acceptance deadline. The same principles apply here.\n\f AFFIRMED.

PATTISON\n\nv.\n\nDEBORAH PATTISON\n\n______________________________________\n\nFader, C.J.,\n Watts,\n Booth,\n Biran,\n Gould,\n Eaves,\n Killough,\n\nJJ.\n ______________________________________\n\nDissenting Opinion by Killough, J., which\n Eaves, J., joins.\n ______________________________________\n\nFiled: July 23, 2025\n\f I respectfully dissent from the Majority\u2019s opinion reversing the trial court\u2019s\n\nenforcement of the marital settlement agreement in this case. In my view, the Majority\u2019s\n\nframing of the case through an \u201coffer and acceptance\u201d construct is misplaced. The parties\n\nhad already negotiated and agreed to all material terms of a settlement, reduced that\n\nagreement to writing, and Respondent (referred to herein as \u201cWife\u201d or \u201cMs. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned, initialed, and notarized the agreement. Her signature reflected her unequivocal\n\nassent to be bound. When Petitioner (referred to herein as \u201cHusband\u201d or \u201cMr. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned the agreement on September 28, 2020, there was no open offer left to accept or\n\nreject \u2013 only a binding agreement to be enforced.\n\nThe Majority cites no case \u2013 and I am aware of none \u2013 in which a court has set aside\n\na fully executed, integrated agreement based solely on a purported condition precedent\n\nfound in an extrinsic document. Yet that is precisely the result the Majority reaches.\n\nAccording to the Majority, \u201cany reasonable person\u201d would have understood Wife\u2019s\n\ndirective that Husband sign the agreement on September 25, 2020, as a binding condition\n\nprecedent to contract formation, and \u201c[c]onversely, no reasonable person would perceive\n\nany flexibility in that deadline.\u201d Majority Op. at 9-10. But that is not what the trial court\n\nfound. There is no evidence that this so-called \u201cdirective\u201d was timely conveyed to Husband\n\nor that he acknowledged it. This \u201cdirective\u201d was not contained in the agreement, but rather\n\nappeared only in a cover letter dated September 25, 2020, authored by Wife\u2019s counsel and\n\nenclosing the agreement (the \u201cCover Letter\u201d). Husband did not testify that he read the\n\nCover Letter before the deadline passed or that he understood it to impose any binding\n\ncondition. Neither party\u2019s counsel testified as to what, if any, communications occurred\n\fregarding a deadline. Most notably, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as\n\nhearsay.\n\nIn effect, the Majority invalidates a fully executed, integrated settlement agreement\n\nbased entirely on an excluded hearsay document \u2013 a remarkably thin evidentiary reed on\n\nwhich to overturn not only a signed contract but also the trial court\u2019s supported factual\n\nfindings. In my view, the trial court got it right. Given the deference owed to a trial court\u2019s\n\nfindings, and in light of Maryland\u2019s strong policy favoring settlements and the efficient\n\nadministration of justice, see Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., 251 Md. 544, 550 (1968),\n\ncert. denied, 394 U.S. 974 (1969), I would affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n\nI.\n\nFacts\n\nI agree with the factual background set forth in the Majority opinion and will only\n\nsummarize additional facts in this opinion as needed.\n\nAfter a hearing on the Petitioner\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement, the trial judge\n\nruled on March 17, 2021, that the parties had reached a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement following extensive negotiations. After spending approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a former judge of the Supreme Court of Maryland and engaging in nearly\n\nthree weeks of back-and-forth negotiation, the parties agreed on all material terms of a\n\nsettlement and reduced that agreement to writing. The agreement, finalized by Wife\u2019s\n\nattorney, was memorialized in a twelve\u2010page \u201cVoluntary Separation and Property\n\nSettlement Agreement\u201d (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d).\n\f The uncontroverted record shows that Wife signed and initialed each page of the\n\nSettlement Agreement and dated it September 25, 2020. Wife had the Settlement\n\nAgreement notarized, certifying that she personally appeared before the notary to\n\n\u201cexecute[] this Agreement and made oath in due form of law that the matters and facts set\n\nforth in the foregoing Agreement true and correct as stated in the Agreement, and [that she]\n\nacknowledged that the Agreement is in fact her free act and deed and that she has full\n\nunderstanding of its terms.\u201d Husband signed and notarized the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms are undisputed: it became effective on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. The Settlement Agreement is fully integrated and prohibits any\n\namendments without mutual written consent. Both parties declared that the terms of the\n\nagreement were \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d and that they signed the agreement \u201cfreely and\n\nvoluntarily.\u201d Based on its analysis of the agreement, the trial court held that the parties\u2019\n\n\u201cintent can be determined from the unambiguous language in the [Settlement Agreement].\u201d\n\nConsequently, the trial court found that the Settlement Agreement was valid and\n\nenforceable as of September 25, 2020, and that there was mutual assent by the parties to\n\nbe bound by its terms.\n\nWife argued that there was no mutual assent to contract because Husband did not\n\ncomply with her demand in the Cover Letter that he sign the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. In that letter, Wife\u2019s counsel wrote, \u201c[t]his Agreement is delivered\n\nto you in settlement of the parties\u2019 outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement\n\nand Note be executed by Mr. Pattison today.\u201d But the Cover Letter was excluded from\n\fevidence as inadmissible hearsay. During the hearing, however, Wife\u2019s counsel read\n\nexcerpts from the Cover Letter to Husband and he was questioned as to whether he was\n\nfamiliar with the letter. The authors and recipients of the hearsay documents did not testify.\n\nHusband testified that he first saw the original copy of the Settlement Agreement\n\nwith Wife\u2019s signature \u201c[o]n the morning of Monday, September 28th, 2020.\u201d Because he\n\nwas quarantined after testing positive for Covid, he made arrangements with his attorney\n\nto have the Settlement Agreement dropped off on the sidewalk outside his home. He then\n\nsigned the Settlement Agreement, had it notarized, and returned it to his counsel. Husband\n\ntestified that he saw an emailed version of the Settlement Agreement at some point after 5\n\np.m. on Friday, September 25. He was not sure if that email version he saw was signed by\n\nMs. Pattison. No exhibit was admitted into evidence that purported to be the emailed\n\nversion of the Settlement Agreement or Cover Letter. The Cover Letter itself does not\n\nindicate that it was emailed to Mr. Pattison or his counsel but indicates that Ms. Pattison\n\nwas copied on the email.\n\nWife testified that she signed the Settlement Agreement \u201caround noon\u201d on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, and instructed her counsel to deliver it \u201cwith condition that the\n\nAgreement and Note be executed by Mr. Pattison that Friday.\u201d Yet she neither directly\n\ncommunicated that condition to Husband nor did Husband testify specifically that he saw\n\nthe Cover Letter on that date. There is no evidence in the record of whether the attorneys\n\ncommunicated with each other about the deadline contained in the Cover Letter. What we\n\ndo know is that the Settlement Agreement contained no such deadline; Wife never\n\fconveyed one directly; and neither attorney was in the office late Friday afternoon,\n\nSeptember 25, to receive the executed documents.\n\nThe trial court ruled that the language of the Settlement Agreement\n\n\u201cunambiguously[] indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into a[n] . . . agreement\n\non September 25th, 2020 to settle all matters[.]\u201d With respect to the alleged condition\n\nprecedent, all that the trial judge had before her were the parties\u2019 competing testimonies \u2013\n\nHusband\u2019s testimony that he never understood September 25, 2020, to be a firm cutoff, and\n\nWife\u2019s recollections of her instructions to her counsel regarding the alleged condition\n\nprecedent. The trial court relied on neither the Cover Letter nor the emails between counsel\n\nthat it excluded from evidence. On that record, the trial court found the alleged deadline\n\nuncommunicated and unenforceable, holding that \u201c[a]fter consideration of the evidence\n\nand considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The trial court further\n\nreasoned that \u201c[e]ven if for argument sake communication that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a time limit, contract formation still would have occurred through the action of\n\nthe parties.\u201d\n\nII.\n\nStandard of Review\n\nWhen an action is tried without a jury, an appellate court reviews both the law and\n\nthe evidence. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The trial court\u2019s factual findings \u2013 including findings\n\nbased on witness credibility, inferences from conduct, and the surrounding context of an\n\nalleged agreement \u2013 are reviewed for clear error. See Torboli v. Torboli, 127 Md. App.\n\f666, 672 (1999). The appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party, City of Bowie v. MIE Props., Inc., 398 Md. 657, 676 (2007) and resolves\n\nall evidentiary conflicts in the prevailing party\u2019s favor. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Steele\n\nSoftware Sys. Corp., 154 Md. App. 97, 107 n.1 (2003), cert. denied, 380 Md. 619 (2004);\n\nsee also Brault Graham, LLC v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., 211 Md. App. 638,\n\n659 (2013) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and\n\nreviews the trial court's legal conclusions de novo.\u201d). If there is any competent and material\n\nevidence to support the court\u2019s findings, those findings cannot be held clearly erroneous.\n\nL.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Md. Nat\u2019l Golf, L.P., 165 Md. App. 339, 343 (2005).\n\nIII.\n\nDiscussion\n\nI disagree with the Majority that Wife imposed a valid condition precedent to the\n\nformation of the Settlement Agreement through the Cover Letter. The parties agreed to\n\nsettle this case effective September 25, 2020, as evidenced by their notarized signatures on\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The terms and conditions of their settlement are reflected in\n\nthat agreement. Nowhere in the Settlement Agreement is there a timing provision on\n\nsigning the agreement or any reference to the Cover Letter. Moreover, the Cover Letter\n\nwas deemed hearsay by the trial court and was not admitted into evidence. At most,\n\nwhether Wife imposed a valid condition precedent presented a disputed factual question \u2013\n\nnamely, whether she clearly and effectively communicated a firm deadline for Husband to\n\nsign the agreement on September 25, 2020. The trial court answered that question in the\n\nnegative and its finding is well supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.\n\f A.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That There Was Mutual Assent\n For the Settlement Agreement Is Entitled to Deference\n\nThe trial court correctly found that the parties reached mutual assent to settle the\n\ncase effective September 25, 2020. After nearly three weeks of back-and-forth\n\nnegotiations and multiple drafts, Wife\u2019s counsel prepared the final agreement, which Wife\n\nsigned in two original copies, initialed on each page, and had notarized. Husband likewise\n\ntestified that he agreed to all the terms and conditions. The trial court found that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was fully integrated and effective under its express terms on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. There was no allegation of duress, fraud, or mistake. 1 Wife signed\n\nof her own volition, fully represented by counsel, and under no compulsion to execute the\n\ndocument. Husband did the same on Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nThe trial court concluded that the Settlement Agreement:\n\n[U]nambiguously, indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into\n a voluntary separation and property agreement on September 25th, 2020 to\n settle all matters of every kind and character arising from their marital\n relationship.\n\nAs a result, this Court finds that the threshold issue of whether mutual\n assent, the essential prerequisite to the creation or formation of a contract,\n has occurred.\n\nI find that the trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion are well-supported by the\n\nevidentiary record in this case.\n Wife alleged duress in her motion to set aside the Settlement Agreement, but did\nnot introduce any evidence of duress at the hearing, and ultimately withdrew the motion.\n\f The trial court further determined that because the parties\u2019 intent to form a contract\n\ncould be gleaned from the unambiguous language contained in the Settlement Agreement,\n\nconsideration of the Cover Letter was not appropriate because it was barred by the parol\n\nevidence rule. I agree with this ruling as well. See Calomiris v. Wood, 353 Md. 425, 361-\n\n62 (1999) (\u201cUnder the parol evidence rule, a written agreement \u2018discharges prior\n\nagreements,\u2019 thereby rendering legally inoperative communications and negotiations\n\nleading up to the written contract.\u201d) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\n\n213 (1979)).\n\nThere is ample competent evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding of a binding\n\ncontract: the fully executed, integrated, and notarized Settlement Agreement itself, Wife\u2019s\n\ndelivery of the signed originals, and Husband\u2019s express acceptance of its terms. The trial\n\ncourt credited this direct evidence in finding mutual assent \u2013 a finding we review only for\n\nclear error. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The Majority ignores the trial court\u2019s finding of mutual\n\nassent and its interpretation of the express terms of the Settlement Agreement. Instead, the\n\nMajority relies on an excluded post hoc hearsay document to conclude that Wife\u2019s\n\npurported \u201coffer\u201d had not been \u201caccepted\u201d and expired at midnight on September 25. As\n\ndiscussed below, I disagree with this approach because it rewrites the factual record,\n\ndisregards the trial court\u2019s firsthand credibility determinations, and relies on excluded\n\nhearsay to reach its conclusion.\n\f B.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Wife Did Not Impose\n A Valid Condition Precedent Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\nHaving determined that the fully executed, integrated Settlement Agreement was\n\nbinding and enforceable as of September 25, 2020, the trial court also evaluated whether\n\nWife\u2019s testimony \u2013 that she conditioned her offer on Husband\u2019s signing by that date \u2013 was\n\nsupported by the evidence. The trial court found that it was not, explaining: \u201cAfter\n\nconsideration of the evidence and considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find\n\nthat Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer included a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d\n\nBecause that factual finding is entitled to deference under Maryland Rule 8-131(c) unless\n\n\u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d see Mercy Medical Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare of the Mid-Atl.,\n\nInc., 149 Md. App. 336, 355 (2003), and because the record amply supports that finding,\n\nthe trial court ruling should be affirmed.\n\nThe reasons offered by the Majority to overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling are\n\nunpersuasive.\n\nFirst, the Cover Letter could not impose a valid condition precedent to formation of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The letter was drafted after Wife had already executed the\n\nSettlement Agreement, contains no reference to any signature deadline, and cannot\n\nretroactively alter a contract already formed as of September 25. A condition precedent by\n\ndefinition must exist at the moment of contract formation; it cannot be grafted on by a\n\nunilateral post-execution communication.\n\f Second, there is no evidence that any deadline was directly conveyed to Mr. Pattison\n\nprior to midnight on September 25, much less that he acknowledged or ratified such a\n\ndeadline. No one \u2013 neither Mr. Pattison, the attorneys, nor Ms. Pattison \u2013 testified that a\n\nSeptember 25, 2020 deadline was expressly conveyed to Mr. Pattison. Mr. Pattison\n\nacknowledged receiving and being familiar with the Cover Letter; but that does not\n\nestablish that he read or understood the letter as of the evening of September 25, or that he\n\nregarded it as imposing a binding deadline.\n\nMr. Pattison was asked directly whether he understood there to be \u201ca condition that\n\nyou sign the agreement and the note on September 25.\u201d He responded: \u201cThat\u2019s not\n\ncorrect.\u201d He elaborated:\n\nBecause the next sentence [of the Cover Letter] says, \u2018I will assume that we\n will have a final guaranty signed by Mr. Pattison by close of business on\n Monday.\u2019 My interpretation was [Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney] needed all the\n executed documents by Monday, because without the personal guaranty and\n the promissory note, the settlement agreement is unenforceable.\n\nMr. Pattison further testified that he understood there to be no deadline or expiration\n\ndate for his signature on the Settlement Agreement. He believed, based on his attorney\u2019s\n\ncommunications with Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney, that the parties had reached agreement on\n\nall terms as of Friday, September 25, 2020, and that he was obligated to sign the personal\n\nguaranty and promissory note in the days that followed. When asked if it was his position\n\nthat he could sign the settlement documents on Monday, September 28, when he provided\n\nthe final guaranty, Mr. Pattison answered: \u201cMy position has always been that.\u201d\n\nI disagree with the Majority opinion that Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was\n\nirrelevant. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was informed, at least\n\fin part, on his understanding that he and Wife had agreed to all outstanding issues effective\n\nSeptember 25 as evidenced by Wife\u2019s execution of the Settlement Agreement. With respect\n\nto the timing of his signature, Mr. Pattison understood that he could execute all of the\n\nsettlement documents on Monday, September 28. The trial court credited that testimony,\n\nand it provided a reasonable basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that there was no clear\n\ncondition precedent tied to the September 25 date.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s citation to Ray v. Eurice & Bros, Inc., 201 Md. 115 (1952) is\n\nmisplaced. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Ray and its progeny stand for the principle that a\n\nparty\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant when interpreting the terms of a contract that both\n\nparties signed. Here, it is undisputed that the Cover Letter was not incorporated into the\n\nSettlement Agreement, was not signed or agreed to by Husband (or perhaps timely seen),\n\nand, importantly, never admitted into evidence. Since the Cover Letter was not part of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Ray does not resolve whether that letter\u2019s terms \u2013 standing alone \u2013\n\ncreate a legally enforceable condition precedent. As the trial court correctly recognized,\n\nthey did not.\n\nThird, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as inadmissible hearsay and its\n\ncontents cannot be considered on appellate review as a basis for overturning the trial court\u2019s\n\nfactual findings. 2 Wife did not challenge that exclusion on appeal, so we should not\n The Majority\u2019s analytical variability on the trial court\u2019s findings below is\nunderscored by its effort to recast the Cover Letter as non-hearsay. See Majority Op. at 15\nn.4. The Majority argues that the Cover Letter was not offered for its truth, but rather \u201cfor\nthe legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter with\nsuch contents constituted an act with independent legal significance.\u201d But that effect\n\freconsider its exclusion now. See Md. Rule 8-131(a); Robinson v. State, 404 Md. 208, 217\n\n(2008). The fact that Wife\u2019s counsel read the contents of the Cover Letter to Husband and\n\nWife during questioning does not transform inadmissible material into admissible\n\nevidence. See cf. Clermont v. State, 348 Md. 419, 429 (1998) (defense counsel\u2019s statement\n\ndid not constitute as evidence and was properly struck from the record). It is manifestly\n\nunfair to strike down a contract based on a document the trial court neither admitted into\n\nevidence nor relied upon in its ruling. The Majority cites no case to the contrary.\n\nFourth, the Majority overlooks the fact that the Cover Letter was both legally and\n\npractically incapable of imposing a same-day deadline. Because the Settlement Agreement\n\ndid not include a counterpart clause, Mr. Pattison was not authorized to simply signed an\n\nemail copy of the agreement as the Majority suggests. Such a clause typically allows\n\ncontracts to be executed in \u201ccounterparts, and each counterpart will have the same force\n\nand effect as an original and will constitute an effective, binding agreement on the part of\n\neach of the undersigneds.\u201d See Alan S. Gutterman, Business Transactions Solutions \u00a7\n\nhinges on the recipient\u2019s timely awareness of \u201cWife\u2019s expression of the deadline\u201d \u2013 a\nfactual dispute the trial court resolved in Husband\u2019s favor. Indeed, the very case the\nMajority cites \u2013 Garner v. State, 414 Md. 372 (2010) \u2013 undermines the notion that it does\nnot matter if the offeree \u201cdid not learn about the offer until after it expired.\u201d Majority Op.\nat 15 n.4. In order to constitute non-hearsay, a \u201cverbal act\u201d must not only have independent\nlegal significance, but also is clearly communicated to the recipient to give it evidentiary\nsignificance. Garner, 414 Md. at 382 (\u201ccan I get a 40\u201d was a verbal act with legal\nsignificance and actually received by the listener). More fundamentally, the time to invoke\nthis argument has long passed. Unlike in Garner, where the hearsay issue was appealed,\nWife did not raise this argument before the trial court. Neither party challenged the\nexclusion of the Cover Letter on appeal, and both structured their proofs at trial\naccordingly. Waiver and failure to preserve preclude this Court from reversing the trial\ncourt\u2019s evidentiary ruling. The Majority cites no authority permitting it to revive and rely\non excluded hearsay at this stage \u2013 and I know of none.\n\f113:130 (Thomson Reuters 2010). These clauses are standard when parties are expected\n\nto sign at different times or locations. Indeed, the Cover Letter acknowledged that Ms.\n\nPattison had already signed both originals and instructed Mr. Pattison to \u201ccounter-execute\u201d\n\nthem \u2013 not sign an email copy. Thus, this instruction contemplated sequential, not\n\nsimultaneous, execution of the Settlement Agreement. 3\n\nSame-day counter-execution of the Settlement Agreement was also impractical. It\n\nis undisputed that Wife\u2019s counsel sent the executed originals late in the day on Friday,\n\nSeptember 25, to a law office he knew would be closed for the weekend. See Majority Op.\n\nat 13-14. Mr. Pattison, who was incapacitated on September 25 as a result of having Covid,\n\ndid not receive the originals until Monday, September 28. How, then, can the Cover Letter\n\nimpose a \u201cdefinite deadline\u201d requiring execution on September 25, when the documents\n\nwere physically inaccessible to Mr. Pattison until three days later? The Majority offers no\n\nanswer \u2013 only speculation that his counsel could have requested an extension. See Majority\n\nOp. at 15.\n\nFifth, the Majority disregards the trial judge\u2019s credibility determinations. After\n\nhearing testimony from both parties, the judge found that Ms. Pattison did not impose \u201ca\n\ndefinite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The Majority declares credibility\n This is further evidence that the Cover Letter was merely a timing provision that\nWife sought to impose after the fact. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, any temporal gap\nbetween the parties\u2019 respective signatures would reduce every mutually assented to\nagreement to a mere \u201coffer\u201d until the other party signed \u2013 an outcome squarely at odds with\nestablished principles of contract law.\n\f\u201cirrelevant\u201d and instead relies on counsel\u2019s scheduling emails \u2013 which were also excluded\n\nas hearsay \u2013 to conclude that Husband \u201cwas engaged in the settlement process on\n\nSeptember 25, notwithstanding his illness.\u201d Majority Op. at 14. Not only is this conclusion\n\ninconsistent with Mr. Pattison\u2019s testimony, 4 but it also ignores the trial court\u2019s role in\n\nresolving factual disputes.\n\nFinally, the Majority gives short shrift to the standard of review. The trial court,\n\nsitting as fact-finder, heard the evidence, evaluated credibility, and concluded that Wife\n\nfailed to prove the existence of a valid condition precedent. That conclusion was rooted in\n\nthe plain language of the Settlement Agreement, which established the effective date of the\n\nSettlement Agreement as of September 25 and which contained no deadline for Husband\u2019s\n\nsignature, and no express condition precedent. Viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to Husband as the prevailing party, and resolving all evidentiary conflicts in his\n\nfavor, we should affirm rather than second-guess the trial court\u2019s factual findings or fill\n\nevidentiary gaps with unwarranted inferences against him. See Knowles v. Binford, 268\n\nMd. 2, 11 (1972) (\u201c[T]he trial court is not only the judge of a witness\u2019 credibility, but is\n\nalso the judge of the weight to attach to the evidence[.]\u201d).\n\nIV.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to consider the context in which this dispute arose. On\n\nMarch 16, 2021, the trial court convened a two-day enforcement hearing on Husband\u2019s\n Mr. Pattison testified that he was ill with Covid on September 25, 2020, and slept\nmost of the day.\n\fmotion to enforce the Settlement Agreement he and Wife had negotiated and agreed to\n\nthrough counsel. In evidence before the court was the fully executed Settlement\n\nAgreement \u2013 signed, initialed, and notarized by both parties. The terms of the agreement\n\nwere clear and unambiguous.\n\nMs. Pattison seeks to transform an after-the-fact cover letter \u2013 excluded from\n\nevidence as hearsay \u2013 into a condition precedent to contract formation. She contends that\n\nthe agreement sent to Mr. Pattison on September 25, 2020, constituted a mere offer, subject\n\nto automatic withdrawal at midnight unless signed that same day. But this ignores that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was effective as of September 25 and there is no indication in the\n\nrecord that any such \u201ccondition\u201d was clearly communicated to Mr. Pattison. Notably,\n\nneither Ms. Pattison nor her attorney advised Mr. Pattison that the \u201coffer\u201d was withdrawn\n\nafter the supposed deadline passed. To the contrary, when Ms. Pattison received the\n\nexecuted agreement from Mr. Pattison on Monday, September 28, she raised no objections.\n\nIt was not until October 14 \u2013 seventeen days later, and two weeks after Mr. Pattison had\n\nbegun performing under the agreement \u2013 that Ms. Pattison first asserted that no contract\n\nhad been formed due to an unmet condition precedent. 5\n I agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that even assuming the Cover Letter imposed\na valid condition precedent, the record demonstrates that Wife waived that condition by\nher actions. Where an offeror \u201cwho does not in fact insist upon\u201d a time limit and continues\nnegotiations \u201cmay indicate a continued willingness to stand by the terms of its offer,\u201d\nthereby extending the acceptance period and effectively creating a new offer. Williston on\nContracts \u00a7 5:5.\n\f In reversing the trial court\u2019s enforcement of the Settlement Agreement, the Majority\n\nhas effectively announced a new rule of contract construction: a fully executed, integrated\n\nsettlement agreement \u2013 signed, notarized, and negotiated by counsel \u2013 may be set aside if\n\none party can point to any contemporaneous, extrinsic communication arguably\n\nconditioning its formation. That departs from Maryland\u2019s objective theory of contracts, as\n\narticulated in Ray, which holds that \u201c[t]he only intent of the parties to a contract which is\n\nessential, is an intent to say the words and do the acts which constitute their manifestation\n\nof assent,\u201d judged by what a reasonable person in the parties\u2019 position would have\n\nunderstood. Ray, 201 Md. at 127. Even if one party is mistaken, and even if that mistake\n\ncreates a hardship, a clearly expressed, integrated written contract may not be varied by\n\nparol evidence \u2013 absent fraud, duress, or mutual mistake. Id. at 125.\n\nHere, there are no allegations of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake \u2013 nor even a claim\n\nthat enforcement of the agreement would create any hardship. Ms. Pattison simply changed\n\nher mind \u2013 nineteen days after signing the Settlement Agreement \u2013 presumably because\n\nshe decided she wanted more money than what the agreement provided. She even later\n\ndescribed the Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms as \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nBy supplanting the objective inquiry (what does the contract say?) with a subjective\n\none (what do the extrinsic, unincorporated communications say?), the Majority undermines\n\nthe certainty that integrated contracts are meant to provide. 6 The Majority\u2019s opinion invites\n The Majority insists that this case \u201cis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about\n. . . offer and acceptance.\u201d Majority Op. at 15 n.4. Respectfully, that framing collapses\nunder the weight of the record. The trial court expressly found that the parties had already\n\flitigation over cover letters, emails, text messages, social media posts and other collateral\n\ndocuments or media a party may never have seen or agreed to \u2013 and renders enforcement\n\nof even signed, notarized, and fully integrated agreements uncertain.\n\nThe Majority opinion is even more problematic in the family law context, where\n\nemotions run high. By imposing strict black letter law as to offer and acceptance \u2013\n\nincorrectly, as it turns out here \u2013 the Majority opinion could significantly hamper the ability\n\nof judges to resolve these cases. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, a party who develops\n\nbuyer\u2019s remorse, or who for no reason at all wishes to return to the bargaining table without\n\nproviding a basis for doing so, need only append by email, or some separate writing, not\n\nagreed to or considered by the other party, a condition precedent that undercuts a carefully\n\ncrafted agreement that otherwise thoroughly and exclusively states the parties\u2019 mutual\n\nassent. With the Majority\u2019s view, where the record shows no disagreement by Ms. Pattison\n\nas to any term in the actual Settlement Agreement, the trial court\u2019s ability to make\n\ncredibility determinations, and most importantly, to resolve the case, has been effectively\n\nundercut. Ms. Pattison and other family law parties should not benefit from an incorrect\n\nformed a binding contract through mutual assent on September 25th \u2013 offer accepted. A\nmore apt analogy than the one posed by the Majority is where X and Y agree to the $200\ncar sale. Y signs a promissory note for $200, and X signs over title. Two hours later, X\nsends Y a text saying the sale is conditioned on my getting the $200 within the next 15\nminutes. Even where Y actually sees the text message (something that did not happen here\naccording to the trial court), this post hoc condition cannot retroactively alter the binding\nagreement already executed. It is exactly the Majority\u2019s elevation of the unilateral, post-\nexecution Cover Letter over the express and integrated terms of the Settlement Agreement\nthat is problematic, particularly here where the language of the Settlement Agreement\nprecludes precisely the kind of maneuver Wife has now effected with the Majority\u2019s\nendorsement.\n\fconstruct of contract law that prolongs the case by an unexpected condition precedent that\n\nwas wholly unreasonable under the circumstances. Gaming the resolution of family law\n\ncases in this manner benefits no one.\n\nThe trial court made no error in enforcing the Settlement Agreement based on the\n\nevidence before it, and the Majority identifies none \u2013 other than its argument that the\n\ninadmissible post-hoc Cover Letter was a valid condition precedent and is dispositive. The\n\nMajority offers no workable guidance to trial courts facing belated or collateral attacks on\n\nsettlement agreements. When does a \u201ccondition\u201d in a post-execution cover letter become\n\na valid condition precedent? Does mutual assent disappear simply because one party signs\n\nthe contract a few days after the other \u2013 particularly when sequential execution was\n\nanticipated? Does an integration clause preclude the enforcement of extrinsic terms that\n\ncontradict the agreement itself? And what role should trial courts play in enforcing written\n\nagreements when alleged conditions appear nowhere in the agreement and were never\n\nagreed to by the other party? I do not know the answers to these questions after reading\n\nthe Majority opinion. Instead, the Majority provides a roadmap for undoing signed\n\nsettlement agreements, undermining Maryland\u2019s strong public policy in favor of finality\n\nand resolution.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Majority opinion. Justice\n\nEaves has authorized me to state that she joins this dissent.\n\n18"

Answering only the question of liability, a jury found that Open\n\nfraudulently induced the City to enter the contract. The City elected to rescind\n\nthe contract, so the district court held a bench trial on restitution and ordered a\n\njudgment of almost $20 million against Open.\n\nOpen appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denials of its\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law. Because we find no error with the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s rulings or the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm. 2\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nIn February 2018, the City published a request for proposal (RFP) for a\n\nbilling software system for municipal utilities, including a new broadband\n\nutility called Connexion. On March 12, 2018, Open submitted a proposal for\n\nthe project based on its forthcoming software, Open SmartFlex Version 8. Open\n Except where the distinction matters, we refer to Open International and\nOpen Investments collectively as \u201cOpen.\u201d\n On February 19, 2025, Open moved for leave to file a supplemental\nappendix. We deny that motion.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 3\n\nclaimed that its product \u201ccomplie[d] with the vast majority of functional and\n\ntechnical requirements of th[e] RFP with one single and uniform product[.]\u201d\n\nSupp. App. vol. 4, at 1011 (emphasis omitted).\n\nThe RFP included a functional matrix that listed all the functional\n\nrequirements needed for the product and that directed bidders to complete the\n\nmatrix \u201caccurately and factually\u201d according to the provided grading rubric.\n\nSupp. App. vol. 8, at 2143. In its RFP response, Open graded about 90% of its\n\nhomegrown software\u2019s functionalities with \u201cA\u2019s,\u201d representing that the\n\nfunctionality was \u201cpart of [its software\u2019s] base system\u201d and that \u201c[n]o\n\n[m]odification [was] required.\u201d App. vol. 2, at 3.\n\nThe City selected Open International to be its vendor. And the parties\n\nformalized their contract with a Master Professional Services Agreement, in\n\nwhich Open Investments guaranteed Open International\u2019s performance under\n\nthe contract but made no contractual representations of its own. The contract\u2019s\n\nintroduction incorporates by reference the RFP and Open\u2019s proposal, which\n\nincludes the detailed functionality matrix for the services that Open\n\nInternational was to provide.\n\nThe project kicked off in late 2018 and suffered problems from the\n\nbeginning. One of the main sources of conflict was the customer self-service\n\nportal for the City\u2019s broadband-billing services. The service went live in\n\nAugust 2019 and had \u201ccritical functionality missing.\u201d App. vol. 7, at 68\u201369. In\n\nNovember 2019, the City cited the portal as one of its primary concerns, stating\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 4\n\nthat the \u201cportal testing hours [have been] extensive\u201d and that the \u201cpresented\n\nportal was different than what got delivered[.]\u201d App. vol. 9, at 26\u201327.\n\nDespite these problems, the City continued its contractual relationship\n\nwith Open International. Throughout the project, the parties negotiated and\n\nexecuted twenty-nine project change requests (PCRs), including PCR 19, which\n\naddressed issues relating to the customer portal. In a March 2020 memorandum,\n\nthe City\u2019s external project manager documented her concerns over problems\n\nwith Open International\u2019s product, but still recommended that the City preserve\n\nits relationship with Open International. And in June 2020, both parties agreed\n\nto a formal amendment that extended project milestones into 2021 and assigned\n\nmost of the added project costs to the City. The parties again agreed to extend\n\nthe project in December 2020.\n\nPrompted by this second amendment, the City hired a third-party\n\nconsultant to assess the project. In an April 2021 report, the consultant advised\n\nthe City to continue the project with Open International despite the project\n\ndelays and frustrations. Completing the project with Open International\n\nremained \u201cPlan A\u201d for the City. App. vol. 7, at 120\u201321. The parties jointly\n\nreviewed the functional matrix to evaluate whether the program was performing\n\nas Open had represented it would. But during the review in April and May\n\n2021, the City determined that Open\u2019s precontractual assertions about its\n\nsoftware\u2019s capabilities were false.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 5\n\nAlso during the review, Open International sent the City a notice of\n\ndefault stating that it could not proceed with its work unless and until the City\n\ncured certain deficiencies. From the City\u2019s view, that default notice \u201cwas a\n\nsignificant breach of trust.\u201d Id. at 123. Then on May 28, 2021, the City served\n\nits own notices\u2014a notice of dispute and notice of termination. In June, Open\n\nInternational provided a \u201cReset Proposal\u201d that acknowledged the results of the\n\nfunctional matrix audit\u2014which showed that only 17.3% of the \u201c[i]n scope\u201d\n\nrequirements had been accepted\u2014and sought additional funds to complete the\n\nproject. Supp. App. vol. 9, at 2473. But the proposal would not cure the issues\n\nwithin the thirty days required by the contract, so the City initiated this lawsuit\n\non July 2, 2021. The City also promptly retained a second vendor and began\n\nimplementing that product, and it stopped all use of Open International\u2019s\n\nproduct as soon as the new platform was available in December 2021.\n\nII. Procedural Background\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the City sued Open for breach of contract, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, and fraud-in-the-inducement. The City based its tort claims\n\non misrepresentations about (1) the timing for executing the project and the\n\nlevel of support Open International would provide, (2) Open International\u2019s\n\nsoftware being \u201cready for implementation,\u201d and (3) the fitness of Open\n\nInternational\u2019s software for the City\u2019s needs. App. vol. 3, at 60\u201361 \u00b6\u00b6 70\u201373.\n\nOpen pleaded affirmative defenses and asserted a counterclaim for breach of\n\ncontract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 6\n\nDuring discovery, the City learned that despite Open grading almost 90%\n\nof the required functionalities as an \u201cA\u201d in its March 2018 RFP response, Open\n\nhad internally assessed its software as meeting only 59.4% of the required\n\nfunctionalities. Open\u2019s internal assessment was dated in March 2018, before it\n\nresponded to the RFP. Also, the City learned that Open had not graded the\n\nprovided software\u2014a third-party portal called \u201cMilestone\u201d\u2014in the\n\nfunctionality matrix but had instead graded its \u201chomegrown\u201d software. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 254\u201355.\n\nOpen moved for summary judgment on the City\u2019s tort claims, arguing\n\nthat the claims were barred by the contract\u2019s merger clause and Colorado\u2019s\n\neconomic-loss rule, and that the City had waived the claims by repeatedly\n\naffirming the contract. The district court denied the motion. See City of Fort\n\nCollins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-MEH, 2023 WL 3585214,\n\nat *1, *13 (D. Colo. May 22, 2023). Open then asked the court to require the\n\nCity to elect a remedy before trial\u2014either affirming the contract and receiving\n\ndamages or rescinding the contract and receiving restitution. But the court\n\ndecided that the City would not have to select a remedy until the jury returned a\n\nverdict on the tort claims. City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-\n\nCV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2023 WL 11868279, at *2, *4 (D. Colo. Sept. 27, 2023).\n\nIf the City elected damages, the jury would be instructed on the breach-of-\n\ncontract claims and counterclaims; if the City elected rescission, the jury would\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 7\n\nbe dismissed, and the court would hold a bench trial on rescission and\n\nrestitution.\n\nThe trial started on October 23, 2023, and lasted ten days. At the close of\n\nevidence, Open moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the breach-of-contract claim and the tort claims.\n\nThe court denied the motion. Then the court gave the jury \u201call of the general\n\nclosing instructions,\u201d but only the fraud and negligent-misrepresentation\n\n\u201cclaim-specific instructions.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 58\u201359. For each of the tort claims,\n\nthe verdict form asked whether the City had proved the claim against \u201cOpen\u201d\n\nand whether \u201cOpen\u201d had proved waiver or expiration of the statute of\n\nlimitations. App. vol. 6, at 4\u20136. The district court instructed the jury to find\n\nwaiver if:\n\n1. The City learned the actual or true facts after it began the project\n with Open, but before it ceased the project with Open; and\n 2. The City continued the project with Open with full knowledge of\n the actual facts when a reasonable person under the same or similar\n circumstances would not have done so.\nApp. vol. 5, at 165. Open objected to the City\u2019s request that the instruction\n\nspecify, \u201cfull knowledge of all the actual facts,\u201d but it did not otherwise object\n\nto the waiver instruction. App. vol. 15, at 7 (emphasis added).\n\nThe jury determined that the City had proved fraudulent inducement and\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, but that the City had waived the negligent-\n\nmisrepresentation claim. The City elected to rescind the contract, so the court\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 8\n\ndismissed the jury. And because the City elected to rescind the contract, Open\u2019s\n\ncounterclaim for breach of contract disappeared.\n\nOpen timely renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nRule 50(b). And as part of its rescission brief, it also moved under Rule 52(c)\n\nfor partial judgment, arguing (1) that the City\u2019s evidence did not support a\n\nrestitution award and (2) that the City had waived rescission as a remedy. 3 The\n\ncourt denied the Rule 52(c) motion, City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No.\n\n1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *11\u201312 (D. Colo. Mar. 21,\n\n2024), and entered judgment against \u201cOpen\u201d for just under $20 million. Open\n\nagain moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and moved\n\nunder Rule 52(b) for amended or additional findings and Rules 59(a) and (e) for\n\namendment of the judgment or a new trial. The court orally denied those\n\nmotions and the earlier Rule 50(b) motion. Open timely appealed, and we have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 4\n The district court correctly noted that Rule 52 is reserved for nonjury\ntrials, but nonetheless addressed Open\u2019s arguments \u201cin the hopes of obviating\nthe need to address the[] matters in the future[.]\u201d City of Fort Collins v. Open\nInt\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *2\u20133 (D.\nColo. Mar. 21, 2024).\n The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\nOpen International and Open Investments are both Florida limited liability\ncompanies and their members are all Florida citizens. And Fort Collins is a city\nin Colorado, so it is a Colorado citizen. See App. vol. 3, at 47 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20135.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 9\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOpen presents four arguments on appeal: (1) that Colorado\u2019s economic-\n\nloss rule and the parties\u2019 contract bar the City\u2019s tort claims; (2) that insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of fraud; (3) that the City waived its\n\nability to rescind the contract; and (4) that Open Investments cannot be held\n\nliable for the rescission award.\n\nI. Tort Claims Not Barred\n\nFirst, Open asserts that the district court erred by denying its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, which argued that the City\u2019s tort claims were\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule and the parties\u2019 contract.\n\n\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d Fresquez v.\n\nBNSF Ry. Co., 52 F.4th 1280, 1295 (10th Cir. 2022). In reviewing the denial of\n\nsuch a motion, \u201cwe draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty,\u201d and we reverse \u201conly if the evidence points but one way and is\n\nsusceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the nonmovant.\u201d Id.\n\nA. Colorado\u2019s Economic-Loss Rule\n\n\u201cUnder the economic loss rule, a party suffering only economic loss from\n\nthe breach of an express or implied contractual duty may not assert a tort claim\n\nfor such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.\u201d Mid-\n\nCentury Ins. Co. v. HIVE Constr., Inc., 567 P.3d 153, 158 (Colo. 2025)\n\n(citation modified). Though it is termed the \u201ceconomic loss rule,\u201d a \u201cmore\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 10\n\naccurate designation . . . would be the \u2018independent duty rule\u2019\u201d because the\n\n\u201ckey to determining the availability of a contract or tort action lies in\n\ndetermining the source of the duty that forms the basis of the action.\u201d Town of\n\nAlma v. AZCO Constr., Inc., 10 P.3d 1256, 1262 & n.8 (Colo. 2000).\n\nTo determine whether a tort duty arises independent of a contract,\n\nColorado courts ask: \u201c(1) whether the relief sought in [tort] is the same as the\n\ncontractual relief; (2) whether there is a recognized common law duty of care in\n\n[tort]; and (3) whether the [tort] duty differs in any way from the contractual\n\nduty.\u201d 5 BRW, Inc. v. Dufficy & Sons, Inc., 99 P.3d 66, 74 (Colo. 2004). After\n\nexamining each factor, we conclude that the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by\n\nthe economic-loss rule.\n\nFirst, the City is seeking the same relief in tort that it is seeking under\n\nthe contract. In its complaint, the City sought rescission for both the tort and\n\ncontract claims, and alternatively sought damages for its contract claim. App.\n Though the Colorado Supreme Court has never held as much, dicta in\nColorado cases suggest that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not apply\nto intentional tort claims.\u201d Mid-Century Ins. Co., 567 P.3d at 156\u201357; see, e.g.,\nUnited Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1226 (10th\nCir. 2000) (\u201cIt is settled in Colorado that the economic loss rule applies only to\ntort claims based on negligence[.]\u201d); Bermel v. BlueRadios, Inc., 440 P.3d\n1150, 1153, 1154 n.6 (Colo. 2019) (observing that previous cases had applied\nthe economic-loss rule \u201cto bar only certain common law negligence claims\u201d and\nstating that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not be available to shield\nintentional tortfeasors from liability for misconduct that happens also to breach\na contractual obligation\u201d); Town of Alma, 10 P.3d at 1263 (citing Brody v.\nBock, 897 P.2d 769, 776 (Colo. 1995), a case that involved a common-law\nfraud claim, as an example of a common-law tort that is independent of a\nbreach-of-contract claim).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 11\n\nvol. 3, at 62 \u00b6 79 (rescission for tort claim), 64 \u00b6 89 (rescission for contract\n\nclaim, alternatively damages); see also id. at 47 \u00b6 2. So this factor supports\n\nOpen\u2019s view that the economic-loss rule bars the City\u2019s tort claims. See Dream\n\nFinders Homes LLC v. Weyerhaeuser NR Co., 506 P.3d 108, 121 (Colo. App.\n\n2021).\n\nSecond, because fraudulent inducement is a common-law tort claim,\n\n\u201cthere is a recognized common law duty of care in [tort.]\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74;\n\nsee also Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., 373 P.3d 603, 607 (Colo. 2016).\n\nSo this factor supports the City.\n\nThird, and most critically, \u201cthe [tort] duty differs . . . from the\n\ncontractual duty.\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74. Open claims that the parties\u2019 contract\n\n\u201cset[s] out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is based\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cthe grades Open assigned to thousands of software functionalities in its\n\nresponse to the City\u2019s RFP, and the City\u2019s claim that some of the delivered\n\nfunctionalities were inferior to those representations.\u201d Op. Br. at 25\u201326. So\n\nbecause the contract incorporated those grades and provided the requirements\n\nfor Open\u2019s software service, Open concludes that the contract subsumes the\n\nCity\u2019s fraud claim. We disagree.\n\nTorts based on precontractual conduct are often found to be independent\n\nof the contract. In re Bloom, 622 B.R. 366, 429 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2020)\n\n(collecting cases). For example, in Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., the\n\nColorado Supreme Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 12\n\nhad \u201cwrongfully induced him into entering a contractual relationship knowing\n\nthat it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised [services]\u201d\n\nestablished \u201ca violation of a tort duty that is independent of the contract.\u201d 373\n\nP.3d at 607. The court explained that \u201c[t]here is an important distinction\n\nbetween failure to perform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party\n\nto enter a contract in the first place.\u201d Id. It said that the \u201ccritical question\u201d was\n\nnot whether the tort claims were \u201crelated to the promises that eventually formed\n\nthe basis of the contract,\u201d but \u201cwhether the tort claims flow[ed] from an\n\nindependent duty under tort law.\u201d Id.; cf. Keller v. A.O. Smith Harvestore\n\nProds., Inc., 819 P.2d 69, 73 (Colo. 1991) (\u201c[C]laims of negligent\n\nmisrepresentation are based not on principles of contractual obligation but on\n\nprinciples of duty and reasonable conduct.\u201d).\n\nVan Rees is on point with our case. There, the parties contracted for web-\n\nrelated services and the development of new websites. 373 P.3d at 605. The\n\ncontract specified what services were to be provided and when. Id. Like our\n\ncase, the defendant \u201cmissed deadlines and failed to deliver the promised\n\nservices.\u201d Id. That was the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Id.\n\nBut during contract negotiations, the defendant allegedly \u201cknew that it lacked\n\nsufficient staff to complete the website on time, and did not intend to provide\n\nthe [full services],\u201d so it induced the plaintiff into a contractual relationship\n\n\u201cknowing that it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised\n\nweb-related services.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. Like our case, the defendant\u2019s\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 13\n\nmisrepresentation about its capabilities formed the basis for the tort claim. Id.\n\nat 607. And that claim was \u201can independent duty that did not arise from the\n\ncontracts,\u201d so it was \u201cnot barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. The\n\nsame is true here. 6\n\nNotwithstanding Van Rees, Open asserts that the City\u2019s claims are still\n\nbarred because the contract memorialized all precontractual representations,\n\nwhich means that the contract subsumed any tort duty. See BRW, 99 P.3d at 74\n\n(\u201cIf we conclude that the duty of care owed by [the defendants] was\n\nmemorialized in the contracts, it follows that the plaintiff has not shown any\n\nduty independent of the interrelated contracts[.]\u201d). But none of Open\u2019s cited\n\ncases involve precontractual representations. See id. at 75 (distinguishing its\n\nfacts\u2014a misrepresentation \u201cduring performance\u201d of the contract\u2014from cases\n\ninvolving misrepresentations \u201cprior to the execution of an agreement\u201d (citation\n\nmodified)); Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 123 (finding no independent duty\n Open criticizes Van Rees\u2019s distinction between a failure to perform the\ncontract and promises that induce a party to enter a contract. Reply Br. at 15\u2013\n16. It relies on HealthBanc Int\u2019l, LLC v. Synergy Worldwide, Inc., a Utah\nSupreme Court decision in which the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to\nadopt a blanket rule that fraudulent inducement is \u201cnecessarily independent of\nthe contract\u201d and instead held that a fraudulent-inducement claim that \u201coverlaps\ncompletely\u201d with a breach-of-contract claim is barred by the economic-loss\nrule. 435 P.3d 193, 196\u201397 (Utah 2018). The court criticized the Colorado\nSupreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Van Rees, calling its distinction between\nperformance and inducement \u201cillusory\u201d when \u201cthe subject matter of the\ninducing promises [is] later negotiated for and included in the contract.\u201d Id. at\n197. But whatever the merits of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning,\nHealthBanc is not binding here because the parties\u2019 contract is governed by\nColorado law, not Utah law. So Van Rees still controls.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 14\n\nbecause the relevant \u201cconduct occurred after the parties entered into the\n\ncontract\u201d). The closest Open gets is Smart v. Stropas, which involved a seller\u2019s\n\nprecontractual nondisclosure of latent defects in the home. No. 24CA0614,\n\n2025 WL 274726, at *2\u20133 (Colo. App. Jan. 23, 2025) (unpublished). There,\n\nthough the intermediate-appellate court found that the economic-loss rule\n\nbarred the home-buyer\u2019s fraudulent-nondisclosure claim, the contract\n\nprovisions exactly tracked the alleged tort duty. Id. at *3. The parties\u2019 contract\n\nboth (1) required the sellers to disclose any knowledge of methamphetamine\n\nbeing \u201cmanufactured, processed, cooked, disposed of, used or stored at the\n\nProperty\u201d and (2) represented that the sellers had no knowledge of such\n\nmethamphetamine use. Id. at *1. So the tort duty to disclose latent defects\n\n(here, the methamphetamine use) did not \u201cdiffer[] in any way from the\n\ncontractual duty\u201d to disclose methamphetamine use. Id. at *4 (citation\n\nmodified). \u201cBecause the contract explicitly addressed the sellers\u2019 obligation to\n\ndisclose methamphetamine,\u201d the tort duty was subsumed by the contract and\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule. Id. at *3.\n\nThe same is not true for our case; the parties\u2019 contract warranted only the\n\nquality of Open International\u2019s performance, not the accuracy of Open\u2019s\n\nrepresentations about its capabilities. Though Open claims that the parties\u2019\n\ncontract \u201cset out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is\n\nbased\u201d\u2014to deliver software functionalities consistent with the representations\n\nin the contract, Op. Br. at 25\u2014we agree with the City that Open conflates \u201cits\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 15\n\nultimate failures to provide and deliver the software functionalities in breach of\n\nits contractual obligations\u201d with its \u201cfraudulent representations about its\n\nsoftware which induced the City into\u201d the contract, Resp. Br. at 29\u201330. See Van\n\nRees, 373 P.3d at 607 (\u201cThere is an important distinction between failure to\n\nperform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party to enter into a\n\ncontract in the first place.\u201d); see also Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 120 (\u201cThe\n\neconomic loss rule does not apply to claims arising from a defendant\u2019s pre-\n\ncontractual conduct because, at that time, there was no contract that could have\n\nsubsumed identical tort duties.\u201d). Like the plaintiff in Van Rees, the City\u2019s \u201ctort\n\nclaims are based on misrepresentations made prior to the formation of the\n\ncontracts,\u201d which fraudulently induced it to enter the contract \u201cand therefore\n\nviolated an independent duty in tort to refrain from such conduct.\u201d 373 P.3d at\n\n607. So applying Van Rees, the third factor supports the City and finding that\n\n\u201cthe claims are not barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id.\n\nAs a final argument, Open claims that the economic-loss rule bars the\n\nCity\u2019s claims because the City is recovering a remedy that is expressly\n\nexcluded under the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 125\n\n(\u201cSophisticated commercial entities . . . may not circumvent the exclusion of\n\ndamages in their contracts by cloaking their claims in tort theories.\u201d). The\n\ncontract states that \u201cOpen\u2019s entire liability\u201d for breaching any of the warranties\n\n\u201cwill be for Open to correct or reperform any nonconforming [s]ervices[.]\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 7 \u00b6 2.1. And though the limitations-of-liability provision\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 16\n\ncontemplates damages and limits the type and amount of damages that can be\n\nrecovered, recovery of damages is limited to (1) indemnification claims,\n\n(2) intentional breaches of the confidentiality and personally-identifiable-\n\ninformation provisions, and (3) unauthorized use of Open\u2019s intellectual\n\nproperty. See id. at 12\u201313 \u00b6\u00b6 12.1\u201312.2. Yet the City sought rescission and\n\nalternatively damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nBut Open doesn\u2019t cite any Colorado Supreme Court case that supports\n\nthat this is a relevant consideration for determining whether a tort duty is\n\nindependent of a contract. And the cases that Open does cite all involve tort\n\nduties that were subsumed by the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at\n\n123\u201325 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cduty to not make misrepresentations\n\nor engage in fraud after they entered into the contract\u201d was \u201csubsumed within\n\nthe contract through the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d and then\n\nobserving that the claimants sought to recover \u201cthe very category of damages\u201d\n\nthat was barred by the contract); RE/MAX, LLC v. Quicken Loans Inc., 295 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 1163, 1170 (D. Colo. 2018) (\u201c[T]o the extent that Quicken Loans\n\nalleges misrepresentations by RE/MAX that are memorialized in the [contract],\n\nthe parties allocated risk with respect to those obligations by contract, and tort\n\nclaims based on those obligations are barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)). So though the City seeks to recover a type of relief that the\n\ncontract prohibits, the conduct warranting the relief is independent of, and\n\ntherefore not governed by, the contract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 17\n\nThus, under Colorado law, the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by the\n\neconomic-loss rule.\n\nB. Merger Clause and Other Provisions\n\nOpen also contends that the contract\u2019s merger clause and limited-\n\nwarranty provisions bar the City\u2019s tort claims.\n\nThough a merger clause \u201climit[s] future contractual disputes to issues . . .\n\nexpressly set forth in the executed document,\u201d misrepresentation claims \u201care\n\nbased not on principles of contractual obligation but on principles of duty and\n\nreasonable conduct.\u201d Keller, 819 P.2d at 72\u201373. So the \u201cmere presence of a\n\ngeneral integration clause in an agreement does not bar a claim for negligent or\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Id. at 73. Instead, to \u201ceffect a waiver of a claim\n\nof negligent [or fraudulent] misrepresentation,\u201d the merger clause must\n\n\u201cspecifically prohibit[]\u201d the claim. Id.\n\nOpen asserts that the contract\u2019s merger clause bars the City\u2019s tort claims\n\nbecause it \u201cwas quite specific with its integration of Open\u2019s RFP response into\n\nthe contract and the parties\u2019 disclaimer of extracontractual representations and\n\npromises.\u201d Op. Br. at 23. But the merger clause says nothing about precluding\n\nclaims for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation. See App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15. Though Open is correct that the clause covers the SOW and\n\nfunctionality matrix, the inclusion of those documents \u201cdoes not specifically\n\npreclude\u201d a fraud claim. Keller, 819 P.2d at 73. So the mere fact of a merger\n\nclause \u201cdoes not effect a waiver of [the tort] claim.\u201d Id. And unlike Steak n\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 18\n\nShake Enterprises, Inc. v. Globex Co., LLC, in which the court found that a\n\nmerger clause precluded a fraudulent-inducement claim because it disproved\n\nreliance \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d 110 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1083 (D. Colo. 2015), the\n\nmerger clause here says nothing about reliance. Compare App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15, with Steak n Shake, 110 F. Supp. 3d at 1083 (merger clause stating that\n\nthe \u201cFranchisees were entering into the agreement as a result of their own\n\ninvestigation and not as a result of any representation by Plaintiffs\u201d); see also\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 6 (contract introduction stating that \u201cthe City has proceeded\n\nwith reasonable reliance on Open\u2019s representations\u201d). So the merger clause\n\ndoes not bar the City\u2019s tort claim.\n\nOpen also asserts that the contract\u2019s limited-warranty provisions bar a\n\ntort claim because they \u201cexpressly disclaim[] reliance on precontractual\n\nrepresentations[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 24. Even if that were true (it\u2019s not), Open has\n\nwaived this argument by presenting it for the first time on appeal. 7 See\n Open claims it preserved this argument by \u201cma[king] a cogent and\ncomplete argument . . . discussing the complete and specific integration of the\nfunctionality matrix [and the] specific merger clause\u201d in its post-trial and\nsummary judgment motions, and that circuit precedent does not \u201crequire a\nlisting of every piece of evidence supporting an argument.\u201d Reply Br. at 17\u201318\n(citing Perez v. El Tequila, LLC, 847 F.3d 1247, 1256 (10th Cir. 2017)). But\nOpen misreads Perez. In Perez, we determined that the appellant had preserved\nits issues on appeal because the \u201cRule 50(a) motions contained identical\narguments\u201d as the Rule 50(b) motion. 847 F.3d at 1255\u201356 (emphasis added).\nThough the Rule 50(b) motion \u201cdid not rely upon the exact same facts\u201d as the\nearlier motions, we noted that such \u201ctechnical precision [was] unnecessary.\u201d Id.\n(emphasis added) (citation modified). But here, Open didn\u2019t simply fail to\ninclude certain facts\u2014it failed to include the argument itself.

Sufficient Evidence of Fraud\n\nSecond, Open asserts that we should reverse the jury\u2019s verdict because\n\n\u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence of an actual and actionable material\n\nmisrepresentation.\u201d Op. Br. at 21 (emphasis omitted).\n\n\u201cWhen a jury verdict is challenged on appeal, our review is limited to\n\ndetermining whether the record\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party\u2014contains substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nBangert Bros.

Co., 310 F.3d 1278, 1292 (10th\n\nCir. 2002) (citation modified). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something less than the\n\nweight of the evidence, and is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable\n\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if different\n\nconclusions also might be supported by the evidence.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nand (b) motions, Open argued only that \u201cthe economic loss rule and integration\nclause bar the City\u2019s fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims[.]\u201d App. vol.\n5, at 126 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (citation modified); see also App. vol. 6, at 151\n(Rule 50(b) Motion).

Because the parties and the district court focus on mainly the third\n\nmisrepresentation, and because we conclude that there is sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting that the third misrepresentation was fraudulent, we do not discuss\n\nthe other alleged misrepresentations.\n\nA. The Functionality Matrix\n\nThe City contends that \u201c[t]he most striking example of Open\u2019s false\n\nrepresentation was its fraudulent grading of its software in response to the\n\nCity\u2019s RFP in March 2018.\u201d Resp. Br. at 15. In Open\u2019s RFP response, Open\n\ngraded 89.7% of the required functionalities as \u201cA,\u201d or as already existing in\n\nthe current software system. But trial evidence showed that Open had internally\n\ngraded only 59.4% of its functionalities as the equivalent of an \u201cA.\u201d And\n\nbecause the internal grading was never disclosed to the City, the City claims\n\nthat Open\u2019s RFP response fraudulently represented its functionalities.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 21\n\nOpen claims that it accurately graded its functionalities based on the\n\nRFP\u2019s requirements. Below are the RFP\u2019s requirements for an \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d\n\ngrade:\n\nApp. vol. 2, at 3. Open asserts (1) that \u201cunrefuted trial testimony\u201d showed that\n\nOpen\u2019s grading was consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions and (2) that its\n\ninternal assessment cannot sustain the City\u2019s fraud claim because it \u201csorted the\n\nfunctionalities using different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a\n\ndifferent type of internal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39.\n\nAt trial, Open International\u2019s president explained that Open\u2019s grading\n\nwas consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions because the instructions asked about\n\nfunctionalities in Open International\u2019s base code, not functionalities in a\n\nreleased version of the software. App. vol. 12, at 184\u201385, 189\u201395. And because\n\nan \u201cA\u201d grade meant that the \u201c[d]esired functionality is achieved through\n\nconfiguration,\u201d even an \u201cA\u201d grade required some level of additional work. App.\n\nvol. 2, at 3; App. vol. 12, at 192\u201393; see also App. vol. 11, at 42 (the City\u2019s\n\nthird-party consultant testifying that \u201cconfiguration\u201d involves \u201cfive-plus\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 22\n\nthings\u201d). Open claims that the City\u2019s expert witness corroborated this testimony\n\nby agreeing that Open could grade a functionality as an \u201cA\u201d if that\n\nfunctionality was present in an earlier version of the software (but not the\n\nunreleased Version 8) so long as Open stated that the functionality was in an\n\nearlier version. See App. vol. 11, at 133\u201334. So Open concludes that the\n\nrepresentations were true and cannot support a finding of fraud.\n\nOpen also contends that its internal assessment \u201csorted the functionalities\n\nusing different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a different type of\n\ninternal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39. Below is a summary table of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment:\n\nApp. vol. 22, at 16. At trial, the City argued that the internal assessment\n\nshowed that only 59.4% of the functionalities (the \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d\n\ncategory) should have been given an \u201cA\u201d grade. But Open contends that its\n\ninternal assessment \u201cmerely broke down the RFP\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 grade into two\n\nsubcategories\u201d: \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d and \u201c[p]lanned for 2018.\u201d Reply Br.\n\nat 10. Open International\u2019s president testified that both categories had the\n\nrequired existing base code, but that the functionalities in the \u201c[c]urrent\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 23\n\nfunctionalities\u201d category were already integrated into Version 8 while the\n\nfunctionalities in the \u201c[p]lanned for 2018\u201d category would be integrated later in\n\n2018. App. vol. 12, at 191; see also id. at 194\u201395 (testifying that three of the\n\nfive categories corresponded with an \u201cA\u201d grade, one of the categories\n\ncorresponded with a \u201cB\u201d grade, and one of the categories corresponded with\n\nmultiple grades). Open acknowledges that the City \u201ctried to impeach\u201d its\n\nwitness on this subject but claims that \u201cnothing contradicted his testimony.\u201d\n\nOp. Br. at 40.\n\nBut Open\u2019s testimony was not unrefuted. On cross-examination, the City\n\nshowed the president\u2019s lack of knowledge about the internal document. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 29, 31. The president\u2019s deposition testimony differed from his\n\ntrial testimony, and the district court instructed the jury on inconsistent\n\nstatements after the jury asked for guidance. See id. at 261 (\u201cI heard a lot of in-\n\nperson testimony today that was inconsistent with recorded deposition. What\n\nare your instructions for us, the jury, how to deal with that?\u201d). It was the jury\u2019s\n\nrole to \u201cgive [the testimony] such credibility as [it] may think it deserves.\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 14, at 5. Also, the City presented evidence that \u201c[i]ndustry standard is\n\nto provide factual and accurate responses of [the vendor\u2019s] product or solution .\n\n. . at the time of response.\u201d App. vol. 11, at 84 (emphasis added). So we agree\n\nwith the district court that there was a \u201cdispute about what is A [grade] versus\n\nwhat [is] B [grade]\u201d and that it was \u201ccompletely a jury decision to conclude\n\nwhether [Open] was making those representations as to a current fact or a fact\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 24\n\nin effect at the time the product went live[.]\u201d Resp\u2019t Add. at 13. The jury made\n\nits decision and \u201c[w]e do not retry issues, second guess the jury\u2019s decision-\n\nmaking, or assess the credibility of witnesses and determine the weight to be\n\ngiven their testimony.\u201d Stroup v. United Airlines Inc., 26 F.4th 1147, 1157\n\n(10th Cir. 2022) (citation modified).\n\nOpen also asserts that the grades given to the various functionalities in\n\nthe functionality matrix are not actionable misrepresentations because the\n\nparties\u2019 contract stated that the criteria for the matrix and RFP response were\n\n\u201copen to interpretation\u201d and fraud claims cannot \u201crest on articulations of\n\nopinion or belief.\u201d Op. Br. at 38, 41. But Open did not present this argument in\n\nthe district court. See App. vol. 5, at 122\u201324 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (asserting\n\nthat the City had not proven a misrepresentation because \u201cthe functional matrix\n\ninstructions required those functionalities to be delivered at go-live,\u201d not at the\n\ntime Open submitted its RFP response); App. vol. 6, at 147\u201348 (Rule 50(b)\n\nMotion) (\u201cNothing in the RFP requested a vendor to grade its then-existing\n\nsoftware[.]\u201d). So it is waived. See Knowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183.\n\nGiven the conflicting testimony about Open\u2019s internal assessment and its\n\nRFP response, the jury had sufficient evidence to find that Open fraudulently\n\nrepresented its functionalities.\n\nB. Grading a Different Portal\n\nThe City also asserts that the jury could have found fraudulent\n\ninducement because of what Open graded. Despite allegedly knowing on March\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 25\n\n1, 2018, that it planned to stop developing its homegrown portal and instead\n\nuse the Milestone portal, Open still graded its homegrown portal for the RFP\n\nresponse. Open argues that this cannot support a fraud claim because the City\n\nadmitted at trial that it knew before signing the contract that Open International\n\nplanned to use the Milestone portal and because the City had described an early\n\ndemonstration of the portal as being \u201cexactly as expected when we selected\n\nOpen Smartflex.\u201d App. vol. 18, at 177; see also App. vol. 9, at 88\u201389; App. vol.\n\n12, at 196\u201397. Though the City knew that Open International was using the\n\nMilestone portal for the contract, Open International\u2019s president agreed at trial\n\nthat \u201c[n]o one at Open told the City [that Open] did not grade the Milestone\n\nportal in the RFP response[.]\u201d App. vol. 13, at 254\u201355. Again, because there\n\nwas conflicting testimony on this issue, we defer to the jury\u2019s finding. See\n\nKnowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183\u201384 (\u201c[T]he jury has the exclusive function of . . .\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, and reaching ultimate conclusions of\n\nfact[.]\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict finding Open liable\n\nfor fraudulent inducement.\n\nIII. Ability to Rescind\n\nThird, Open asserts that because the City knew of multiple problems with\n\nthe software and its implementation by spring 2020, yet continued to affirm the\n\ncontract, the City waived its right to rescind the contract.\n\n\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable time, but what\n\nconstitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a particular case and\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 26\n\nmust be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d Ralston Oil & Gas Co. v. July Corp.,\n\n719 P.2d 334, 340 (Colo. App. 1985). We review \u201cfindings of fact for clear\n\nerror.\u201d Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 826 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nA \u201cfinding of fact is not clearly erroneous unless it is without factual support in\n\nthe record, or if the appellate court, after reviewing all the evidence, is left with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Mile High\n\nIndus. v. Cohen, 222 F.3d 845, 854 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation modified).\n\nA. The Waiver Rule\n\nThe district court instructed the jury to find that Open proved \u201cthe\n\naffirmative defense of waiver\u201d if the City \u201ccontinued the project with Open\n\nwith full knowledge of the actual facts when a reasonable person under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances would not have done so.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 166.\n\nThat instruction is based on Elk River Associates v. Huskin, in which a\n\nColorado appellate court explained that \u201c[t]o sustain the defense of ratification\n\nand waiver, it must appear that the defrauded party, with full knowledge of the\n\ntruth respecting the false representations, elected to continue to carry out the\n\nagreement.\u201d 691 P.2d 1148, 1153 (Colo. App. 1984).\n\nBut Open contends that \u201cthe \u2018full knowledge\u2019 requirement comes into\n\nplay only if one elects to affirm the agreement and thereafter continues to carry\n\nit out and receive its benefits, which would then result in a remedy of damages,\n\nnot rescission.\u201d Op. Br. at 36 (citation modified). Open asserts that to waive\n\nrescission, \u201c[i]t is not requisite that the defrauded party shall be acquainted\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 27\n\nwith all the evidence constituting the fraud[.]\u201d Id. at 35 (quoting Gladden v.\n\nGuyer, 426 P.2d 953, 955 (Colo. 1967)). Instead, rescission is waived once a\n\nparty \u201chas evidence sufficient to reasonably actuate him to rescind the\n\ncontract[.]\u201d Id. (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955). So Open concludes that the\n\njury decided only whether the City had waived its ability to recover damages\n\nfor Open\u2019s fraud, not whether the City had waived its ability to rescind the\n\ncontract. 8\n\nWe disagree. As the district court correctly stated, \u201cColorado courts do\n\nnot treat fraudulent inducement waiver and recission waiver as separate claims,\n\ngoverned by different tests[.]\u201d Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *4;\n\naccord Gerbaz v. Hulsey, 288 P.2d 357, 363 (Colo. 1955) (\u201cIf [it] was actually\n\nthe fact [that the plaintiff misrepresented the contract] then defendant was in a\n\nposition to elect, when he discovered the fact, either to rescind the contract, or\n\nto sue for damages[.]\u201d (emphasis added)); Bankers Tr. Co. v. Int\u2019l Tr. Co., 113\n\nP.2d 656, 664 (Colo. 1941) (\u201c[T]he right to rescind and sue [is] waived\u201d if \u201cthe\n\ndefrauded party, with full knowledge, intentionally condoned the fraud,\n\naffirmed the contract and abandoned all right to recover damages.\u201d). A party\n\nwaives the right to rescind when it has full knowledge of the material fact of\n Open\u2019s argument in the district court was a little different. Rather than\nseparating the waiver rules based on two types of remedies (damages and\nrescission), it separated the waiver rules based on whether the plaintiff was\npursuing a claim or seeking a remedy. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934,\nat *3.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 28\n\nthe fraud, even if it does not know all the underlying details of the fraud. See\n\nTisdel v. Cent. Sav. Bank & Tr. Co., 6 P.2d 912, 917 (Colo. 1931) (finding\n\nwaiver because the defendant had \u201cfull knowledge of the falsity of the\n\nrepresentations, and [] all the material facts respecting the same well in mind\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)); Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955 (\u201cThe duty of rescinding arises\n\nimmediately upon acquiring knowledge of the substantial and material facts\n\nconstituting the fraud\u201d and \u201cno subsequent discovery of cumulative evidence\n\ncan operate to execute waiver of the fraud if one has in the meantime occurred,\n\nor to revise a once lost right of rescission.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation\n\nmodified)); see also In re Mascio, 454 B.R. 146, 151 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2011)\n\n(defining \u201cfull knowledge\u201d as \u201cthe substantial and material facts constituting\n\nthe fraud\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955)). So a party\n\nneed not elect rescission until \u201che becomes aware of facts or circumstances that\n\nentitle him to a rescission.\u201d Young v. Leech, 240 P. 692, 693 (Colo. 1925); see\n\nGerbaz, 288 P.2d at 363 (\u201c[T]he[] defendant was in a position to elect[] when\n\nhe discovered the fact[.]\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\nOpen claims that it makes sense to have separate waiver rules for\n\nrescission and claims for damages because it \u201cprevent[s] a party from waiting\n\nto see how their contract plays out before deciding whether to rescind or sue for\n\ndamages.\u201d Reply Br. at 19\u201320. But Open never explains why \u201cwaiting to see\n\nhow the[] contract plays out\u201d before suing for damages should be treated\n\ndifferently than \u201cwaiting to see how the[] contract plays out\u201d before rescinding.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 29\n\nId. Indeed, the point of waiver is to prevent the \u201cwaiting to see how the[]\n\ncontract plays out\u201d part. See Stoner v. Marshall, 358 P.2d 1021, 1023 (Colo.\n\n1961) (\u201c[The] election [of rescission or damages] must be promptly made . . .\n\notherwise one might, with knowledge of fraud, speculate upon the advantages\n\nor disadvantages of an agreement, receive its benefits, and thereafter repudiate\n\nall its obligations.\u201d (citation modified)). Though Open is correct that many\n\ncases the City and the district court cite involve claims for damages instead of\n\nrescission, it has not persuasively explained why that matters. Regardless of the\n\nremedy, the question is whether the party waived its right to recovery by acting\n\nlike everything was okay under the contract and then turning around and\n\nseeking recovery for the very conduct it chose to ignore.\n\nSo the district court properly instructed the jury on waiver, and we now\n\nconsider whether the finding that the City did not waive its right to rescind the\n\ncontract was clearly erroneous.\n\nB. No Waiver\n\nThe jury found that the City did not waive its right to recover for Open\u2019s\n\nfraudulent inducement. And the district court accepted that factual finding. See\n\nOpen Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *3\u20134. Because this finding has factual\n\nsupport in the record, it was not clearly erroneous. See Cohen, 222 F.3d at 854;\n\ncf. Ralston Oil & Gas Co., 719 P.2d at 340 (holding that the trial court\u2019s\n\nconclusion \u201cthat plaintiff did not unreasonably delay seeking rescission of the\n\ncontract\u201d was \u201camply supported by the record\u201d).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 30\n\nOpen contends that the City knew these facts by spring 2020: (1) that the\n\nsoftware was untested and had not been installed for any other customer,\n\n(2) that the customer portal was not satisfactory and was not the portal\n\nrepresented during the vendor-selection process, (3) that the software\u2019s\n\nfunctionalities were only 58% of the required functionalities, and (4) that there\n\nwere significant issues with Open International\u2019s product. And Open asserts\n\nthat despite this knowledge, the City agreed to PCR 19, which was meant to\n\naddress the issues with the software and deliver complete functionality, and\n\nthus affirmed the contract and waived rescission.\n\nBut Open continues to conflate the problems with its software with its\n\nfraudulent precontractual representations; knowledge of these problems is not\n\nthe same as knowledge of fraud. Though the jury could have inferred\n\nknowledge of fraud based on knowledge of the above facts, it was not required\n\nto do so. The City\u2019s CFO testified that realizing Open\u2019s misrepresentations\n\n\u201cwas a gradual process\u201d and that the \u201cfunctional matrix work was the point in\n\ntime where [the CFO] said I think we may have gotten swindled.\u201d App. vol. 7,\n\nat 108. And there was evidence that the City did not learn of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment of the functionality matrix until discovery. See App. vol. 13, at\n\n254\u201355. So there was at least conflicting evidence about when the City\n\ndiscovered the fraud.\n\nOpen criticizes the City\u2019s CFO\u2019s testimony as \u201cconclusory, self-serving,\n\nand self-contradictory[.]\u201d Reply Br. at 21. But it was the jury\u2019s role to assess\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 31\n\nthe witnesses\u2019 credibility and weigh the evidence. See Bankers Trust Co., 113\n\nP.2d at 664 (\u201c[Q]uestions as to the time when plaintiff first discovered the\n\nfraud . . . are questions of fact for resolution by a jury.\u201d); Ralston Oil & Gas\n\nCo., 719 P.2d at 340 (\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable\n\ntime, but what constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a\n\nparticular case and must be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d).

Open Investments\u2019 Liability\n\nFinally, Open challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion that argued that Open Investments could not be liable for rescission (a\n\ntort remedy) because it was only a guarantor of the contract and thus liable only\n\nfor contract damages. Alternatively, it argued that even if Open Investments\n\ncould be liable for rescission, there was insufficient evidence that Open\n\nInvestments made a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. 9 But we agree\n Open complains that the City \u201ceschewed\u201d its burden to prove each\ndefendant\u2019s liability \u201cby sleight-of-hand, using \u2018Open\u2019 as a trial shorthand to\nrefer to both defendants collectively.\u201d Op. Br. at 42. But in the district court,\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 32\n\nwith the district court that Open has long waived this argument. See Open Int\u2019l,\n\nLLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *5 (\u201c[T]his argument disclaiming any liability of\n\nOpen Investments comes far too late.\u201d).\n\nOpen argued for the first time in its Rule 50(b) motion, one month after\n\nthe jury had been dismissed, that Open Investments could not be held liable for\n\nthe rescission remedy. See App. vol. 17, at 176 (Q: \u201cPrior to your Rule 50[b]\n\nmotion, had this issue ever been brought up?\u201d A: \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t think it\n\nwas brought up until the election of remedies[.]\u201d). Because Open failed to make\n\nthis argument in its Rule 50(a) motion, and because the City objected to this\n\nnew argument, the issue is waived and we will not consider it on appeal. 10 See\n\nall parties consistently referred to Open International and Open Investments\ncollectively as \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cDefendants.\u201d See e.g., Supp. App. vol. 1, at 50\u201385\n(Open\u2019s Partial Motion for Summ. J.); App. vol. 2, at 184\u2013224 (Final Pretrial\nOrder); App. vol. 4, at 1\u20132 (Open\u2019s Motion to Compel Election of Remedies);\nApp. vol. 5, at 118\u201340 (Open\u2019s Rule 50(a) Motion); App. vol. 7, at 25 (Open\u2019s\nOpening Statement) (\u201cNow, who is Open? Open is not just one company, as the\njudge mentioned.\u201d). And Open never objected to the jury instructions or to the\nverdict form that referred to \u201cOpen\u201d collectively.\n Open asserts three reasons why its argument would not be waived.\nFirst, it repeats its earlier argument that \u201ctechnical precision [between Rule\n50(a) and Rule 50(b) motions] is unnecessary[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 43 (quoting Perez,\n847 F.3d at 1256). We reject that argument for the same reason we rejected it\nabove\u2014Open failed to make the argument in its motion. See Perez, 847 F.3d at\n1255\u201356. Second, Open claims that its argument is not waived under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 46, which provides that \u201c[f]ailing to object does not\nprejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was\nmade.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 46. But Open doesn\u2019t assert that it had no opportunity to\nobject; it asserts that \u201cthere was no reason for Open Investments to object[.]\u201d\nOp. Br. at 47 (emphasis added). So Rule 46 does not save Open\u2019s argument.\nThird, Open contends that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(5) preserves\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 33\n\nTherrien v. Target Corp., 617 F.3d 1242, 1250 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010)\n\n(\u201cOrdinarily a party cannot raise in a Rule 50(b) motion an argument not\n\nalready raised in its Rule 50(a) motion. But on appeal we can consider such an\n\nargument when the opposing party failed to object to the Rule 50(b) motion for\n\nraising new arguments.\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the district court\u2019s\n\ndenial of Open\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion on this issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denial of Open\u2019s\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nits claim. But Rule 52(a)(5)\u2019s directive that \u201c[a] party may later question the\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the [court\u2019s] findings, whether or not the\nparty . . . objected to them\u201d is reserved for nonjury trials. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a)(1) (\u201cIn General. In an action tried on the facts without a jury . . . the\ncourt must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law\nseparately.\u201d); see also Johnson v. Raemisch, 779 F. App\u2019x 507, 518 n.10 (10th\nCir. 2019) (\u201cRule 52 governs bench trials[.]\u201d). Though the restitution amount\nwas decided by the court, the issue Open challenges here\u2014its liability\u2014was\ntried before a jury. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *1\u20132. So Rule\n52 offers Open no help either. Open waived its argument.\n\n33"

The Older Americans\nAct (OAA) establishes funding mechanisms and an adminis-\ntrative framework to help states provide healthcare, housing,\nand community services for older persons. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001 et\nseq. States must jump through several hoops before securing\nOAA funding, including submitting a state plan, designating\n\f2 No. 23-2788\n\na state agency, and geographically dividing the state into dis-\ntinct planning and service areas. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027; 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(1). Then, for each service area, states must designate\na \u201cpublic or private nonprofit \u2026 as the area agency.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(2). At the heart of this case is whether those \u201carea\nagencies\u201d can sue to enforce OAA provisions and related Illi-\nnois state laws.\n One such area agency, the Northwestern Illinois Area\nAgency on Aging (NIAAA), filed state and federal suits\nagainst Paula Basta, the former Director of the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA). NIAAA\u2019s lawsuits alleged that Basta,\nin her personal and official capacities, deprived it and others\nof rights guaranteed by Illinois law and the OAA. Specifically,\nthe lawsuits alleged that Basta unlawfully refused to hold\nhearings on three administrative petitions that NIAAA filed.\n Ultimately, NIAAA lost both suits. The Illinois Supreme\nCourt first ruled in Basta\u2019s favor. Then, the federal district\ncourt dismissed NIAAA\u2019s suit on the grounds that it was\ntime-barred and failed to state a claim. After requesting entry\nof a final judgment, NIAAA brought this appeal raising a host\nof issues.\n We find no error and affirm across the board.\n\nI\n\nWe begin with the facts. At the pleadings stage, we accept\nall well-pled facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw\nall reasonable inferences in NIAAA's favor. Gociman v. Loyola\nUniv. of Chicago, 41 F.4th 873, 878 (7th Cir. 2022).\n\fNo. 23-2788 3\n\nA. Administrative Background\n\nAs noted above, the Older Americans Act (OAA) requires\nstates to take certain steps to designate area agencies respon-\nsible for providing services to senior citizens. Should states\nfail to comply with those requirements, the federal govern-\nment can take remedial measures, such as terminating fund-\ning. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027(d). Area agencies, in turn, serve\nas the \u201cpublic advocate[s] for the development or enhance-\nment of comprehensive and coordinated community-based\nsystems of services in each community throughout and spe-\ncific to each planning and service area.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1321.61(a);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3025(b)(5). Area agencies must develop a\nplan to provide services within their designated area and then\nsubmit that plan to state authorities. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3026(a).\n The Illinois Act on Aging designates the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA) as the \u201csingle State agency for receiving\nand disbursing federal funds made available under the \u2018Older\nAmericans Act.\u2019\u201d 20 ILCS 105/4. The IDA is responsible for\ncomplying with the OAA\u2019s provisions and \u201c[a]ssisting area\nagencies on aging in the development of comprehensive and\ncoordinated service delivery systems throughout the State.\u201d\n89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.10(a)(4). NIAAA is one such agency,\nwhich the IDA assigned to cover the state\u2019s nine northwest-\nernmost counties. Although an independent nonprofit,\nNIAAA receives more than ninety percent of its funding from\nthe IDA.\n Previously, Illinois regulations required the IDA to pro-\nvide agencies like NIAAA an opportunity for a hearing when\nthe IDA \u201cpropose[d] to disapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan \u2026 or withdraw from the agency\n\f4 No. 23-2788\n\ndesignation as an [area agency],\u201d when \u201cany eligible appli-\ncant for designation as a planning and service area under the\nprovisions of [the Act]\u201d has been denied, or for \u201cany nutrition\nproject that an area agency proposes to defund.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 215 N.E.3d 935, 948 (Ill. 2022) (citing 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n\u00a7 230.410 amended at 5 Ill. Reg. 3722 (eff. Mar. 31, 1981), re-\nnumbered at 7 Ill. Reg. 5178 (eff. July 27, 1983)). That regula-\ntion was amended effective August 2021. Under the amend-\nment, a hearing is to be provided to an area agency when the\nIDA proposes to: \u201c(A) [d]isapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan that has been submitted to the\n[IDA] by the [area agency]; or (B) [r]eject the [area agency\u2019s]\nrecommendation to designate a service provider.\u201d 89 Ill. Ad-\nmin. Code \u00a7 230.450(a)(1) (\u201c2021 Hearing Rule\u201d). The IDA\nalso has the right to \u201cconduct administrative hearings for\nother appeal requests concerning the health, safety and wel-\nfare of older individuals.\u201d 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.450(b).\n\nB. The Underlying Disputes\n\nIn June 2019, NIAAA requested an administrative hearing\n(\u201cInitial Petition\u201d) with the IDA. The petition presented two\ngrievances and requested findings that the IDA violated the\nIllinois Administrative Procedure Act, 5 ILCS 100/1\u20131 et seq.,\nby withholding funds from it, and that the Department also\nviolated Illinois law.\n The first grievance NIAAA aired in its Initial Petition\nstemmed from the fallout that occurred when NIAAA de-\ncided that the IDA\u2019s Adult Protective Services (APS) Manual\nwas invalid and ought to be recalled. In July 2013, NIAAA\nreached out to the IDA\u2019s then-director, John Holton, raising\nconcerns about the manual. Months later, Holton sent\n\fNo. 23-2788 5\n\nNIAAA a letter advising that the IDA was terminating\nNIAAA\u2019s FY2014 Adult Protective Services (APS) Grant, ef-\nfective January 2014. Fast forward to 2019. In April of that\nyear, the petition alleged, NIAAA\u2019s director and general\ncounsel, Grant Nyhammer, was told by an IDA employee that\nthe employee had been \u201cgiven an order [to] withhold funding\nfrom [NIAAA] to retaliate for [its] advocacy.\u201d Later that\nmonth, as outlined in the petition, Nyhammer asked Basta via\nemail to \u201cinvestigate funding being withheld\u201d from NIAAA.\nBasta responded that she could not speak to practices preced-\ning her tenure as director.\n From this emerged the second grievance NIAAA pre-\nsented in the Initial Petition\u2014that the IDA had refused\nNIAAA\u2019s administrative hearing request. The IDA denied the\nInitial Petition because it did not present a \u201ccontested case\u201d as\ndefined in the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act and\ntherefore did not require a hearing.\n Two months after submitting the Initial Petition, NIAAA\nsubmitted a second petition (\u201cAPS Petition\u201d) in August 2019.\nThe APS Petition raised grievances about events after the fil-\ning of the Initial Petition. This second petition requested a\nhearing and alleged that the IDA had improperly rejected\nNIAAA\u2019s designation of APS providers. As background, two\nmonths earlier, in June, NIAAA had designated APS provid-\ners for its service agency. The next month, the IDA responded\nthat the IDA was \u201cexercising its right to reject the [provider]\nrecommendations\u201d because of \u201cvarious deficiencies in the un-\nderlying [r]equest.\u201d NIAAA\u2019s APS Petition followed, which\nthe IDA denied by letter in September 2019. The letter in-\nformed NIAAA that the IDA \u201cis unable to provide a hearing\n\f6 No. 23-2788\n\nbecause the [APS Petition] fails to present a contested case\nthat would support the right to an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d\n Two years after its first two petitions were denied, NIAAA\nsubmitted a third petition (\u201cState Plan Appeal\u201d). This peti-\ntion, sent in September 2021, alleged that the IDA\u2019s state plan\nfor 2022\u20132024 did not comply with the OAA\u2019s regulations.\nLike the first two petitions, the third petition requested an ad-\nministrative hearing. In December 2021, the IDA responded\nwith a letter dismissing the petition because 89 Ill. Adm. Code\n230.420(d) only permitted area agency appeals in two limited\nand inapplicable circumstances.\n\nC. Court Proceedings\n\nOn November 5, 2019, NIAAA filed a complaint for man-\ndamus in Winnebago County Circuit Court. The state trial\ncourt denied relief, but the state appellate court reversed with\ninstructions for the IDA to conduct hearings on both the Ini-\ntial Petition and APS Petition. In its order remanding the mat-\nter, the appellate court concluded that the IDA\u2019s \u201csummary\ndismissals of [NIAAA\u2019s] petitions and its conclusory state-\nments that the petitions failed to present contested cases were\ninsufficient for meaningful judicial review.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 188 N.E.3d 1283, 1290 (Ill. App. Ct. 2022). The appellate\ncourt also held that the IDA was \u201crequired to give [NIAAA]\nadjudicatory hearings and determine the merits of its peti-\ntions.\u201d Id. at 1292. The case then made its way to the Illinois\nSupreme Court which disagreed with the state appellate court\nand, instead, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing\nthe mandamus complaint. Nyhammer v. Basta, 215 N.E.3d 935\n(Ill. 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 2497 (2023).\n\fNo. 23-2788 7\n\nHaving lost its administrative and state court challenges,\nNIAAA proceeded to federal court. On February 28, 2022,\nNIAAA filed a complaint against Paula Basta in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois. NIAAA pleaded ten causes of action\nagainst Basta in its First Amended Complaint: five in her per-\nsonal capacity (Counts I\u2013V) and five in her official capacity\n(Counts VI\u2013X). The allegations at issue in this appeal are as\nfollows:\n Count I: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s hearing rights under the\n OAA;\n Count II: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s right to function as a public\n advocate as defined by the OAA;\n Count III: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n Initial Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count IV: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n APS Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count V: the IDA\u2019s regulation on hearings (as\n amended and codified under 89 Ill. Admin.\n Code \u00a7 230.410, which the parties refer to as the\n \u201cHearing Rule\u201d) denies NIAAA its right to a\n hearing under the OAA and thereby deprives\n NIAAA of due process.\nCounts I\u2013V were brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Counts VI\u2013\nX involved pendant state law claims. NIAAA sought dam-\nages in excess of $75,000, attorneys\u2019 fees, and declaratory\njudgments that (1) Basta unlawfully failed to provide\n\f8 No. 23-2788\n\nhearings on NIAAA\u2019s three petitions, (2) Basta violated due\nprocess, OAA, and state law rights, and (3) the Hearing Rule\nis invalid under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.\n In response, Basta filed a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). That motion\nalleged that NIAAA had not shown: (A) \u201cany property right\nin an administrative hearing pursuant to due process [or] the\nOlder Americans Act\u201d; (B) a clearly established right that had\nbeen violated to defeat qualified immunity to bar Counts I\u2013V;\n(C) why sovereign immunity would not bar Counts VI\u2013X; (D)\nwhy the statute of limitations would not bar Counts III and\nIV; (E) what standing NIAAA has to bring Counts VII\u2013VIII on\nbehalf of older adults and organizations. After full briefing on\nthat motion, the district court entered an order dismissing\nNIAAA\u2019s complaint without prejudice. The order invited\nNIAAA to file an amended complaint, but NIAAA instead\nfiled a motion for entry of a final judgment. The district court\ngranted that motion, and this appeal followed.\n\nII\n\nWith those facts established, we turn to NIAAA\u2019s chal-\nlenge to the district court order granting the motion to dis-\nmiss. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim. Gociman, 41 F.4th at 881. And we may affirm a dismis-\nsal on any basis supported by the record. Thomas v. Dart, 39\nF.4th 835, 840 (7th Cir. 2022).\n Recall, the district court dismissed all of NIAAA\u2019s federal\nclaims (Counts I\u2013V) for three reasons: (1) the statute of limita-\ntions barred claims arising from the IDA\u2019s denials of\nNIAAA\u2019s Initial Petition and APS Petition; (2) NIAAA lacked\n\fNo. 23-2788 9\n\nany property interest deprived by the IDA without due pro-\ncess; and (3) the OAA provisions at issue did not clearly man-\nifest an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights en-\nforceable by NIAAA via \u00a7 1983. On appeal, NIAAA chal-\nlenges all three reasons. We review each in turn.\n\nA. Statute of Limitations\n\nAs a threshold matter, NIAAA argues that the district\ncourt improperly considered the statute of limitations when\nruling on Basta\u2019s motion to dismiss. Specifically, NIAAA\nclaims that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense\nand therefore must be raised in an answer, not a motion to\ndismiss. That is incorrect. In Talevski ex rel. Talevski, our court\ndid indeed caution that \u201cthe proper way to raise a limitations\ndefense is in the answer, as an affirmative defense.\u201d Talevski\nex rel. Talevski v. Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty., 6 F.4th\n713, 721 (7th Cir. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Health & Hosp. Corp. of\nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023) (emphasis added)\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). But in that very case, we also\nacknowledged two other ways that the defense can be raised:\n(1) in a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(c); or (2) in a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in the rare circumstance where \u201cthe\ncomplaint alone alleges enough facts to eliminate all doubt\nabout timeliness.\u201d Id. Here, there was no factual dispute as to\ntimeliness, only a legal one. The parties do not dispute when\nthe underlying facts occurred, and the timing of those events\nwas adequately alleged in the complaint. Instead, they dis-\npute whether the timing of those events meant that related\nclaims were barred as a matter of law. Thus, the district court\n\f10 No. 23-2788\n\nwas right to consider Basta\u2019s statute of limitations argument\nwhen ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n With this threshold matter settled, we consider whether\nthe statute of limitations legally barred the claims at issue\nhere. We have previously held that \u201csection 1983 claims aris-\ning in Illinois are governed by a two-year statute of limita-\ntions.\u201d Kelly v. City of Chicago, 4 F.3d 509, 511 (7th Cir. 1993).\nIn Kelly, we made three important observations: (1) courts\nlook to the personal injury laws of the state where the injury\noccurred to determine the statute of limitations in a \u00a7 1983\ncase; (2) federal law governs the accrual of claims for these\npurposes; and (3) courts apply the tolling laws of the state\nwhere the injury occurred. Id. These rules and principles\nguide us in answering two questions. We first ask when the\nclaims accrued. We then ask whether the limitations period\nwas tolled.\n As we observed in Kelly, the general standard for the ac-\ncrual question is that \u00a7 1983 claims \u201caccrue when the plaintiff\nknows or should know that his or her constitutional rights\nhave been violated.\u201d Id. (quoting Wilson v. Giesen, 956 F.2d\n738, 740 (7th Cir. 1992)). In this case, the two relevant petition\ndenials were discrete events that both occurred by September\n2019. It is difficult to imagine how NIAAA would not or\nshould not have known of the injuries it suffered as a result of\nthose denials in September 2019. And NIAAA does not pre-\nsent any support for an alternative conclusion. In its appellate\nbriefing, NIAAA does not directly challenge Basta\u2019s argu-\nment about when NIAAA\u2019s claims accrued. Thus, NIAAA\nhas waived any argument that the claims accrued after Sep-\ntember 2019. See Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v.\nMidwest Motor Express, Inc., 181 F.3d 799, 808 (7th Cir. 1999)\n\fNo. 23-2788 11\n\n(\u201cArguments not developed in any meaningful way are\nwaived.\u201d).\n NIAAA does argue, however, that its state court litigation\ntolled the limitations period. Illinois law does not support this\nargument. NIAAA points us to the Illinois continuing tort\ndoctrine, under which the limitations period is \u201ctolled\u201d for\ncontinuing violations. Despite courts occasionally using the\nword \u201ctoll\u201d when applying the doctrine, the Illinois continu-\ning tort doctrine governs only the point at which a claim ac-\ncrues. See Pitts v. City of Kankakee, Ill., 267 F.3d 592, 595 (7th\nCir. 2001) (\u201cThe continuing violation doctrine is \u2026 best char-\nacterized as a doctrine governing the accrual of a claim.\u201d); see\nalso Heard v. Sheahan, 253 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he\ncorrect characterization of the [Illinois] doctrine of continuing\nviolation is that it is a doctrine governing accrual, \u2026 not a toll-\ning doctrine[.]\u201d (citations omitted)); Powell v. City of Danville,\n625 N.E.2d 830, 831 (Ill. 1993) (\u201cThere are situations where the\ntortious conduct is continuing, and the limitations period be-\ngins on the date of the last injury (the date the tortious acts\ncease).\u201d). Thus, NIAAA has not offered, nor have we found,\nany authority to support NIAAA\u2019s position that its state court\nlitigation tolled the statute of limitations for its federal claims.\n For these reasons, we find that the relevant claims accrued\nby September 2019\u2014more than two years before NIAAA filed\nits complaint in federal court in February 2022\u2014and were not\ntolled for any period. Accordingly, we affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s ruling that NIAAA\u2019s claims \u201carising from the denials\nof the Initial Petition and the APS Petition are barred by the\nstatute of limitations.\u201d Nw. Ill. Area Agency on Aging v. Basta,\n3:22-cv-50070, 2023 WL 6057263, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 16, 2023).\n\f12 No. 23-2788\n\nB. Deprivation of Property Rights Without Due Process\n\nAlthough the statute of limitations problem is sufficient to\naffirm the dismissal of NIAAA\u2019s claims about the denial of\nthe Initial and APS Petitions, it does not support dismissal of\nthe State Plan Appeal claims. Therefore, we next consider\nwhether those claims implicate NIAAA\u2019s due process rights.\n NIAAA argues that Illinois state law establishes property\nrights enforceable under \u00a7 1983. But this is hard to square with\nthe fact that Illinois\u2019 highest court determined that Illinois\nstate law does not create such rights, at least regarding the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion. In Nyhammer, the Illinois Supreme Court considered the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion and held:\n Here, NIAAA makes no argument that it has a\n life or liberty interest in the subjects of its peti-\n tions for hearing. Thus, the only potentially ap-\n plicable interest NIAAA could have in the fund-\n ing or service provider designation for which it\n seeks a hearing from the Department is a prop-\n erty interest. However, to have a property inter-\n est, there must be more than a unilateral expec-\n tation of the funding or approval of its service\n provider designations. Rather, NIAAA must\n show a legitimate claim of entitlement to the\n funding or service provider designation for\n which it seeks a hearing.\n Applying these principles to the case at bar, we\n cannot say that NIAAA has a constitutionally\n protected property interest because NIAAA has\n\fNo. 23-2788 13\n\nnot alleged facts explaining how, under objec-\n tively ascertainable criteria set forth in the law\n that limits the Department's discretion in some\n way, it is entitled to the \u201cother funding\u201d or ser-\n vice provider designation approval that it seeks.\n215 N.E.3d at 950 (citations omitted).\n We see no reason why the denial of the hearing requested\nin NIAAA\u2019s State Plan Appeal\u2014which was not before the Il-\nlinois Supreme Court\u2014would have involved property rights\ncreated by state law where the first two denials did not. In its\nbriefing, the NIAAA notes that the third petition cited two\nagency regulations, but those would have also applied to the\nfirst two petitions, as would the Illinois Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. Thus, in accordance with the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Nyhammer, we affirm the district court\u2019s\nholding that NIAAA has failed to plausibly allege a due pro-\ncess violation. See Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Miscevic, 880 F.3d\n927, 934 (7th Cir. 2018) (\u201cWe must defer to a state court\u2019s in-\nterpretation of the state\u2019s statute.\u201d) (cleaned).\n C. The OAA & Section 1983\n\nOn the question of whether the OAA creates rights en-\nforceable under \u00a7 1983, NIAAA asks us to reach the same re-\nsult that the Supreme Court did in Health & Hospital Corp. of\nMarion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023). As we recently\nobserved, the Supreme Court in Talevski provided a twofold\ntest to analyze whether a Spending Clause statute creates a\nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Saint Anthony Hosp. v. White-\nhorn, 132 F.4th 962, 970\u201371 (7th Cir. 2025) (citing Talevski, 599\nU.S. at 180\u2013183); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl.,\n145 S. Ct. 2219, 2229\u201334 (2025) (clarifying the analysis). The\n\f14 No. 23-2788\n\nfirst part of that analysis asks whether Congress \u201cunambigu-\nously conferred individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries\nto which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183\n(cleaned). If we answer that question in the affirmative, then\nthe second part of the Talevski analysis asks whether Congress\nintended to preclude the enforcement of those individual\nrights via \u00a7 1983. Id. at 186.\n Applying that two-part approach in Talevski, the Court\nconcluded that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act\u2019s\n(FNHRA) unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice pro-\nvisions \u201cunambiguously\u201d conferred such rights to nursing\nhome residents. Id. at 184 (citing Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S.\n273, 284 (2002)). The nursing home residents cleared the first\nhurdle because the provisions at issue spoke specifically in\nterms of individual rights. Id. at 184\u201386. And the defendants\ncould not rebut the resulting presumption\u2014that is, that the\nindividual rights Congress created in the FNHRA could be\nenforced via \u00a7 1983\u2014because enforcement under \u00a7 1983 was\ncompatible with the enforcement scheme provided for in the\nFNHRA. Id. at 187\u201391.\n Here, the district court determined that the OAA differs\nfrom the FNHRA in both relevant respects. At the first step of\nthe Talevski analysis, we \u201cemploy traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Here, those tools leave\nus without the necessary conviction that the OAA provisions\nat issue in this case create individual rights enforceable by\nNIAAA. So, we need not reach the second part of the analysis.\n Starting with \u00a7 3027 of the OAA, we conclude that this pro-\nvision does not create an individual right enforceable under\n\u00a7 1983 for three reasons.\n\fNo. 23-2788 15\n\nFirst, the context of \u00a7 3027 militates against this determi-\nnation. Although the OAA speaks to older Americans\u2019 \u201centi-\ntlements\u201d generally, \u00a7 3027 was not enacted to secure those\nentitlements per se, but to regulate federal funding related to\nthose entitlements. An indicator of that purpose, for example,\nis the remedy the section provides for noncompliance. See\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981)\n(\u201c[T]he typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally\nimposed conditions is not a private cause of action for non-\ncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to\nterminate funds to the State.\u201d). Here, that remedy is the ter-\nmination of funds to non-compliant states. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3027(d) (\u201cDiscontinuance of Payments\u201d).\n Second, \u00a7 3027 does not identify area agencies specifically\nor older persons more generally as the benefited class.\nWhereas the FNHRA\u2019s relevant provisions spoke directly to\nnursing home residents\u2019 needs and welfare, \u00a7 3027 speaks\nonly in terms of the states. It deals with giving funds to states,\nwithholding those funds from states, allowing states to appeal\nfindings made by the federal government, the notice afforded\nto states, and the limitations of states\u2019 power.\n Third, no provision of \u00a7 3027 specifically confers rights to\nresidents. Although it requires detailed state plans targeted at\nspecific services, \u00a7 3027 governs neither how those services\nare to be administered nor what individual rights (if any) the\nservices are intended to secure. This differs from the FNHRA\nprovisions at issue in Talevski which required nursing homes\nto protect \u201ctransfer and discharge rights\u201d and \u201cprotect and\npromote the right to be free from any physical or chemical re-\nstraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience\nand not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\u201d\n\f16 No. 23-2788\n\nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (emphasis in original) (cleaned)\n(citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1369r(c)(2)); see also\nMedina, 145 S. Ct. at 2234 (\u201c[T]he statutes at issue in Talevski\nsupply the only reliable yardstick against which to measure\nwhether spending-power legislation confers a privately en-\nforceable right.\u201d). Indeed, there is no mention of individual\n\u201crights,\u201d \u201cprivileges,\u201d \u201cimmunities,\u201d or any similar language,\nin \u00a7 3027.\n As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, \u00a7 1983 per-\nmits plaintiffs \u201cto sue for violations of federal spending-\npower statutes only in \u2018atypical\u2019 situations \u2026.\u201d Medina, 145 S.\nCt. at 2239 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). For the three rea-\nsons discussed above, we are left unconvinced that \u00a7 3027 is\nthe sort of \u201catypical\u201d provision contemplated in Talevski.\n Turning to \u00a7 3026(f)(2) of the OAA, we see no reason to\nengage in the Talevski analysis. This is because, even if the pro-\nvision could be enforced via \u00a7 1983, NIAAA failed to state a\nclaim against Basta. Recall, NIAAA claimed that \u00a7 3026(f)(2)\nrequired the IDA to hold a hearing on the withheld funding\nat issue in the Initial Petition. Yet the defendant, Basta, played\nno role in that affair. As the district court noted, \u201cthere are no\nallegations from which it can plausibly be inferred that [Basta]\never made any decision to withhold OAA funding.\u201d Basta,\n2023 WL 6057263 at *5. In the Initial Petition, NIAAA alleged\nonly that Basta\u2019s predecessor withheld funds without first\ngranting a hearing. So, even if \u00a7 3026(f)(2) does create rights\nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u2014a question that we do not consider\ntoday\u2014NIAAA fails to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.\n\fNo. 23-2788 17\n\nHaving followed the approach set forth in Talevski, we af-\nfirm the district court\u2019s ruling that none of the relevant OAA\nprovisions create a right enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n\nIII\n\nIn conclusion, we find that the district court correctly de-\ncided the due process, \u00a7 1983, and statute of limitations issues\nNIAAA raises, and properly granted the motion to dismiss.\nBecause we affirm on those grounds, we do not reach the\nquestion of qualified immunity. See Hicks v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corr.,\n109 F.4th 895, 900 (7th Cir. 2024).\n The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED."

In the present case, the plaintiff broker contends that it had an exclusive agreement to secure certain financing on behalf of the defendant and that it was entitled to a commission even though it was not the procuring cause of a loan the defendant ultimately obtained. For the reasons that follow, we determine that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the transaction at issue and, therefore, we affirm the order appealed from.</p><p><i>Factual and Procedural Background</i></p>\n<p>In June 2020, the defendant, Aurora Properties, LLC, entered into an agreement with the plaintiff, Angelic Real Estate, LLC, a licensed real estate broker specializing in obtaining financing for commercial properties, for the plaintiff to secure certain financing on the defendant's behalf. The two-page letter agreement dated June 8, 2020 (hereinafter the agreement), stated that the defendant was engaging the plaintiff \"exclusively\" to obtain debt financing for multiple office buildings located in Tennessee. Under the \"scope\" provision of the agreement, the plaintiff was to \"assist [the defendant] in identifying, soliciting proposals from, and negotiating with financing providers for debt for the Properties.\" The scope provision set forth the terms of the defendant's desired loan and further provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p>\"[I]f under this Agreement [the plaintiff] does not secure, on or before June 20, 2020, one or more written quotes or terms sheets from lenders [with the desired terms], this Agreement shall remain in place but shall become non-exclusive with regards to any lenders not already approached and engaged by [the plaintiff]. In such instance, [the plaintiff] shall provide [the defendant] a list of its protected lenders it has gone to for the Properties . . . by the end of the next business day. Should [the plaintiff] subsequent to that date secure such terms with a lender on the [list], or with another [*2]lender who has not already provided a terms sheet to [the defendant], either directly or via another intermediary, the exclusivity clause of this Agreement shall be reinstated.\"</p>\n<p>The term of the agreement was 120 days from June 8, 2020. Pursuant to the agreement, if the defendant came to an agreement on terms for financing, the plaintiff was to be paid a fee at the closing of each funding pursuant to a specified fee scale. The agreement also contained an \"Exclusion\" provision, which stated that the above-referenced fee would not apply to a loan with three specified lenders, including Mountain Commerce Bank (hereinafter MCB), \"provided a terms sheet is signed with one of them on or before June 30, 2020.\"</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2020, the defendant obtained a $16,750,000 loan commitment from MCB. The plaintiff allegedly informed the defendant that if MCB entered into a terms sheet before the expiration of the agreement and after the exclusion period, i.e., June 30, 2020, the plaintiff would be entitled to a fee under the agreement. The defendant subsequently closed on the loan with MCB and did not tender a fee to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>In November 2020, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover the fee allegedly due under the agreement. The plaintiff subsequently moved for summary judgment on the complaint. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that the terms of the agreement were clear and unambiguous and granted the plaintiff the exclusive right to secure debt financing on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff argued that since the agreement was exclusive, it was entitled to a fee as long as the defendant obtained financing during the life of the agreement, regardless of whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the financing. The plaintiff further argued that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB outlined in the agreement, that exclusion period expired on June 30, 2020, nearly two months before the defendant entered into a terms sheet with MCB.</p>\n<p>The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendant contended, among other things, that the agreement contained no clear and express language that a fee was owed regardless of the defendant independently negotiating its own terms. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff therefore was not entitled to a fee in connection with the defendant's loan from MCB, as there was no dispute the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of that loan.</p>\n<p>In an order dated October 11, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's motion and granted the defendant's cross-motion. The court determined, inter alia, that notwithstanding the fact the agreement's exclusion provision expired on June 30, 2020, given the lack of clear exclusivity in the agreement, the plaintiff was not entitled to receive a fee for a loan negotiated and secured solely by the defendant.</p>\n<p>This appeal by the plaintiff ensued.</p><p><i>Legal Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues on appeal, as it did before the Supreme Court, that it is entitled to a fee in connection with the MCB transaction because the agreement with the defendant was exclusive, and a broker is entitled to a commission under an exclusive agreement if a sales transaction occurs during the life of an agreement, whether or not the broker was the procuring cause of the transaction. The plaintiff further argues that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB, the plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to a fee because the loan commitment was obtained from MCB after the end of the exclusion period and before the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement, i.e., October 6, 2020.</p>\n<p>Generally, \"[t]o prevail on a cause of action to recover a commission, the broker must establish (1) that it is duly licensed, (2) that it had a contract, express or implied, with the party to be charged with paying the commission, and (3) that it was the procuring cause of the sale\" (<i>All Is. Estates Realty Corp. v Singh</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 1392</span>, 1392 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Blooming Home Realty, LLC v Infinity Holdings Northeast, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 AD3d 815</span>, 816). Thus, a broker seeking to recover a commission is normally required to make a showing that it was the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 AD3d 793</span>, 797 [involving a real estate brokerage agreement]; <i>Saunders Ventures, Inc. v Catcove Group, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">209 AD3d 893</span>, 896 [same]; <i>Multiloan Mtge.

However, there is a distinction between brokerage agreements granting an exclusive agency and those conferring an exclusive right to sell, the latter of which permits a broker to recover a commission even if it was not the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#534\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

In general, pursuant to an exclusive agency agreement, if the owner finds its own buyer, then no commission is due to the broker (<i>see U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v Hanna</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5989996\"><a href=\"/opinion/6124908/us-no-1-laffey-real-estate-v-hann/#553\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v.

UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 535</a></span> [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]), the Court of Appeals held that \"a contract giving rise to an exclusive right of sale must clearly and expressly provide that a commission is due upon sale by the owner or exclude the owner from independently negotiating a sale.\" The Court of Appeals explained that \"[r]equiring an affirmative and unequivocal statement to establish a broker's exclusive right to sell is consistent with the general principle that an owner's freedom to dispose of her own property should not be infringed upon by mere implication\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). In that case, the plaintiff broker had entered into a financial brokerage agreement with the defendant, which the plaintiff conceded lacked a provision expressly conferring an exclusive right of sale (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The plaintiff argued that, despite the absence of such provision, the court should \"examine the contract as a whole to deduce the parties' intent to create an exclusive right to sell or, if the agreement is ambiguous, to examine parol evidence\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The Court of Appeals rejected that approach \"in favor of a rule that, '[w]ithout an unequivocal expression of intent by its own terms or by necessary implication from its terms, the . . . contract is at most considered to create an exclusive agency, not excluding the owner's inherent right to sell his or her own property'\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>, quoting 11 NY Jur 2d, Brokers \u00a7 169).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i> also made clear that the rule requiring a clear statement to confer an exclusive right of sale is not limited to real estate [*4]brokerage agreements. In rejecting the plaintiff's argument seeking to apply such a limitation, the Court of Appeals stated that it saw \"no reason to apply a different rule to brokerage contracts concerning the sale of financial instruments in the investment banking context,\" noting that, \"[i]n both cases, the governing principles arise from the law of agency and contract, not from the law of real property\" (<i>id.</i> at 536).</p>\n<p>The same reasoning has been applied in the context of brokerage agreements to secure financing. For example, in <i>Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i> (<span class=\"citation no-link\">197 AD3d 1057</span>, 1058), the defendant Crosswing Holdings, LLC (hereinafter Crosswing), retained the plaintiff Silvergrove Advisors, LLC (hereinafter Silvergrove), to assist it in obtaining financing. Crosswing obtained an interim bridge loan during the life of the agreement, and Silvergrove contended that it was entitled to a success fee for the bridge loan even though it had not been involved in that transaction (<i>see <span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>). The Appellate Division, First Department, in pertinent part, upheld the determination denying that branch of Silvergrove's motion which was for summary judgment in connection with recovering that success fee, noting that \"the contractual language plainly states that Silvergrove was not given an exclusive right of sale, but was simply made defendants' exclusive broker\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>, citing <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">23 NY3d 528</a></span>).</p>\n<p>In contrast, in <i>Matusik v Ward</i> (<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/#1215\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v. Ward\">68 AD3d 1213, 1215</a></span>), certain defendants had entered into an agreement to obtain financing for a hotel project with a licensed real estate salesperson associated with the plaintiff, which set forth a period of exclusivity during which time the salesperson was entitled to a commission, regardless of whether he or another party procured the financing commitment. Given this language, the Appellate Division, Third Department, held that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of liability on his cause of action to recover a commission pursuant to that agreement even though the parties disputed the extent to which the salesperson was involved in the negotiation of the loan (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v. Ward\">id.</a></span></i>).</p>\n<p>Applying these principles here, the defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the complaint. Initially, it is undisputed that the plaintiff did not secure a lender or loan with conforming terms on behalf of the defendant before June 20, 2020. Further, the defendant demonstrated that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the loan the defendant independently obtained from MCB in August 2020. The agreement did not clearly and expressly provide the plaintiff with the exclusive right to deal or negotiate on the defendant's behalf (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

Hayt, Hayt &amp; Landau\">264 AD2d at 815</a></span>; <i>see also Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i>, 197 AD3d at 1058). The defendant also demonstrated that the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of the loan from MCB (<i>see Alta Capital Partners Intl. LLC v Parsons Cap. LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4222525\"><a href=\"/opinion/4445272/alta-capital-partners-international-llc-v-parsons-capital-llc/#493\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Alta Capital Partners International LLC v.

Hayt, Hayt &amp; Landau\">264 AD2d at 815</a></span>).</p>\n<p>In opposition to the defendant's prima facie showing, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The plaintiff does not contend that the exclusion provision or any other part of the agreement is ambiguous, but rather, that the clear and unambiguous terms of the agreement entitled the plaintiff to a fee if a terms sheet was issued by MCB after June 30, 2020, but prior to the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement. However, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, nothing in the agreement, either expressly or by necessary implication, obligated the defendant to pay a fee to the plaintiff upon the expiration of the exclusion provision on June 30, 2020 (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

The order, insofar as appealed from, denied those branches of the plaintiff's motion which were for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Navigation Law \u00a7 181 and dismissing the defendants' first and sixth affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof denying that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the defendants' sixth affirmative defense, and substituting therefor a provision granting that branch of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants to recover damages for injury to her property caused by an oil spill that occurred in October 2018. In their answer, the defendants asserted culpable conduct and failure to mitigate as their first and sixth affirmative defenses, respectively. Following discovery, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Navigation Law \u00a7 181 and dismissing the defendants' first and sixth affirmative defenses. In an order entered January 18, 2024, the Supreme Court, among other things, denied those branches of the plaintiff's motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"Pursuant to Navigation Law \u00a7 181(1), 'any person who has discharged petroleum shall be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for all cleanup and removal costs and all direct and indirect damages'\" (<i>Massaro v Rockland Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">218 AD3d 458</span>, 458 [alteration omitted], citing <i>State of New York v Speonk Fuel, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9706009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989168/state-v-speonk-fuel-inc/#723\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v. Speonk Fuel, Inc.\">3 NY3d 720, 723</a></span>; <i>see</i> Navigation Law \u00a7 181[1]). \"However, a claim may only be maintained by a person who is not responsible for the discharge\" (<i>Massaro v Rockland Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, 218 AD3d at 458-459 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"Discharge\" is defined as \"any intentional or unintentional action or omission resulting in the releasing, spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying or dumping of petroleum\" (Navigation Law \u00a7 172[8]; <i>see Paradise v Perillo Bros. Heating Corp.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">231 AD3d 961</span>, 962). \"'Owners who have control over activities occurring on their property and reason to believe that petroleum products are stored there are liable as a discharger'\" (<i>Paradise v Perillo Bros. Heating [*2]Corp.</i>, 231 AD3d at 962, quoting <i>Brilliante v East Hampton Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">221 AD3d 947</span>, 948). \"Thus, 'the owner of the property at which petroleum has been released may have a claim under the Navigation Law provided such person did not cause or contribute to the contamination'\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>, quoting <i>Massaro v Rockland Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, 218 AD3d at 459). \"An owner's 'failure, unintentional or otherwise, to take any action in controlling the events that led to the spill or to effect an immediate cleanup renders it liable as a discharger'\" (<i>Massaro v Rockland Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, 218 AD3d at 459, quoting <i>State of New York v Green</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2082588\"><a href=\"/opinion/2082588/state-of-new-york-v-green/#407\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State of New York v. Green\">96 NY2d 403, 407</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Here, the plaintiff failed to establish her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Navigation Law \u00a7 181 and dismissing the defendants' first affirmative defense. The plaintiff's submissions failed to eliminate all triable issues of fact as to the cause of the oil spill, including whether the oil spill was caused by the defendants' overfilling of the subject oil tank or was the result of a fault in the subject oil tank itself, which the defendants had no contractual obligation to maintain. Thus, the plaintiff failed to eliminate triable issues of fact as to whether she is liable as a discharger of oil on her property (<i>see Brilliante v East Hampton Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, 221 AD3d at 949; <i>Massaro v Rockland Fuel Oil Corp.</i>, 218 AD3d at 459). Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied those branches of the plaintiff's motion which were for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Navigation Law \u00a7 181 and dismissing the defendants' first affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>However, the Supreme Court should have granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the defendants' sixth affirmative defense. The plaintiff established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing this affirmative defense through the submission of evidence demonstrating that she engaged in diligent efforts to mitigate damages, including by promptly reporting the oil spill and undertaking professional remediation (<i>see Wilmot v State of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9788016\"><a href=\"/opinion/2591647/wilmot-v-state-of-new-york/#168\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Wilmot v.

Rademaker, J.), dated September 5, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied those branches of that defendant's motion which were (1) pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(1) to vacate so much of a judgment of the same court entered June 24, 2021, as, upon his failure to appear or answer the complaint, was in favor of the plaintiffs and against him and (2) for leave to interpose an answer.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p>\n<p>In February 2020, the plaintiffs commenced this action against Zvi Schiff and other defendants, inter alia, to recover damages for breach of contract in connection with numerous real estate transactions. Schiff failed to appear or answer the complaint. In June 2021, the plaintiff obtained a default judgment against, among others, Schiff. In March 2023, Schiff moved, among other things, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(1) to vacate so much of the judgment as was in favor of the plaintiffs and against him and for leave to interpose an answer. The Supreme Court, inter alia, denied those branches of Schiff's motion. Schiff appeals.</p>\n<p>A defendant seeking to vacate a default in answering or appearing upon the ground of excusable default pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(1) must demonstrate a reasonable excuse for the default and a potentially meritorious defense to the action (<i>see Eugene Di Lorenzo, Inc. v A.C. Dutton Lbr. Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5537303\"><a href=\"/opinion/5688134/eugene-di-lorenzo-inc-v-a-c-dutton-lumber-co/#141\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Eugene Di Lorenzo, Inc. v.

Schiff's conclusory and unsubstantiated claim that he was hampered by the restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic does not amount to a reasonable excuse (<i>see American Cancer Socy., Inc. v Ashby</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 AD3d 805</span>, 807). Further, Schiff failed to establish that he had a reasonable excuse for his lengthy delay in moving to vacate the judgment (<i>see Byung [*2]Ha Lee v Mascarenas</i>, 219 AD3d at 929).</p>\n<p>Since Schiff failed to establish a reasonable excuse for his default, it is unnecessary to determine whether he demonstrated a potentially meritorious defense to the action (<i>see Deutsche Bank Natl.

Martielli of counsel), for respondent.</p>\n<br><br>\n\n<p>DECISION &amp; ORDER</p>\n<p>In an action to recover damages for abuse of process, the defendants appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (James Hudson, J.), dated July 1, 2024. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint and denied the separate motion of the defendant Patricia Weiss for recusal of the Justice presiding.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the appeal by the defendants David J. Whelan and Mary M. Whelan from so much of the order as denied the motion of the defendant Patricia Weiss for recusal of the Justice presiding is dismissed, as those defendants are not aggrieved by that portion of the order (<i>see</i> CPLR 5511); and it is further,</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from by the defendant Patricia Weiss and insofar as reviewed on the appeal by the defendants David J. Whelan and Mary M. Whelan; and it is further,</p>\n<p>ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>In December 2019, the defendants David J. Whelan and Mary M. Whelan (hereinafter together the Whelans) commenced an action (hereinafter the Whelans' action) against the plaintiff, inter alia, to recover damages for private nuisance. In March 2022, the Whelans, by their attorney, the defendant Patricia Weiss, filed a notice of pendency against the plaintiff's property. In an order dated August 8, 2022, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was to vacate the notice of pendency. That portion of the order was subsequently affirmed by this Court (<i>see Whelan v Busiello</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 778</span>).</p>\n<p>In March 2024, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, seeking to recover damages for abuse of process. The defendants moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint. Weiss thereafter separately moved for recusal of the Justice presiding. In an order dated July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court, among other things, denied that branch of the defendants' motion and denied Weiss's separate motion. The defendants appeal.</p>\n<p>\"Pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(4), a court has broad discretion in determining whether an action should be dismissed based upon another pending action where there is a substantial identity of the parties, the two actions are sufficiently similar, and the relief sought is substantially the same\" (<i>DAIJ, Inc. v Roth</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5824628\"><a href=\"/opinion/5965608/daij-inc-v-roth/#959\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: DAIJ, Inc. v. Roth\">85 AD3d 959, 959</a></span>; <i>see Brach v Schwartz</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">215 AD3d 913</span>, 914). Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(4) on the ground that it raised issues duplicative of the Whelans' action, since the two actions were not sufficiently similar and sought distinct relief (<i>see Mazzei v Kyriacou</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3202735\"><a href=\"/opinion/3202841/mazzei-v-kyriacou/#824\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Mazzei v.

Sikorjak\">50 AD3d 1074, 1077</a></span>; <i>see</i> CPLR 215).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court properly denied dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations. The defendants failed to demonstrate that the time within which to commence this action had expired (<i>see Muro-Light v Farley</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5854104\"><a href=\"/opinion/5993178/muro-light-v-farley/#846\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Muro-Light v. Farley\">95 AD3d 846, 846</a></span>; <i>Village of Val. Stream v Zulli</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">64 AD2d 609</span>, 610).</p>\n<p>\"On a motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) for failure to state a cause of action, the court must afford the pleading a liberal construction, accept all facts as alleged in the pleading to be true, accord the plaintiff the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\" (<i>Hughes v Vento</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">226 AD3d 753</span>, 754; <i>see Leon v Martinez</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123647/leon-v-martinez/#87\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Leon v. Martinez\">84 NY2d 83, 87</a></span>). The elements of a cause of action alleging abuse of process are: \"(1) regularly issued process, either civil or criminal, (2) an intent to do harm without excuse or justification, and (3) use of the process in a perverted manner to obtain a collateral objective\" (<i>Curiano v Suozzi</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5536506\"><a href=\"/opinion/5687377/curiano-v-suozzi/#116\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Curiano v. Suozzi\">63 NY2d 113, 116</a></span>; <i>see Hughes v Vento</i>, 226 AD3d at 754).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court properly denied dismissal of the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7). At this early stage of litigation, where the plaintiff's allegations in the complaint are accepted as true and are accorded the benefit of every possible favorable inference, the cause of action alleging abuse of process was sufficiently pleaded (<i>cf. Schilt v Matherson</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5910479\"><a href=\"/opinion/6047111/schilt-v-matherson/#669\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Schilt v.

Here, Weiss failed to establish a basis for recusal pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 14 and failed to set forth any proof of bias or prejudice on the part of the Justice presiding that would have warranted recusal (<i>see Wilmington Sav.

Lancman, J.), entered March 8, 2023. The order denied that defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(4) to vacate an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale (one paper ) of the same court (Chere\u00e9 A. Buggs, J.) entered December 5, 2018, and pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against her for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to comply with RPAPL 1304.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for a hearing to determine whether the defendant Venita Raichandra-Ragnauth was properly served with process pursuant to CPLR 308(2), and for a new determination thereafter of that defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(4) to vacate the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale and pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against her.</p>\n<p>In August 2014, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose a mortgage against, among others, the defendant Venita Raichandra-Ragnauth (hereinafter the defendant). The defendant failed to appear or answer the complaint. In an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale entered December 5, 2018, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to confirm a referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale, confirmed the referee's report, and directed the sale of the subject property.</p>\n<p>In September 2022, the defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(4) to vacate the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale and pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against her for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to comply with RPAPL 1304. In an order entered March 8, 2023, the Supreme Court denied the defendant's motion. The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p>\"CPLR 5015(a)(4) provides for vacatur of a judgment or order upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction to render the judgment or order\" (<i>Deutsche Bank Natl.

Thus, the process server's affidavit constituted prima facie evidence of proper service upon the defendant (<i>see</i> CPLR 308;<i> Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Stroman</i>, 202 AD3d at 807).</p>\n<p>However, the defendant sufficiently rebutted the presumption of proper service. The defendant submitted evidence that the subject property is a two-family residence, consisting of two separate apartments with two separate exterior entrances, and the process server did not specify at which apartment service was made. The defendant further averred that no one visited her apartment on the date in question purporting to serve her with legal papers. Under these circumstances, a hearing to determine the validity of service upon the defendant pursuant to CPLR 308(2) is necessary (<i>see Legal Servicing, LLC v Carty</i>, 229 AD3d at 535-536; <i>see also Thacker v Malloy</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4151218\"><a href=\"/opinion/4373965/thacker-v-malloy/#857\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Thacker v.

The order dated October 5, 2023, denied the defendants' motion, inter alia, to vacate the note of issue and to compel the plaintiff to provide certain discovery. The order dated January 17, 2024, insofar as appealed from, in effect, upon reargument, adhered to the determination in the order dated October 5, 2023, denying the defendants' motion, among other things, to vacate the note of issue and to compel the plaintiff to provide certain discovery.</p>\n<p>ORDERED the appeal from the order dated October 5, 2023, is dismissed, as that order was superseded by the order dated January 17, 2024, made, in effect, upon reargument; and it is further,</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order dated January 17, 2024, is affirmed insofar as appealed from; and it is further,</p>\n<p>ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>In October 2019, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries he allegedly sustained in April 2019, when he tripped and fell on a sidewalk abutting the defendants' property.</p>\n<p>At his deposition held in September 2021, the plaintiff testified that he had been involved in a motor vehicle accident subsequent to his April 2019 trip and fall, which motor vehicle accident the defendants subsequently determined had occurred in October 2020. The plaintiff testified, inter alia, that he received therapy for lower back pain in connection with the motor vehicle accident, but that he had not commenced an action to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained in that accident. In February 2022, the defendants served post-deposition discovery demands seeking, among other things, information regarding the motor vehicle accident. In a [*2]response dated May 27, 2022, the plaintiffs did not disclose information regarding the motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p>In April 2023, the plaintiff filed a note of issue and certificate of readiness.</p>\n<p>In September 2023, the defendants moved, inter alia, to vacate the note of issue on the basis that they had recently learned that the plaintiff had commenced an action in January 2023 to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident, and that the plaintiff was alleging, among other things, that the motor vehicle accident had exacerbated a preexisting condition, which he had sustained as a result of a 2019 trip and fall accident. The defendants asserted that they had also recently learned that the plaintiff had been involved in a trip and fall accident in September 2019. The defendants also sought to compel the plaintiff to provide discovery regarding the motor vehicle accident and the September 2019 trip and fall accident, including, inter alia, medical authorizations, and to appear for a further deposition and independent medical examinations. The plaintiff opposed the motion. In an order dated October 5, 2023, the Supreme Court denied the defendants' motion. The defendants thereafter moved for leave to reargue their prior motion, and the plaintiff opposed the motion. In an order dated January 17, 2024, the court, in effect, granted reargument, and upon reargument, adhered to the determination in the order dated October 5, 2023, denying the defendants' prior motion. The defendants appeal.</p>\n<p>A motion to vacate a note of issue is addressed to the sound discretion of the Supreme Court (<i>see Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Ghaness</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 AD3d 791</span>, 792-793). \"'Where a party's motion to vacate a note of issue is timely, the party is required only to demonstrate why the case is not ready for trial'\" (<i>Plenty v New York City Tr. Auth.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">229 AD3d 571</span>, 573, quoting <i>Reardon v Macy's, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">191 AD3d 712</span>, 714 [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see</i> 22 NYCRR 202.21[e]). \"However, where the motion is not timely, the party seeking relief must meet the more difficult standard of 22 NYCRR 202.21(d)\" (<i>Plenty v New York City Tr. Auth.</i>, 229 AD3d at 573 [internal quotation marks omitted]), which requires the movant to demonstrate that \"unusual or unanticipated circumstances [have] develop[ed] subsequent to the filing of [the] note of issue . . . which require additional pretrial proceedings to prevent substantial prejudice\" (22 NYCRR 202.21[d]; <i>see Plenty v New York City Tr. Auth.</i>, 229 AD3d at 573; <i>Audiovox Corp. v Benyamini</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6040574\"><a href=\"/opinion/6174657/audiovox-corp-v-benyamini/#138\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Audiovox Corp. v. Benyamini\">265 AD2d 135, 138-139</a></span>). In support of their motion, the defendants asserted, inter alia, that the plaintiff failed to respond to information requested in post-deposition discovery demands served in February 2022 regarding the motor vehicle accident. Yet, despite the outstanding discovery demands, when the plaintiff filed the note of issue in April 2023, the defendants failed to object. \"A lack of diligence in seeking discovery does not constitute unusual or unanticipated circumstances warranting post-note of issue disclosure\" (<i>Tirado v Miller</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5804420\"><a href=\"/opinion/5945829/tirado-v-miller/#161\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Tirado v.

Benyamini\">265 AD2d at 140</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Here, the defendants' motion, inter alia, to vacate the note of issue was made in September 2023, more than four months after the note of issue had been filed. That branch of the defendants' motion which was to vacate the note of issue was untimely, and the defendants failed to demonstrate the existence of unusual or unanticipated circumstances since the filing of the note of issue warranting its vacatur (<i>see Plenty v New York City Tr. Auth.</i>, 229 AD3d at 573). For the same reasons, the defendants failed to demonstrate that additional discovery was warranted (<i>see</i> 22 NYCRR 202.21[d]; <i>Audiovox Corp. v Benyamini</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6040574\"><a href=\"/opinion/6174657/audiovox-corp-v-benyamini/#140\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Audiovox Corp. v. Benyamini\">265 AD2d at 140</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court, in effect, upon reargument, properly adhered to its determination denying the defendants' motion, inter alia, to vacate the note of issue and to compel further discovery (<i>see Plenty v New York City Tr. Auth.</i>, 229 AD3d at 573).</p>\n<p>GENOVESI, J.P., CHRISTOPHER, DOWLING and LOVE, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Graham, J.), dated December 22, 2022. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied those branches of those defendants' separate motions which were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the amended complaint insofar as asserted against each of them.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, with one bill of costs payable to the defendants Wartburg Receiver, LLC, doing business as Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Health Care, sued herein as Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Health Care, Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and [*2]Healthcare, and Wartburg Receiver, LLC, and Centers for Specialty Care Group, LLC, sued herein as Centers Health Care, LLC, Centers for Specialty Care Group, LLC, and Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC, and the defendants Allure Care Management, LLC, doing business as Bedford Center for Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation, sued herein as Bedford Center for Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation and Allure Care Management, LLC, and Allure Group, LLC, appearing separately and filing separate briefs, and those branches of those defendants' separate motions which were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the amended complaint insofar as asserted against each of them are granted.</p>\n<p>In January 2021, the plaintiffs, Brenda Ellis, the wife of the decedent, Jeffrey Ross, as \"Proposed Administrator\" of the estate of Jeffrey Ross, and the estate of Jeffrey Ross, commenced an action to recover damages for medical malpractice and wrongful death against, among others, the defendants Wartburg Receiver, LLC, doing business as Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Health Care, sued herein as Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Health Care, Bushwick Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare, and Wartburg Receiver, LLC, and Centers for Specialty Care Group, LLC, sued herein as Centers Health Care, LLC, Centers for Specialty Care Group, LLC, and Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC (hereinafter together the Bushwick defendants), and the defendants Allure Care Management, LLC, doing business as Bedford Center for Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation, sued herein as Bedford Center for Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation and Allure Care Management, LLC, and Allure Group, LLC (hereinafter together the Bedford defendants) (hereinafter the January 2021 action). Thereafter, the Bushwick defendants moved to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them in the January 2021 action pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3) and EPTL 5-4.1 for lack of capacity to sue on the ground that Ellis commenced the action as the \"Proposed Administrator\" of Ross's estate as she had not been appointed the administrator of Ross's estate. The Bedford defendants moved for the same relief insofar as asserted against them. The plaintiffs did not file opposition papers, and at oral argument, the plaintiffs' counsel stated that the plaintiffs did not oppose the Bushwick defendants' and the Bedford defendants' respective motions. In orders dated July 20, 2021, and July 27, 2021, respectively (hereinafter together the July 2021 dismissal orders), the Supreme Court granted the Bushwick defendants' and the Bedford defendants' separate motions. The order dated July 20, 2021, was entered July 23, 2021, and served with notice of entry. The order dated July 27, 2021, was entered July 30, 2021. The plaintiffs appealed from the order dated July 20, 2021, but that appeal was not perfected. In May 2022, a judgment was entered dismissing the January 2021 action.</p>\n<p>On January 20, 2022, the plaintiffs commenced the instant action by filing a summons</p>\n<p>and complaint, again characterizing Ellis as the\"Proposed Administrator.\" Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint stating that Ellis was issued letters of administration on February 7, 2022. The Bushwick defendants moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the amended complaint insofar as asserted against them, and the Bedford defendants moved, among other things, for the same relief insofar as asserted against them. In opposition, the plaintiffs relied upon the savings provision of CPLR 205(a). In an order dated December 22, 2022, the Supreme Court, inter alia, denied those branches of the Bushwick defendants' and the Bedford defendants' separate motions. The Bushwick defendants and the Bedford defendants separately appeal.</p>\n<p>CPLR 205(a) provides, in relevant part, that a plaintiff may commence a new action upon the same transactions or occurrences as the prior action \"within six months after the termination [of the prior action] provided that the new action would have been timely commenced at the time of commencement of the prior action and that service upon defendant is effected within such six-month period\" (<i>Delzotti v Bowers</i>, 219 AD3D 967, 970; <i>see Sokoloff v Schor</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">176 AD3d 120</span>, 127). \"[T]ermination of the prior action occurs when appeals as of right are exhausted, or, when discretionary appellate review is granted, upon final determination of the discretionary appeal\" (<i>Malay v City of Syracuse</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489816\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643827/malay-v-city-of-syracuse/#328\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Malay v.

Enlarged City School District\">95 NY2d 59, 64</a></span>). Here, the July 2021 dismissal orders in the January 2021 action were not appealable at all, because the plaintiff did not oppose the motions to dismiss the complaint in the January 2021 action (<i>see</i> CPLR 5511; <i>Mixon v TBV</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">76 AD3d 144</span>, 157 n 3). Thus, the January 2021 action terminated in July 2021.</p>\n<p>The instant action was commenced within six months of the July 2021 dismissal orders (<i>see Sokoloff v Schor</i>, 176 AD3d at 127), but Ellis still lacked the capacity to sue at that time. Further, the plaintiffs did not effect service on the Bushwick defendants and the Bedford defendants within the six-month period afforded by CPLR 205(a) for the commencement of a new action. Therefore, the Supreme Court should have granted those branches of the Bushwick defendants' and the Bedford defendants' separate motions which were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the amended complaint insofar as asserted against each of them (<i>see U.S. Bank v McLean</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">209 AD3d 792</span>; <i>J Constr. Co., LLC v Westchester Fire Ins. Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">165 AD3d 1076</span>).</p>\n<p>The parties' remaining contentions are either without merit or not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reverse the order dated December 22, 2022, insofar as appealed from and grant those branches of the Bushwick defendants' and the Bedford defendants' separate motions which were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the amended complaint insofar as asserted against each of them.</p>\n<p>BARROS, J.P., BRATHWAITE NELSON, WARHIT and MCCORMACK, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Cairo, J.), entered May 3, 2024. The order granted the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint is denied.</p>\n<p>In October 2023, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant pursuant to the Adult Survivors Act (ASA) (CPL 214-j), asserting causes of action to recover damages resulting from alleged acts of sexual assault committed against her in 2005. The defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the causes of action were time-barred (<i>see id.</i> \u00a7 215[3]) and that CPLR 214-j could not be used to revive the untimely causes of action because she previously commenced a timely action based on the same conduct that had been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. The prior action had been commenced in 2006 against, among others, the defendant. By decision and order dated December 8, 2009, the Appellate Division, First Department, inter alia, directed dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendant (<i>see Esposito v Isaac</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5787214\"><a href=\"/opinion/5929165/esposito-v-isaac/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Esposito v. Isaac\">68 AD3d 483</a></span>). In an order entered May 3, 2024, the Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion, determining that CPLR 214-j did not revive causes of actions that had previously been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court erred in granting the defendant's motion. CPLR 214-j, enacted as part of the ASA and effective May 24, 2022, opened a revival window during which adult victims of sexual abuse could assert civil claims or causes of action against their abusers for acts committed against them when they were 18 years or older that would otherwise be time-barred (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5787214\"><a href=\"/opinion/5929165/esposito-v-isaac/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Esposito v. Isaac\">id.</a></span></i>). CPLR 214-j provides, inter alia, that \"every civil claim or cause of action brought against any party alleging intentional or negligent acts or omissions by a person for physical, psychological, or other injury or condition suffered as a result of conduct which would constitute a sexual offense . . . committed against such person who was eighteen years of age or older . . . which is barred as of the effective date of this section because the applicable period of limitation has expired, and/or the plaintiff previously failed to file a notice of claim or a notice of intention to file a claim, is hereby revived.\" [*2]CPLR 214-j further provides that, \"[i]n any such claim or action, dismissal of a previous action, ordered before the effective date of this section, on grounds that such previous action was time barred, and/or for failure of a party to file a notice of claim or a notice of intention to file a claim, shall not be grounds for dismissal of a revival action pursuant to this section.\"</p>\n<p>Whether CPLR 214-j permits revival of an action that had previously been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction begins with reference to longstanding rules of statutory interpretation. \"'The primary consideration of courts in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the Legislature'\" (<i>Anonymous v Castagnola</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">210 AD3d 940</span>, 942 [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting <i>People v Galindo</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">38 NY3d 199</span>, 203; <i>accord North Shore Cent. Sch. Dist. v Glen Cove City Sch. Dist.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">236 AD3d 806</span>, 811). \"'As the clearest indicator of legislative intent is the statutory text, the starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language itself, giving effect to the plain meaning thereof'\" (<i>North Shore Cent. Sch. Dist. v Glen Cove City Sch. Dist.</i>, 236 AD3d at 811-812 [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting <i>Anonymous v Castagnola</i>, 210 AD3d at 942; <i>see Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent.

The plain language of CPLR 214-j provides that it revives \"<i>every</i> civil claim or cause of action\" alleging the subject conduct \"which is barred . . . because the applicable period of limitation has expired\" (emphasis added). The use of the word \"every\" in describing such claims or causes of action imports no limitation and evidences the Legislature's intent for revival to apply to all claims and causes of action that would otherwise be barred on statute of limitations grounds (<i>see Lynch v City of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">35 NY3d 517</span>, 523; <i>Prego v City of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5910930\"><a href=\"/opinion/6047555/prego-v-city-of-new-york/#170\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Prego v. City of New York\">147 AD2d 165, 170</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Moreover, contrary to the defendant's construction, the statutory language expressly including revival of actions that had previously been dismissed as \"time barred, and/or for failure of a party to file a notice of claim or a notice of intention to file a claim\" does not evidence the Legislature's intent to exclude all other previously-dismissed actions from revival. Had the Legislature intended for such a blanket exclusion to apply, it would have stated so with its words (<i>see Fossella v Adams</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">225 AD3d 98</span>,122, <i>mod</i> ____ NY3d ____, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"10827063\"><a href=\"/opinion/10360475/fossella-v-adams/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Fossella v. Adams\">2025 NY Slip Op 01668</a></span>; <i>Prego v City of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5910930\"><a href=\"/opinion/6047555/prego-v-city-of-new-york/#170\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Prego v. City of New York\">147 AD2d at 170</a></span>). Of course, \"[w]here the legislature has addressed a subject and provided specific exceptions to a general rule . . . the maxim <i>expressio unius est exlusio alterius </i>applies (<i>see</i> McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 240 at 412-413 ['where a statute creates provisos or exceptions as to certain matters the inclusion of such provisos or exceptions is generally considered to deny the existence of others not mentioned']\" (<i>Kimmel v State of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9875192\"><a href=\"/opinion/4390110/betty-l-kimmel-v-state-of-new-york/#394\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Betty L. Kimmel v. State of New York\">29 NY3d 386, 394</a></span>). Here, however, the statute's language expressly permitting revival of such previously-dismissed causes of actions does not create a proviso or exception to the general rule allowing for revival of \"every\" claim or action that would otherwise be barred on statute of limitations grounds. An action that was previously dismissed as time-barred, for example, would be barred on res judicata grounds (<i>see e.g. Sciangula v Montegut</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">165 AD3d 1188</span>, 1190) and, therefore, outside the ambit of CPLR 214-j in the absence of this express statutory language stating otherwise.</p>\n<p>Further, a construction that allows revival of the plaintiff's causes of action is consistent with the legislative intent behind the ASA. The Legislature intended for the ASA to greatly expand a victim's ability to seek redress against his or her abusers in court. The Sponsor's Memorandum explained that the ASA, as well as the Child Victims Act (CPLR 214-g), \"were predicated on the widespread recognition that New York's existing statutes of limitations were insufficient in giving survivors of these heinous crimes enough time to pursue justice through criminal charges or filing a civil lawsuit. . . . Those who have had justice denied them as a result of New York's formerly insufficient statutes of limitations should be given the opportunity to seek civil redress against their abuser or their abuser's enablers in a court of law\" (Senate Introducer's Mem [*3]in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2022, ch 203 at 7). During the Assembly Debate, the Assembly Sponsor of the ASA explained the decision to reopen the statute of limitations was because \"the statute of limitations was short [and victims] deserve the right to go back to court to seek justice\" (NY Assembly Debate on 2022 NY Senate Bill S66-A, May 23, 2022 [Assembly Debate Tr] at 27). Thus, by allowing revival of the plaintiff's causes of action under CPLR 214-j, the plaintiff may once again seek civil redress for her injuries in a court of law without the hindrance of the \"insufficient\" limitations period previously provided by CPLR 215(3).</p>\n<p>The defendant correctly points out that, in enacting the ASA, the Legislature recognized that victims of sexual assault suffer a \"special kind of trauma\" that \"take[s] time to process,\" and \"cannot bring their action in time for the deadline in the statute of limitations\" (<i>see</i> Assembly Debate Tr at 27). Indeed, the ASA has been found to address the \"injustice\" that \"even adult victims of sexual abuse too often have no legal remedies because they suppress memories of their abuse or they are afraid to come forward until it is too late to sue\" (<i>Carroll v Trump</i>, 650 F Supp 3d 213, 223 [SD NY] [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]). However, contrary to the defendant's contention, this does not mean that any victim who was previously able to timely commence an action should not be afforded the benefit of revival. The imposition of a distinction between those who had previously timely commenced an action that was dismissed and could not thereafter be recommenced solely because such action would be time-barred, and those who failed to wholly commence an action in the first instance, would improperly exclude the plaintiff from the ambit of CPLR 214-j based on an artificial distinction unsupported by either the plain language of the statute or its legislative purpose (<i>see Prego v City of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5910930\"><a href=\"/opinion/6047555/prego-v-city-of-new-york/#183\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Prego v. City of New York\">147 AD2d at 183</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have denied the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p>IANNACCI, J.P., WOOTEN, DOWLING and LOVE, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Weiss, P.C., Melville, NY, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Greenspoon Marder LLP, New York, NY (Raspreet Bhatia of counsel), for plaintiff-respondent and nonparty-respondent.</p>\n<br><br>\n\n<p>DECISION &amp; ORDER</p>\n<p>In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Dwayne A. Samuels appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (David P. Sullivan, J.), entered October 20, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied those branches of that defendant's motion which were to vacate a judgment of foreclosure and sale of the same court entered October 27, 2022, and to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, with costs, and those branches of the motion of the defendant Dwayne A. Samuels which were to vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale and to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him are granted.</p>\n<p>In 2007, the defendant Dwayne A. Samuels (hereinafter the defendant) executed a note in the amount of $564,000 in favor of EquiFirst Corporation, which was secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Elmont (hereinafter the subject property). The defendant allegedly defaulted on the note and mortgage by failing to pay the monthly installments due on June 1, 2009, and thereafter. In 2011, Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (hereinafter BNYM), EquiFirst Corporation's successor in interest, commenced an action against the defendant, among others, to foreclose the mortgage (hereinafter the prior action). In 2015, the prior action was marked with a docket notation stating \"PURGED NO ACTIVITY, PRE NOTE.\" According to the plaintiff, the prior action was abandoned.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB (hereinafter Wilmington), BNYM's successor in interest, commenced this action against the defendant, among others, to foreclose the mortgage. The following year, the Supreme Court granted Wilmington's motion, among other things, for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendant and for an order of reference. Thereafter, the plaintiff, Wilmington's successor in interest, moved, inter alia, to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. While the plaintiff's motion was pending, the Legislature passed the Foreclosure Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) (<i>see</i> L 2022, ch 821 [eff Dec. 30, 2022]). In October 2022, the court granted the motion, and a judgment [*2]of foreclosure and sale was entered. On December 30, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed FAPA into law (<i>see</i> Assembly Bill Cover Page, Bill Jacket, L 2022, ch 821 at 1; <i>Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v Dalal</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">232 AD3d 487</span>, 488).</p>\n<p>In April 2023, the plaintiff issued a notice of sale, which stated that a public auction regarding the subject property was scheduled for June 14, 2023. Prior to the auction date, the defendant sought, and the Supreme Court imposed, a stay of the auction sale. The defendant moved, among other things, to vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale and to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him as time-barred and pursuant to RPAPL 1301(3), relying upon certain statutory amendments enacted under FAPA. In an order entered October 20, 2023, the court, inter alia, denied those branches of the motion. The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p>An action to foreclose a mortgage is governed by a six-year statute of limitations (<i>see</i> CPLR 213[4]). \"Even if a mortgage is payable in installments, once a mortgage debt is accelerated, the entire amount is due and the statute of limitations begins to run on the entire debt\" (<i>Sarkar v Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">225 AD3d 641</span>, 643 [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]). \"An acceleration of a mortgage debt can occur when a creditor commences an action to foreclose upon a note and mortgage and seeks, in the complaint, payment of the full balance due\" (<i>Collins v Bank of N.Y. Mellon</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">227 AD3d 948</span>, 950 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p>Prior to FAPA, the Court of Appeals held that a noteholder that had caused the six-year limitations period to foreclose a mortgage secured by real property to accrue by electing to accelerate the debt could revoke the acceleration through a unilateral affirmative act of revocation occurring during the limitations period, such as by issuing a clear and unambiguous de-acceleration letter, or by voluntarily discontinuing a foreclosure action (<i>see Freedom Mtge. Corp. v. Engel</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">37 NY3d 1</span>, 32; <i>Pennymac Corp. v Holcomb</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">198 AD3d 978</span>, 980-981; <i>U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. v Mohammed</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">197 AD3d 1205</span>, 1206-1207). Pursuant to FAPA, such a noteholder can no longer unilaterally revoke a prior election to accelerate the debt (<i>see</i> L 2022, ch 821, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 8; CPLR 203[h]; 3217[e]; <i>Bank of N.Y. Mellon v Stewart</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 AD3d 720</span>, 722-723).</p>\n<p>Here, as an initial matter, the plaintiff contended that FAPA was not intended to have a retroactive effect. However, \"FAPA took effect 'immediately,' applying 'to all actions commenced on an instrument described under [CPLR 213(4)] in which a final judgment of foreclosure and sale has not been enforced'\" (<i>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Edwards</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">231 AD3d 1189</span>, 1193, quoting L 2022, ch 821, \u00a7 10). Therefore, \"'[a]lthough the Legislature did not explicitly state that FAPA should apply retroactively, it clearly indicated that it should'\" (<i>id.</i>, quoting <i>Genovese v Nationstar Mtge. LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">223 AD3d 37</span>, 44; <i>see U.S. Bank N.A. v Lynch</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">233 AD3d 113</span>). Nonetheless, even if FAPA is generally retroactive, the Supreme Court concluded that it does not apply where, as here, a plaintiff has scheduled a foreclosure auction sale, since the judgment of foreclosure and sale has been \"enforced\" in such circumstances (L 2022, ch 821, \u00a7 10). However, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the court improperly deemed the judgment of foreclosure and sale \"enforced\" upon the plaintiff's issuance of the notice of sale in April 2023. \"[E]nforcement of a judgment of foreclosure and sale is generally deemed complete when the sale is concluded\" (<i>Wilmington Sav. Fund Socy., FSB v Thomas</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">226 AD3d 1064</span>, 1067; <i>see Guardian Loan Co. v Early</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5532241\"><a href=\"/opinion/5683540/guardian-loan-co-v-early/#518\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Guardian Loan Co. v.

Cuming\">155 NY 309, 313</a></span>). Since the auction sale had not yet been held in this action as of the effective date of FAPA, the plaintiff had not yet enforced the judgment of foreclosure and sale at that time and, therefore, FAPA applies (<i>see </i>NYMBA Memo, Bill Jacket, L 2022, ch 821 at 217-218; <i>U.S. Bank N.A. v Lynch</i>, 233 AD3d at 118; <i>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Edwards</i>, 231 AD3d at 1193).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the plaintiff contends that retroactive application of FAPA in the circumstances presented here would be unconstitutional for various reasons (<i>see generally Wilmington Trust, N.A. v Farkas</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">232 AD3d 524</span>, 526-527; <i>Matter of Novara v Cantor Fitzgerald, LP</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5687054\"><a href=\"/opinion/5831343/claim-of-novara-v-cantor-fitzgerald-lp/#107\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Claim of Novara v. Cantor Fitzgerald, LP\">20 AD3d 103, 107-108</a></span>). However, since FAPA went into effect while the parties were litigating issues relating thereto in the Supreme Court, the plaintiff had the opportunity to raise its constitutional arguments in the court and failed to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff improperly raised these contentions for the first time on appeal (<i>see Wilson v Bergon Constr. Corp.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 1380</span>, 1383; <i>HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Jessup</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">194 AD3d 1026</span>, 1027).</p>\n<p>Considering that FAPA applies under the circumstances presented, the defendant established that the mortgage debt was accelerated in March 2011 when BNYM, the plaintiff's predecessor in interest, commenced the prior action and elected to call due the entire amount secured by the mortgage, thus triggering the accrual of the six-year limitations period (<i>see Bank of N.Y. Mellon v Norton</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 680</span>, 682). Since this action was not commenced until April 2017, the defendant demonstrated, prima facie, that this action was time-barred (<i>see U.S. Bank, N.A. v Jarrett</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">233 AD3d 731</span>). In opposition to the defendant's prima facie showing, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact (<i>see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Brandt</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">230 AD3d 623</span>, 625). Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted those branches of the defendant's motion which were to vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale and to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him as time-barred.</p>\n<p>The parties' remaining contentions either are without merit or need not be reached in light of our determination.</p>\n<p>BARROS, J.P., DOWLING, VENTURA and MCCORMACK, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Caloras, J.), entered July 9, 2021. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied those branches of the plaintiff's motion which were pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate a prior order of the same court (Martin J. Schulman, J.) dated March 30, 2016, sua sponte, directing dismissal of the complaint without prejudice and directing the Queens County Clerk to cancel and discharge a notice of pendency, and to restore the action to the active calendar, and granted the motion of nonparty 108-44 Liverpool Street, LLC, pursuant to CPLR 6514 to cancel a notice of pendency.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order entered July 9, 2021, is modified, on the law and in the exercise of discretion, by deleting the provision thereof denying those branches of the plaintiff's motion which were to vacate the order dated March 30, 2016, and to restore the action to the active calendar, and substituting therefor a provision granting those branches of the motion; as so modified, the order entered July 9, 2021, is affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n<p>On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff, Federal National Mortgage Association, commenced this action against the defendant Sheldon Davis (hereinafter the defendant), among others, to foreclose a mortgage encumbering certain real property located in Queens (hereinafter the property) and, on the same date, filed a notice of pendency. By order dated July 6, 2010, the plaintiff's application for an order of reference was denied with leave to renew subsequent to a conference being held in the Residential Foreclosure Part. On November 30, 2012, the plaintiff filed a \"renewal notice of pendency\" (hereinafter the 2012 notice of pendency). Thereafter, pursuant to a status conference order dated September 16, 2015 (hereinafter the status conference order), the plaintiff was directed, inter alia, to file an application for an order of reference or the next applicable application by a date certain. In an order dated March 30, 2016, based on the plaintiff's failure to [*2]comply with the terms of the status conference order, the Supreme Court, sua sponte, directed dismissal of the complaint without prejudice and directed the Queens County Clerk to cancel and discharge the 2012 notice of pendency (hereinafter the dismissal order).</p>\n<p>On March 3, 2020, the plaintiff filed a \"renewal notice of pendency\" (hereinafter the 2020 notice of pendency). Thereafter, on March 17, 2020, the defendant deeded the property to nonparty 108-44 Liverpool Street, LLC (hereinafter Liverpool).</p>\n<p>In September 2020, the plaintiff moved, among other things, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate the dismissal order and to restore the action to the active calendar. In March 2021, Liverpool moved pursuant to CPLR 6514 to cancel the 2020 notice of pendency. In an order entered July 9, 2021, the Supreme Court, inter alia, denied those branches of the plaintiff's motion and granted Liverpool's motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"[A] court's power to dismiss a complaint, sua sponte, is to be used sparingly and only when extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant dismissal\" (<i>Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. v Gonzales</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">215 AD3d 636</span>, 638 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"Here, the plaintiff's failure to comply with the status conference order directing it to file an application for an order of reference was not a sufficient ground upon which to direct dismissal of the complaint\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>; <i>see HSBC Bank USA, NA v Sung Eun Oh</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">225 AD3d 841</span>, 842). Moreover, contrary to the defendant's contention, under the circumstances, 22 NYCRR 202.27 did not provide a basis for the dismissal of the complaint (<i>see Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. v Gonzales</i>, 215 AD3d at 638). Therefore, the Supreme Court should have granted those branches of the plaintiff's motion which were pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate the dismissal order and to restore the action to the active calendar (<i>see Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. v Gonzales</i>, 215 AD3d at 638).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court properly granted Liverpool's motion pursuant to CPLR 6514 to cancel the 2020 notice of pendency, as the plaintiff was without authority to file a \"renewal notice of pendency\" where, as here, the court directed dismissal of the complaint (<i>see id.</i>; <i>Freidus v Sardelli</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5960466\"><a href=\"/opinion/6095976/freidus-v-sardelli/#580\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Freidus v.

The order, insofar as appealed from, granted that branch of the cross-motion of the defendant Lam and Co Consulting, LLC, incorrectly sued herein as L &amp; C Associates, LLC, which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against it.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant Lam and Co Consulting, LLC (hereinafter the defendant), incorrectly sued herein as L &amp; C Associates, LLC, among others, inter alia, to recover damages for negligence and damage to real property. The complaint alleged that the defendant was the architect responsible for the plans for construction work that damaged the plaintiff's property.</p>\n<p>An affidavit of service through the Secretary of State of New York shows that the summons and complaint were served upon an entity named L &amp; C Associates, LLC, on December 10, 2019.</p>\n<p>After the defendant failed to answer the complaint, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 3215(b) for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant.</p>\n<p>The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. The defendant contended that, despite the plaintiff's claims, it was never served. The defendant noted that, although it conducted business under the assumed name of L &amp; C Associates, Lam and Co Consulting, LLC, was a separate and distinct entity from L &amp; C Associates, LLC, and that there was no relationship or interconnection between the two entities.</p>\n<p>In an order dated April 15, 2021, the Supreme Court, inter alia, granted that branch of the defendant's cross-motion which was to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against it. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that the plaintiff incorrectly named and served L &amp; C Associates, LLC, and that the plaintiff failed to serve the defendant within the applicable three-year statute of limitations (<i>see</i> CPLR 214[4]). Under these circumstances, the naming of L &amp; C Associates, LLC, was, in fact, no naming at all (<i>see</i> <i>Ross v Lan Chile Airlines</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5681528\"><a href=\"/opinion/5825868/ross-v-lan-chile-airlines/#603\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Ross v. Lan Chile Airlines\">14 AD3d 602, 603</a></span>), and the issue here was not improper service, but no service (<i>see</i> <i>Kinder v Braunius</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5777578\"><a href=\"/opinion/5919835/kinder-v-braunius/#887\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Kinder v. Braunius\">63 AD3d 885, 887</a></span>). Accordingly, the Supreme Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant and properly directed dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against it.</p>\n<p>The parties' remaining contentions are either improperly raised for the first time on appeal or without merit.</p>\n<p>MILLER, J.P., FORD, LANDICINO and LOVE, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

The order, insofar as appealed from, granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff, Simon Galeas, is the owner of Steinway Dental Laboratory, Inc. (hereinafter Steinway), a New York corporation engaged in the business of dental laboratory services. Priceless Dental Care, P.C. (hereinafter Priceless), is a Connecticut corporation owned by the defendant Efrain Socarras or the defendant Deepit Anand. Prior to the commencement of the instant action, Priceless commenced an action against Steinway in Connecticut (hereinafter the Connecticut action) to recover damages for, inter alia, breach of contract, alleging, among other things, that dental laboratory products provided by Steinway were defective. Priceless was represented by the defendant David N. Feliu in the Connecticut action. Steinway appeared in the Connecticut action, asserting various counterclaims.</p>\n<p>In September 2019, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, inter alia, to recover damages for fraud. The plaintiff alleged that Socarras was indebted to the plaintiff and that Socarras and Feliu commenced the Connecticut action knowing that the allegations therein were false. The defendants moved, among other things, pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. In an order entered January 23, 2020, the Supreme Court, inter alia, granted that branch of the motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"In considering a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a cause of action, the court must afford the pleading a liberal construction, accept the facts as alleged in the pleading as true, accord the plaintiff the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\" (<i>Langley v Melville Fire Dist.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">213 AD3d 748</span>, 750; <i>see Leon v Martinez</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123647/leon-v-martinez/#88\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Leon v.

Lipper\">123 AD3d 34, 39-40</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Here, while the plaintiff alleges individual harm, the allegations of the complaint arise out of identical allegations asserted in Steinway's counterclaims in the Connecticut action. As the plaintiff failed to allege harm that was separate and distinct from the alleged harm to Steinway, the plaintiff's claims were embedded in the alleged harm to Steinway and may not separately stand (<i>see Patterson v Calogero</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4171434\"><a href=\"/opinion/4394181/patterson-v-calogero/#1133\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Patterson v.

The order granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p>In this action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice, the plaintiffs are the executors of the estate of Junior Jones (hereinafter the decedent) and the decedent's wife. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants, Montefiore Medical Center and Michael J. Vitti, negligently failed to timely diagnose and treat an infection in the decedent's right leg and negligently failed to admit the decedent to a hospital, ultimately resulting in the loss of the decedent's right leg.</p>\n<p>Following the completion of discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint, and the plaintiffs opposed the motion. The Supreme Court granted the defendants' motion. The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p>\"In a medical malpractice action, a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing either that there was no departure from good and accepted medical practice or that any departure was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries\" (<i>Gupta v Lescale</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">224 AD3d 668</span>, 669 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see McHale v Sweet</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">217 AD3d 666</span>, 667). \"Once this showing has been made, a plaintiff must submit evidentiary facts or materials to rebut the defendant's prima facie showing, so as to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact\" (<i>Gupta v Lescale</i>, 224 AD3d at 669 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Wagner v Parker</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">172 AD3d 954</span>, 954). \"Summary judgment is not appropriate in a medical malpractice action where the parties adduce conflicting medical expert opinions. Such credibility issues can only be resolved by a jury\" (<i>Gupta v Lescale</i>, 224 AD3d at 669 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see McHale v Sweet</i>, 217 AD3d at 667; <i>Pirri-Logan v Pearl</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">192 AD3d 1149</span>, 1150). However, a medical expert's opinion does not raise a triable issue of fact if it is \"conclusory, speculative, or unsupported by the record\" (<i>McHale v Sweet</i>, 217 AD3d at 668; <i>see Pirri-Logan v Pearl</i>, 192 AD3d at 1150). \"'In order not to [*2]be considered speculative or conclusory, expert opinions in opposition should address specific assertions made by the movant's experts, setting forth an explanation of the reasoning and relying on specifically cited evidence in the record'\" (<i>McHale v Sweet</i>, 217 AD3d at 668, quoting <i>Templeton v Papathomas</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">208 AD3d 1268</span>, 1270-1271; <i>see Pirri-Logan v Pearl</i>, 192 AD3d at 1150).

In opposition, an expert affirmation submitted by the plaintiffs failed to raise a triable issue of fact because that expert's opinions were conclusory, speculative, and unsupported by the record, and failed to address specific assertions made by the defendants' experts (<i>see McHale v Sweet</i>, 217 AD3d at 668; <i>Pirri-Logan v Pearl</i>, 192 AD3d at 1151).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' remaining contention is without merit.</p>\n<p>MILLER, J.P., CHRISTOPHER, LANDICINO and HOM, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Derzie for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them is denied.</p>\n<p>In April 2014, the plaintiff's decedent (hereinafter the decedent) allegedly died of an aortic dissection at the defendant Maimonides Medical Center (hereinafter the hospital) after being seen in the emergency department by the defendant Alan M.

The hospital and Derzie (hereinafter together the defendants) moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them. In an order dated September 8, 2020, the Supreme Court granted the defendants' motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"A defendant moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must demonstrate the absence of any material issues of fact with respect to at least one of the elements of a cause of action alleging medical malpractice: (1) [that] the physician deviated or departed from accepted community standards of practice, or (2) that such a departure was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries\" (<i>Russell v Garafalo</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">189 AD3d 1100</span>, 1101 [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Stukas v Streiter</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5816611\"><a href=\"/opinion/5957760/stukas-v-streiter/#23\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Stukas v.

The order granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint is denied.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants to recover damages for personal injuries he allegedly sustained when he slipped and fell on a wet interior staircase on property owned by the defendants. The defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, contending, inter alia, that they maintained their property in a reasonably safe condition. The plaintiff opposed the motion. In an order dated February 27, 2024, the Supreme Court granted the motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>In a slip-and-fall case, a defendant moving for summary judgment \"has the burden of making a prima facie showing that it neither (1) affirmatively created the hazardous condition nor (2) had actual or constructive notice of the condition and a reasonable time to correct or warn about its existence\" (<i>Parietti v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5494680\"><a href=\"/opinion/5648675/parietti-v-wal-mart-stores-inc/#1137\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Parietti v.

Wood, J.), dated February 1, 2021. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging breach of contract.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff owned a wholesale and retail paint supply business and performed consulting work for projects involving coating and the surfaces underlying such coating. The plaintiff entered into several contracts to provide consultation services to the Board of Managers of Hudson Point Condominium (hereinafter the Board) in connection with a project to replace damaged wood on the exterior of buildings of the Hudson Point Condominium (hereinafter HPC) and paint the exterior of those buildings. Pursuant to the fourth contract between the parties (hereinafter the project management contract), the plaintiff would, among other things, negotiate and enter into an agreement with a contractor on behalf of the Board to perform the carpentry and painting work for the project and \"monitor and manage\" the project. In exchange, the plaintiff would be entitled to \"15% of the total invoiced amount for all work contracted for.\" After the plaintiff, on behalf of the Board, negotiated and entered into contracts for the replacement of the damaged wood and the painting of the exterior of the HPC buildings, the Board abandoned aspects of the project that required replacement of wood and painting and terminated the project management contract. Ultimately, no work was invoiced for any work pursuant to the contracts that the plaintiff procured, and those contracts were also canceled. The Board proceeded to replace the damaged wood with prepainted, prefinished material.</p>\n<p>In July 2018, the plaintiff commenced this action, inter alia, to recover damages for breach of contract, alleging that the defendants breached the project management contract by unilaterally terminating it. The defendants moved, among other things, for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging breach of contract. In an order dated February 1, 2021, the Supreme Court, inter alia, granted that branch of the defendants' motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"Contracts containing no definite term of duration are terminable at will\" (<i>Bennett v Atomic Prods. Corp.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3150304\"><a href=\"/opinion/3150304/bennett-v-atomic-products-corp/#929\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Bennett v. Atomic Products Corp.\">132 AD3d 928, 929</a></span>; <i>see Better Living Now, Inc. v Image Too, Inc.</i>, 67 AD3d [*2]940, 941). \"[I]n the absence of an express term fixing the duration of a contract, the courts may inquire into the intent of the parties and supply the missing term if a duration may be fairly and reasonably fixed by the surrounding circumstances and the parties' intent\" (<i>Venza v Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Rockville Ctr.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">235 AD3d 804</span>, 808 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Haines v City of New York</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">41 NY2d 769</span>, 772). However, \"this rule has not been, and should not be, applied to contracts of employment or exclusive agency, distributorship, or requirements contracts which have been analogized to employment contracts\" (<i>Haines v City of New York</i>, 41 NY2d at 772-773; <i>see Foster v Citrus County Land Bur.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5898754\"><a href=\"/opinion/6035676/foster-v-citrus-county-land-bureau-inc/#666\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Foster v. Citrus County Land Bureau, Inc.\">133 AD2d 665, 666</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Here, the project management contract, which the defendants submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment, did not include an express term defining its duration. The defendants established, prima facie, that the implied duration of the project management contract was the life span of the project and that the project ended when the defendants terminated a carpentry contract and abandoned their plan of replacing the damaged wood on the exterior of the HPC buildings with new wood and painting the exterior of the buildings. The Board then canceled the contracts that the plaintiff had negotiated with the outside vendors pursuant to a term in those contracts allowing for cancellation. In any event, the defendants also demonstrated, prima facie, that they did not breach the project management contract because it was in the nature of an exclusive agency contract and was therefore terminable at will (<i>see Haines v City of New York</i>, 41 NY2d at 772-773; <i>Foster v Citrus County Land Bur.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5898754\"><a href=\"/opinion/6035676/foster-v-citrus-county-land-bureau-inc/#666\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Foster v. Citrus County Land Bureau, Inc.\">133 AD2d at 666</a></span>).</p>\n<p>In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the installation of the prepainted, prefinished material on the exterior of the HPC buildings did not fall within the scope of the project contemplated by the project management contract.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging breach of contract.</p>\n<p>IANNACCI, J.P., MILLER, WAN and LANDICINO, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

Daly-Sapraicone, J.), dated November 16, 2023. The order denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the complaint and granted the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's son (hereinafter the student) enrolled at the University of Rochester (hereinafter the University) for the fall 2020 semester. The plaintiff purchased an insurance policy from the defendant that would reimburse him for the cost of tuition and other expenses in the event, inter alia, that the student \"completely withdr[e]w from school\" for a \"covered reason,\" which included a mental health condition.</p>\n<p>The student began the fall 2020 semester but failed to return after the Thanksgiving break. The plaintiff thereafter submitted a claim under the policy. The defendant disclaimed coverage on the ground, inter alia, that the student did not \"completely withdraw from school,\" as required by the policy.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for breach of the insurance contract, and moved for summary judgment on the complaint. The defendant cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. In an order dated November 16, 2023, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's motion and granted the defendant's cross-motion. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>\"An insurance agreement is subject to principles of contract interpretation\" (<i>S. Donadic, Inc. v Utica Mut. Ins. Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">230 AD3d 606</span>, 608 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"In determining an insurance coverage dispute, a court must first look to the language of the policy\" (<i>Holtzman v Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">213 AD3d 918</span>, 919). \"When the language of a contract is clear, unequivocal and unambiguous, the contract is to be interpreted by its own language\" (<i>Liptis Pharms. USA, Inc. v Liptis for Pharms. &amp; Med. Prods., SAE</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 AD3d 927</span>, 929 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"As with any contract, unambiguous provisions of an insurance contract must be [*2]given their plain and ordinary meaning, and the interpretation of such provision is a question of law for the court\" (<i>Birnkrant v Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">206 AD3d 963</span>, 964 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court properly granted the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendant established, prima facie, that the plaintiff's claim was not covered because the student did not \"completely withdraw\" from the University within the meaning of the policy, and in fact received credit for completing one course. In opposition, the plaintiff failed to either raise a triable issue of fact or to demonstrate that the policy's terms were ambiguous (<i>see Liptis Pharms. USA, Inc. v Liptis for Pharms. &amp; Med. Prods., SAE</i>, 228 AD3d at 929). For the same reasons, the court properly denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the complaint.</p>\n<p>In light of the foregoing, we need not reach the plaintiff's remaining contention.</p>\n<p>BARROS, J.P., FORD, WAN and LOVE, JJ., concur.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.

The order granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102(d) as a result of the subject accident and denied, as academic, the plaintiff's separate motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability and for leave to amend his bill of particulars.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, the defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102(d) as a result of the subject accident is denied, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Rockland County, for a determination on the merits of the plaintiff's separate motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability and for leave to amend his bill of particulars.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries that he allegedly sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102(d) as a result of the subject accident. The plaintiff opposed the motion and, in separate motions, moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability and for leave to amend his bill of particulars. In an order dated November 2, 2022, the Supreme Court granted the defendants' motion and denied, as academic, the plaintiff's motions. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge the Supreme Court's determination that the defendants met their prima facie burden of showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102(d) as a result of the accident (<i>see Toure v Avis Rent A Car Sys.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057079\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057079/toure-v-avis-rent-a-car-systems-inc/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Toure v.

Leverett, J.), entered March 2, 2021. The judgment denied the petitions and dismissed the proceedings.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p>Three groups of tenants of rent-stabilized apartments in a building owned by 150 Park, LLC (hereinafter 150 Park), separately applied to the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (hereinafter the DHCR) for a rent reduction based upon a decrease in building-wide services. Each tenant group alleged that 150 Park changed the front entrance door lock from a traditional door lock to a door lock mechanism that utilized non-duplicable keys, that 150 Park refused to provide a sufficient number of non-duplicable keys to the building entrance door to the tenants, and that the tenants were charged either $50 to $250 or $50 to $100 per additional key.</p>\n<p>In amended determinations, all dated December 12, 2018, a Rent Administrator of the DHCR found, inter alia, that 150 Park failed to provide non-duplicable building entry keys to the building in violation of the Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7\u00a7 2520.6(r) and 2523.4 and directed a reduction in the amount of rent payable to 150 Park for those tenants. Thereafter, 150 Park filed petitions for administrative review of the Rent Administrator's amended determinations. In determinations dated January 10, 2020, January 14, 2020, and January 16, 2020, a Deputy Commissioner of the DHCR denied the respective petitions for administrative review and upheld the Rent Administrator's respective amended determinations.</p>\n<p>150 Park then commenced these proceedings pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review the determinations of the Deputy Commissioner. In a judgment entered March 2, 2021, the Supreme Court denied the petitions and dismissed the proceedings. 150 Park appeals.</p>\n<p>\"In reviewing a determination of the DHCR, the court must uphold the determination unless it is arbitrary and capricious and without a rational basis\" (<i>Matter of 88-05 171, LLC v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">230 AD3d 679</span>, 680 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see</i> CPLR 7803[3]; <i>Matter of Parsons Manor, LLC v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 945</span>, 946). \"An action is arbitrary and capricious when it is taken without sound basis in reason or regard to the facts\" (<i>Matter of CHT Place, LLC v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 486</span>, 487 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"If the court finds that the determination is supported by a rational basis, it must sustain the determination even if the court concludes that it would have reached a different result than the one reached by the agency\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i> [internal quotation marks omitted]).

Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from the trial court\u2019s order designating her a\n\nvexatious litigant and denying her statement of inability to pay costs. The appellee who\n\nfiled the motion is Nicholas Denbrock, the father of Andrews\u2019s daughter. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arises from a modification suit Andrews filed pro se on December 18,\n\n2024\u2014just three weeks after the trial court rendered a final order in another modification\n\nsuit on November 26, 2024.2 Over the next two months, Andrews filed sixteen additional\n\nmotions and pleadings. These included multiple emergency motions, amended petitions,\n\nmotions to reconsider, motions to stay, and notices claiming constitutional violations.\n\nAndrews also requested electronic access to the child, moved to declare Denbrock a\n\nvexatious litigant, filed special appearances challenging jurisdiction, and demanded\n\n\u201cimmediate return of child.\u201d\n\nAndrews filed a declaration of inability to pay costs, claiming $0 monthly income,\n\n$8,165 in monthly expenses, $1,800 in assets, and $118,500 in debt.\n\nDenbrock moved to declare Andrews a vexatious litigant based on her numerous\n\nfilings. At the hearing, the trial court asked Andrews to provide documentation supporting\n\nher inability to pay. Andrews initially claimed she received no notice, then stated the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over her. When pressed again, Andrews objected and continued\n\nasserting the court lacked personal jurisdiction.\n\nThe trial court found that Andrews refused to present proof of her financial records\n\nand ordered her to pay court costs. The court granted Denbrock\u2019s vexatious litigant\n\nmotion and required Andrews to post a security bond or face dismissal with prejudice of\n\nher pending motions. The order prohibits Andrews from filing new pleadings for\n\n2 Andrews\u2019s appeal from that decision is In the Interest of E.K.D., No. 07-24-00342-CV, also\nresolved this day.\n\faffirmative relief as a pro se litigant without first obtaining permission from the local\n\nadministrative judge. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.102(a). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI. Jurisdiction\n\nDenbrock contends this Court lacks jurisdiction because the vexatious litigant\n\norder is not final. However, the Third Court of Appeals has held that interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom prefiling orders designating a person as a vexatious litigant are permissible.\n\nSerafine v. Crump, 665 S.W.3d 93, 102 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2023), rev\u2019d on other grounds,\n\n691 S.W.3d 917 (Tex. 2024). Principles of horizontal stare decisis require this Court to\n\nfollow the authority of the Third Court as if we were sitting as that court. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 41.3; Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645 S.W.3d 251, 258 (Tex. 2022). We therefore exercise\n\njurisdiction over Andrews\u2019s appeal.\n\nII. Vexatious Litigant Designation\n\nChapter 11 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code establishes procedures\n\nfor designating vexatious litigants. A court may designate a plaintiff as vexatious if the\n\nplaintiff has either: (1) commenced, prosecuted, or maintained five litigations as a pro se\n\nlitigant in seven years with additional necessary findings; or (2) after a litigation has been\n\nfinally determined against the plaintiff, repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate the\n\nsame issues against the same defendant. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.054(1),\n\n(2).\n\f We review the court\u2019s vexatious litigant determination for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSerafine, 665 S.W.3d at 105. Constitutional claims are reviewed de novo. Fontenot v.\n\nFontenot, 667 S.W.3d 894, 911 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2023, no pet.).\n\nA. Fundamental Parental Rights\n\nAndrews argues the vexatious litigant designation violates her fundamental\n\nparental rights by preventing her from filing motions to protect her child. We addressed\n\nthis argument in Byars v. Evans, concluding that requiring a parent to seek permission\n\nfrom the local administrative judge before filing affirmative pleadings does not violate due\n\nprocess because it is not an absolute denial of parental rights. No. 07-14-00064-CV,\n\n2016 Tex. App. LEXIS 201, at *12\u201314 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Jan. 8, 2016, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). Although the Third Court has not precisely addressed this issue, it has generally\n\nrecognized that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate due process. Caldwell v.\n\nZimmerman, No. 03-18-00168-CV, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Mar. 27, 2019, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nAndrews argues that because attorneys have absolute immunity for actions\n\nundertaken while representing clients, parents appearing pro se should have similar\n\nimmunity when acting in their child\u2019s best interest. This argument fails for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the prefiling order does not prohibit Andrews from filing\u2014it requires her to obtain\n\npermission from the local administrative judge before filing new pleadings for affirmative\n\nrelief. Second, Andrews misunderstands attorney immunity. Attorney immunity protects\n\nagainst civil liability to third parties, not against court authority over attorneys. Bethel v.\n\nQuilling, Selander, Lownds, Winslett & Moser, P.C., 595 S.W.3d 651, 657 (Tex. 2020)\n\f(\u201cWe have long recognized . . . that attorney immunity is not boundless.\u201d). Courts retain\n\nfull authority to sanction, hold in contempt, or discipline attorneys for inappropriate\n\nconduct. Brewer v. Lennox Hearth Products, LLC, 601 S.W.3d 704, 718 (Tex. 2020) (\u201cA\n\ncourt\u2019s inherent authority includes the power to discipline an attorney\u2019s behavior.\u201d)\n\n(cleaned up).\n\nAndrews\u2019s first issue is overruled.\n\nFirst Amendment Right to Petition\n\nAndrews\u2019s entire second issue is stated as: \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees the\n\nright to petition courts for redress (BE & K Construction Co. v. NLRB, 536 U.S. 516\n\n(2002)).\u201d This issue is insufficiently briefed. Nevertheless, the Third Court has previously\n\nheld that the vexatious litigant scheme does not violate the First Amendment right to\n\npetition. Caldwell, 2019 Tex. App. LEXIS 2339, at *5\u20136.\n\nAndrews\u2019s second issue is overruled.\n\nStatutory Requirements\n\nBy her third issue, Andrews argues she is not a \u201cplaintiff\u201d under the statute and did\n\nnot file five frivolous cases in seven years. The statute defines \u201cplaintiff\u201d as \u201can individual\n\nwho commences or maintains a litigation pro se.\u201d TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 11.001(5) (emphasis added). Andrews meets both definitions: she commenced a\n\nmodification proceeding, and she maintained litigation through repeated motions to\n\nreconsider, stay enforcement, or declare orders void.\n\f Andrews\u2019s challenge is focused on only one basis for the vexatious litigant\n\nfinding\u2014five frivolous cases in seven years; she ignores the alternative basis that she\n\nrepeatedly attempted to relitigate matters finally determined against her. See id.\n\n\u00a7 11.054(1), (2). In her reply brief, Andrews summarily argues there was no competent\n\nevidence supporting this finding. However, arguments may not be raised for the first time\n\nin a reply brief. See McFadden v. Olesky, 517 S.W.3d 287, 293 n.3 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin\n\n2017, pet. denied).\n\nAndrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nInability to Pay\n\nBy her fourth issue, Andrews argues the trial court erred by denying her statement\n\nof inability to pay costs and failing to enter findings of fact. Andrews contends her affidavit\n\nconclusively established her inability to pay and was not contradicted by other evidence.\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 permits a party to file a sworn statement of\n\ninability to afford court costs. When the statement is contested, the trial court may require\n\nthe declarant to prove inability to pay at an evidentiary hearing with at least ten days of\n\nnotice. TEX. R. CIV. P. 145. At the hearing, \u201cthe burden is on the declarant to prove the\n\ninability to afford costs.\u201d Id.\n\nThe test for indigence is whether the record shows \u201cby a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the applicant would be unable to pay the costs . . . if [s]he really wanted to\n\nand made a good-faith effort to do so.\u201d Higgins v. Randall Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Off., 257 S.W.3d\n\n684, 686 (Tex. 2008) (cleaned up). We review for an abuse of discretion. Henderson v.\n\fArabzadegan, No. 03-24-00313-CV, 2024 Tex. App. LEXIS 5919, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin Aug. 16, 2024, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nThe trial court provided Andrews with notice and asked her to bring documentation\n\nsupporting her indigency affidavit. Andrews refused to provide any documentation,\n\ninstead repeatedly asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction. Andrews\u2019s affidavit also\n\ncontained contradictory information: she claimed $0 monthly income and only $1,800 in\n\nassets while reporting $8,000 in monthly expenses. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in requiring Andrews to pay court costs.\n\nAndrews also complains the trial court failed to make findings of fact mandated by\n\nRule 145. See id. R. 145(f)(2). However, the trial court issued its findings seven days\n\nafter Andrews filed her brief, and she made no request to supplement her brief. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.7.\n\nAndrews also makes a conclusory argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling violates the\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. This argument consists of a\n\nsingle quote from a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Missing from the argument is any\n\nanalysis of how the trial court\u2019s ruling, or requiring her to pay court costs, violates her\n\nrights. Accordingly, this argument is waived for inadequate briefing. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex. 2018).\n\nAndrews\u2019s fourth issue is overruled.3\n\n3 In a fifth issue, Andrews challenges what she calls the trial court\u2019s \u201cflawed rulings.\u201d Her argument\ncontains no citations to the record, applicable law, or authority. Andrews fails to identify which specific\nruling she challenges, what relief she seeks, or how any relief could be granted. This issue is waived for\ninadequate briefing. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1; RSL Funding, LLC v. Newsome, 569 S.W.3d 116, 126 (Tex.\n\f CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all of Andrews\u2019s issues, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n2018) (\u201cA brief must provide citations or argument and analysis for the contentions and failure to do this\ncan result in waiver.\u201d).\n\n8"

Starritt-Burnett, Presiding\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n MEMORANDUM OPINION\n and DOSS and YARBROUGH, JJ.\n\nAppellant Kailyn Andrews appeals from a final order in a suit affecting the parent-\n\nchild relationship regarding her child, E.K.D., with Appellee Nicholas Denbrock. Andrews\n\nraises three issues: (1) the trial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised\n\nvisitation; (2) the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption favoring a standard\n\npossession order; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in determining her net\n\nresources for child support were subject to the maximum amount. We affirm.\n\n1 This appeal was originally filed in the Third Court of Appeals and was transferred to this Court by\n\na docket-equalization order of the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f BACKGROUND\n\nThis case began with two registered foreign orders from Nevada that gave the\n\nparties \u201cjoint legal custody,\u201d a week-on/week-off possession schedule, and a mutual\n\nbehavior order. Denbrock filed suit to modify the Nevada order in Texas, requesting that\n\nhe have the exclusive right to designate the child\u2019s residence and to make all medical and\n\neducational decisions concerning the child. Andrews counterpetitioned for similar relief.\n\nThe matter was tried to the bench over four trial days across six months. The trial\n\ncourt appointed both parties as joint managing conservators but awarded Denbrock\n\nexclusive rights including the right to designate the child\u2019s residence. Andrews received\n\nonly supervised visitation and was ordered to pay $1,500 monthly in child support.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPossession and Access\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s supervised visitation order in her first two\n\nissues. We review a trial court\u2019s modification of conservatorship or possession for an\n\nabuse of discretion. In re J.A.J., 243 S.W.3d 611, 616 (Tex. 2007). \u201cThe best interest of\n\nthe child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues\n\nof conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d\n\n211, 218 (Tex. 2021) (quoting TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.002). Conservatorship suits\n\nare \u201cintensely fact driven.\u201d Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 19 (Tex. 2002). For this reason,\n\n\u201cthe trial court is in the best position to \u2018observe the demeanor and personalities of the\n\nwitnesses and can \u201cfeel\u201d the forces, powers, and influences that cannot be discerned by\n\nmerely reading the record.\u2019\u201d In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting Echols v. Olivarez,\n\f85 S.W.3d 475, 477 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2002, no pet.)). The factfinder \u201cis the sole judge\n\nof the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d Golden Eagle\n\nArchery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion by acting \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules\n\nor principles\u201d or arbitrarily or unreasonably. In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218 (quoting\n\nWorford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam)). A trial court also\n\nabuses its discretion \u201cif it imposes restrictions that exceed those required to protect the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest.\u201d In re H.D.C., 474 S.W.3d 758, 764 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2014, no pet.); see also In re J.J.R.S., 627 S.W.3d at 218\u201319.\n\nUnder this standard, challenges to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nare not independent grounds of error but instead are factors used to assess whether the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion. Zeifman v. Michels, 212 S.W.3d 582, 587 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAustin 2006, pet. denied). An appellate court considers (1) whether the trial court had\n\nsufficient information on which to exercise its discretion and (2) whether the trial court\n\nerred in its application of discretion. Id. at 588. A trial court does not abuse its discretion\n\nif there is some substantive, probative evidence to support its decision. Id. at 587.\n\nAndrews argues that under the Holley and Family Code\u2019s best-interest factors, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by requiring supervised visits. She also challenges the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a standard possession\n\norder. See Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976);2 TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.\n\n2 The Holley factors include: (1) the desires of the child; (2) the emotional and physical needs of\n\nthe child now and in the future; (3) the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future;\n(4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (5) the programs available to assist these\nindividuals to promote the best interest of the child; (6) the plans for the child by the individuals seeking\n\f\u00a7 153.134(a).3 Andrews contends the trial court based its ruling on a \u201cmere failure to\n\nfollow a court order\u201d rather than the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe trial court found Andrews violated court orders approximately two dozen times.\n\nSome violations were relatively minor, such as failing to provide her new address in a\n\ntimely manner. Other violations were more significant, including going out of state,\n\nrefusing to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s periods of possession, and making\n\ndemeaning remarks about Denbrock during electronic communications with the child.\n\nThe trial court also found that Andrews had refused to identify herself at a hearing and\n\nsent ex parte communications to the trial court through social media. Additionally,\n\nAndrews tried to remove the child from Denbrock\u2019s car without permission during what\n\nwas supposed to be supervised visitation. Andrews does not challenge any of these\n\nfindings, and the evidence supports them.\n\nAdditional evidence at trial included various filings by Andrews, including a \u201cWrit of\n\nDivinia,\u201d and a notice that Andrews placed the child into a trust. Andrews testified she\n\ncustody; (7) the stability of the home or proposed placement; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent which\nmay indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and (9) any excuse for the acts\nor omissions of the parent. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976).\n 3 The statutory best-interest factors include:\n\n(1) whether the physical, psychological, or emotional needs and development of the child\n will benefit from the appointment of joint managing conservators; (2) the ability of the\n parents to give first priority to the welfare of the child and reach shared decisions in the\n child\u2019s best interest; (3) whether each parent can encourage and accept a positive\n relationship between the child and the other parent; (4) whether both parents participated\n in child rearing before the filing of the suit; (5) the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019\n residences; (6) if the child is 12 years of age or older, the child\u2019s preference, if any,\n regarding the person to have the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the\n child; and (7) any other relevant factor.\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a).\n\fagrees to follow court orders \u201cwhen it\u2019s in the best interest of [the child].\u201d She indicated\n\nthat she believed the original Nevada order violated due process and was illegal, which\n\nis why she did not believe she needed to follow it.\n\nThe Holley and statutory best-interest factors are neither exhaustive nor\n\ndeterminative. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.134(a)(7) (permitting a trial court to\n\nconsider any other relevant factors); In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 27 (Tex. 2002) (the Holley\n\nfactors are not exhaustive and some cases may not have evidence of some factors at\n\nall). Courts have considered a parent\u2019s conduct that interferes with the other parent\u2019s\n\nrelationship with their child. See Allen v. Allen, 475 S.W.3d 453, 458 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.); In re Marriage of Chandler, 914 S.W.2d 252, 255 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAmarillo 1996, no writ).\n\nThe record contains significant testimony and evidence that Andrews interfered\n\nwith Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child. The evidence reveals that Andrews:\n\n\u2022 Sometimes refused to turn the child over during Denbrock\u2019s\n scheduled possession periods;\n\n\u2022 Made negative comments about Denbrock to the child and called\n Denbrock and his family \u201cdemons,\u201d \u201cpsychos,\u201d and \u201cevil monkeys\u201d;\n\n\u2022 Exhibited suicidal ideation and paranoid beliefs about being followed\n and monitored;\n\n\u2022 Engaged in \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d by seeking treatment from multiple\n physicians until receiving preferred responses, often without\n consulting Denbrock;\n\n\u2022 After temporary orders gave Denbrock medical decision-making\n authority, cancelled the child\u2019s four-year check-up and dental\n appointments; and\n\f \u2022 Attempted to open Denbrock\u2019s car doors to obtain the child when no\n supervisor was present, which severely upset the child.\n\nAlthough some of the Holley and statutory best-interest factors could have\n\nsupported a different outcome, that does not mean that the trial court\u2019s order constitutes\n\nan abuse of discretion. The trial court considered Andrews\u2019s extensive history of\n\ninterfering with Denbrock\u2019s relationship with the child, as well as his efforts to obtain\n\nproper healthcare for the child, and Andrews\u2019s position regarding following court orders\n\nthat she deems not to be in the child\u2019s best interest. On this record, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by limiting Andrews\u2019s periods of possession and\n\naccess and requiring them to be supervised. Andrews\u2019s first and second issues are\n\noverruled.\n\nChild Support\n\nAndrews challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that her net monthly resources\n\nwere $9,200\u2014the statutory maximum\u2014resulting in a $1,500 monthly support obligation.\n\nChild support determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, with legal\n\nand factual sufficiency serving as relevant factors rather than independent grounds for\n\nreversal. Banakar v. Krause, 674 S.W.3d 564, 573 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2023,\n\nno pet.). Net resources include income from various sources, including trust income and\n\n\u201call other income actually received.\u201d TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 154.062(b). Trial courts may\n\ncalculate net resources based on imprecise information, particularly when a party fails to\n\nprovide required documentation. In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d 660, 666 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso\n\n2011, no pet.).\n\f Andrews challenges the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that she made\n\n$20,000 in monthly income. Andrews testified that she receives income from her father\u2019s\n\nbusiness that takes in $20,000 to $30,000 monthly, though she claimed her father pays\n\nher only $2,000 to $4,000 monthly \u201cfor the extra stuff.\u201d Notably, though, Andrews refused\n\nto provide trust documents, bank records, or other financial information despite discovery\n\nrequests and a court order compelling production.\n\nHowever, the trial court could also assess Andrews\u2019s credibility regarding her\n\nincome through the other evidence of her expenses: she reported approximately $7,000\n\nin monthly expenses for rent, car payments, and therapy alone\u2014well beyond the $2,000\n\nto $4,000 she claimed to receive. The trial court was free to disbelieve Andrews\u2019s\n\ntestimony regarding her income. See In re N.T., 335 S.W.3d at 666. Moreover, any error\n\nthat the trial court could have made would be the fault of Andrews by contumaciously\n\nrefusing to provide the necessary information to appropriately set child support, despite\n\ndiscovery requests and an order to compel. Accordingly, we conclude that there was at\n\nleast some evidence of a probative and substantive character supporting the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision and determine that the trial court made a reasonable decision based on that\n\nevidence. See Banakar, 674 S.W.3d at 573. Andrews\u2019s third issue is overruled.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nLawrence M. Doss\n Justice\n\n7"

See TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 73.001. In the\nevent of any conflict, we apply the transferor court\u2019s case law. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\n2 TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1),(b)(2)(A), (B). Appellant pleaded true to the enhancement\n\nand habitual offender provisions. The range of punishment applicable to Appellant was enhanced to a term\nof confinement of \u201clife, or for any term of not more than 99 years or less than 25 years.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE\nANN. \u00a7 12.42(d).\n\fjury assessed a punishment of 40 years of confinement for each conviction. The trial\n\ncourt sentenced Appellant accordingly and ordered the sentences run concurrently. We\n\noverrule Appellant\u2019s two issues and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAppellant and the complainant, Marisa Espinoza, had been in an on-and-off\n\nromantic relationship since 1996. They have two children together, ages 29 and 11.\n\nEspinoza testified they had conducted a marriage ceremony but never filed official\n\npaperwork, and she would introduce Appellant as both her boyfriend or husband. At the\n\ntime of the charged offense, Appellant had been living with Espinoza for about eight\n\nmonths after being released from custody in January 2022.\n\nOn September 9, 2022, Appellant and Espinoza had been arguing all day. The\n\nargument intensified after Appellant took Espinoza\u2019s truck and was gone longer than\n\nexpected, which angered Espinoza. She began \u201cblowing up his phone\u201d;3 he would not\n\nanswer her calls. When Appellant returned, the discussion escalated, with Appellant\n\ncalling Espinoza names and then engaging in physical violence.\n\nAppellant grabbed Espinoza by her hair and pulled her inside the house. Once\n\ninside the kitchen and dining room area, Appellant struck her in the face and head area\n\nwith his hands. Espinoza testified he hit her \u201cat least three times\u201d with a closed fist.\n\nAppellant also grabbed Espinoza by the throat with his left hand, applying pressure with\n\na force that caused her to feel she \u201cwas being suffocated. Like . . . they\u2019re cutting off your\n\n3 This is a colloquial expression meaning repeatedly calling or texting someone, often in an urgent\n\nor persistent manner. See, e.g., K\u2019ron, Round of Applause, (Atlantic Records 2020). (\u201cShe blowin\u2019 up my\nphone / Won\u2019t leave me alone / She get on my nerves / Where would I be without her?\u201d).\n\fairway.\u201d Meanwhile, Appellant told Espinoza \u201che hates [her], he\u2019s going to kill [her], stuff\n\nlike that.\u201d Espinoza had difficulty breathing, was \u201cscared,\u201d and needed \u201cto get help.\u201d\n\nWhen Espinoza\u2019s brother walked into the room, Appellant released his grip.\n\nEspinoza immediately ran to the front door and called 911. Espinoza\u2019s voice was\n\nnoticeably raspy as she tried to catch her breath. Police officers responding to the scene\n\nobserved visible injuries on Espinoza\u2019s neck, photographed the injuries, and arrested\n\nAppellant for assault by strangulation.\n\nTwo days later, Appellant telephoned Espinoza from jail and told her to instruct\n\nprosecutors to drop the charges. During this call, he admitted he grabbed her by the\n\n\u201cpescuezo,\u201d the Spanish word for \u201cneck.\u201d\n\nANALYSIS\n\nFirst Issue: Double Jeopardy\n\nAppellant argues his convictions for both assault family violence by occlusion and\n\nassault family violence with a prior conviction constitute multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. He\n\nacknowledges the remedy for the alleged violation would be to \u201cretain the conviction with\n\nthe most serious punishment and vacate any remaining convictions\u201d that violate double\n\njeopardy. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent 40-year terms of imprisonment for both\n\nconvictions.\n\f(a) Preservation of Error\n\nThe State argues Appellant failed to preserve this issue. But a double-jeopardy\n\nclaim may be raised for the first time on appeal when (1) the undisputed facts show the\n\nviolation is clearly apparent on the record\u2019s face, and (2) enforcement of procedural\n\ndefault serves no legitimate state interest. Langs v. State, 183 S.W.3d 680, 687 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2006).\n\nWe hold these conditions are met. A claim is apparent on the face of the record if\n\nits resolution does not require additional proceedings to introduce more evidence. Ex\n\nparte Denton, 399 S.W.3d 540, 544 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy\n\nclaim does not require additional proceedings. Moreover, the State presents no\n\npersuasive argument why enforcing procedural default serves any legitimate state\n\ninterest under these circumstances. See Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889, 892 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d); Anderson v. State, No. 10-01-00306-CV, 2003 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 6008, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco July 2, 2003, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n(b) Applicable Law\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\nBrown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977); Ramos v. State, 636 S.W.3d 646, 651 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021). Multiple-punishment violations occur when the same conduct is\n\npunished under distinct statutes where the Legislature intended punishment only once.\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nHere, Appellant contends that the Legislature intended only one punishment,\n\narguing section 22.01(a) is the lesser-included offense of section 22.01(b)(2)(B)\n\f(impeding normal breathing or circulation), which is merely an enhancement of the same\n\ncriminal conduct. \u201cA multiple-punishments violation can arise either in the context of\n\nlesser-included offenses, where the same conduct is punished under a greater and a\n\nlesser-included offense, and when the same conduct is punished under two distinct\n\nstatutes where the Legislature only intended for the conduct to be punished once.\u201d\n\nGarfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nAccordingly, we look to the statute\u2019s text to determine legislative intent. Stevenson,\n\n499 S.W.3d at 850. It is undisputed that occlusion assault (Count I) and assault family\n\nviolence with a prior (Count II) have different elements and that the State proved these\n\nelements at trial. Occlusion assault requires the State prove that a defendant impeded\n\nthe normal breathing or blood circulation of the complainant, while this element is not\n\nrequired for assault family violence with a prior conviction.\n\nThis distinction is of critical importance. In Ortiz v. State, 623 S.W.3d 804 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2021), the Court of Criminal Appeals addressed whether bodily-injury assault\n\ncan be a lesser-included offense of occlusion assault and answered \u201cNo.\u201d The Court\n\nemployed an \u201callowable unit of prosecution\u201d analysis to examine what facts are required\n\nto prove each offense. Occlusion assault requires proof of a specific injury\u2014\u201cimpeding\n\nnormal breathing or circulation of the blood\u201d\u2014whereas simple assault requires proof of\n\nany \u201cbodily injury,\u201d broadly defined as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical\n\ncondition.\u201d Id. at 806\u201307. While impeding breathing constitutes bodily injury, it is a distinct\n\ntype that excludes other injuries. The Court illustrated this principle with an analogy:\n\nImpeding is exclusive of other injuries in the same way that a square is\n exclusive of other rectangles: A square is a rectangle, but other rectangles\n\f are not squares; specifying \u201csquare\u201d excludes non-square rectangles; and\n specifying \u201cimpeding\u201d excludes non-impeding injuries.\n\nFor example, if a defendant were charged with occlusion assault, and the\n evidence showed that he stomped on the complainant\u2019s foot and caused\n pain, that assault would not be included in the charged offense because a\n non-impeding injury is not required to prove occlusion assault.\n\nId. at 807. The Court explained that even a non-impeding injury inflicted on the neck\n\nwould not be proven by the same facts needed to prove occlusion assault. If pinching the\n\nneck caused pain but did not impede normal breathing or blood circulation, the assault\n\nwould not be included because the assault by pinching would require proof of a different\n\ninjury than impeding.\n\nThe facts in this appeal are very similar to those in Brown v. State, 640 S.W.3d 889\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Brown involved a defendant who committed both\n\nstrangulation and other assaultive acts against his intimate partner during the same\n\nepisode. The defendant was convicted of both occlusion assault of a household/family\n\nmember and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe Tenth Court of Appeals relied on Ortiz\u2019s methodology to hold that convictions\n\nfor both offenses from the same incident did not violate double jeopardy. Using unit-of-\n\nprosecution analysis, the court determined that both result-oriented offenses have distinct\n\ngravamina: impeding is the focus of occlusion assault and defines its allowable unit of\n\nprosecution while excluding other injuries, whereas bodily-injury assault lacks a statutorily\n\nspecified injury. Id. at 893. The court emphasized that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in\n\noccluding the complainant\u2019s breathing or blood circulation were separate from other\n\nassaultive acts he committed against her . . . [even] [t]hough the offenses may have\n\foccurred during the same criminal episode . . . .\u201d Id. at 894. Therefore, the court reasoned\n\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. Id. at 893\u201394.\n\nAppellant argues that Brown\u2019s \u201cconclusions are incorrect and both offenses are\n\nsubject to double jeopardy protection.\u201d But as a transferee court from the Tenth Court of\n\nAppeals, we are required to follow Brown\u2019s holding, as that constitutes binding precedent\n\non that court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3; Baker v. State, No. 07-22-00286-CR, 2023 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 5857, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo Aug. 7, 2023, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cTexas courts follow\n\nvertical stare decisis (lower courts must follow the precedents of all higher courts) and\n\nhorizontal stare decisis (three-judge panels must follow materially indistinguishable\n\ndecisions of earlier panels of the same court unless a higher authority has superseded\n\nthat prior decision).\u201d Earl v. State, No. 03-23-00427-CR, 2025 Tex. App. LEXIS 4527, at\n\n*9\u201310 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin June 27, 2025, no pet. h.) (citing Mitschke v. Borromeo, 645\n\nS.W.3d 251, 256 (Tex. 2022)).\n\n(c) Application to this Case\n\nThese binding decisions establish a clear rule: Espinoza\u2019s injury from occlusion\n\nassault was not merely different in degree from other assault injuries she received\u2014it\n\nwas different in kind. Ortiz, 623 S.W.3d at 809; see also McCall v. State, 635 S.W.3d 261,\n\n268 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2021, pet. ref\u2019d). Though Appellant\u2019s offenses occurred during\n\nthe same criminal episode, they are not the same offense for Double Jeopardy purposes\n\nbecause they involve different statutorily-specified injuries requiring proof of different\n\nfacts. Brown, 640 S.W.3d at 894.\n\nWe overrule Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\fSecond Issue: Evidence of Prior Domestic Violence\n\nIn his second issue, Appellant argues the trial court erred by permitting Espinoza\n\nto testify about prior instances of domestic violence between her and Appellant.\n\nTo preserve error regarding evidence admission, a party must object each time\n\ninadmissible evidence is offered, obtain a running objection, or request a hearing outside\n\nthe jury\u2019s presence. Martinez v. State, 98 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); see\n\nalso TEX. R. EVID. 103(b). Here, Appellant voiced a relevance objection when the State\n\nbegan examining Espinoza about past domestic violence episodes, which the trial court\n\noverruled. He did not reurge that objection or request a running objection thereafter.\n\nAdditional evidence of the 2014 judgment documenting Appellant\u2019s guilty plea for assault\n\nfamily violence was admitted without objection. Espinoza also testified without objection\n\nthat she was the victim of that assault and that Appellant routinely asked her to drop\n\ncharges after other past incidents.\n\nMoreover, significant evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt was admitted beyond the prior\n\nviolence testimony. The jury also heard Appellant\u2019s recorded jail call admitting he grabbed\n\nher neck and related testimony.4 It heard Espinoza\u2019s raspy voice on her 911 call.\n\nEspinoza described how Appellant pushed her down, hit her, and grabbed her throat, and\n\nshowed the jury photographic evidence of her injuries.\n\nBecause Appellant did not continue objecting, request a running objection, or seek\n\na hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence, any error was not preserved.

Compl. [Dkt. # 1] at 1. Over the course of litigation, ATF produced documents\n\nin response to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request in thirteen separate productions. See Joint Status Reports\n\n[Dkt. ## 8\u20139, 11\u201319]. But in its final production, the agency inadvertently produced documents\n\nto plaintiffs showing information that had been marked for redaction under FOIA\u2019s statutory\n\nexemptions, but was not actually redacted. Joint Status Report [Dkt # 19] \u00b6 4. The Court issued\n\na temporary protective order sequestering the inadvertently produced records until it could\n\ndetermine whether the information the agency marked for redaction fell properly within the\n\nclaimed FOIA exemptions. Temporary Protective Order (Oct. 30, 2023) [Dkt. # 30] (\u201cTPO\u201d) at 1.\n\nNow before the Court is ATF\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J.\n\n[Dkt. # 32] (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.\u201d), and plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary protective order.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20134. On April 28,\n\n2021, they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n\nFirearms & Explosives seeking records related to the agency\u2019s use of the National Instant Criminal\n\nBackground Check System (\u201cNICS\u201d). See Ex. A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] (\u201cEx. A\u201d); Compl. \u00b6 8.\n\nThe NICS is the system used \u201cto determine if an individual is prohibited from purchasing a\n\nfirearm.\u201d Second Decl. of Ginae Barnett [Dkt. # 32-3] (\u201cBarnett Decl.\u201d) \u00b6 14. Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs requested:\n\n(a) records showing the number of individuals for whom ATF is requesting\n or has requested NICS monitoring, during the 12-month period preceding\n this request;\n\n(b) records demonstrating the purpose(s) for which each individual has been\n monitored (i.e., suspected straw purchases, false statements, etc.);\n\n(c) records discussing the legality of NICS monitoring;\n\n(d) records demonstrating the number of individuals prosecuted as a result\n of being \u201cmonitored\u201d by the program (criminal case docket numbers will\n suffice); and\n\n(e) records demonstrating any reported unlawful or otherwise improper\n misuse of NICS monitoring by ATF personnel (or contractors of ATF).\n\fEx. A at 2. ATF acknowledged plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request by a letter dated August 24, 2021, see\n\nEx. B to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-2], and it \u201cproceeded to search for responsive records.\u201d Barnett\n\nDecl. \u00b6 4.\n\nHaving received no further response from ATF, on November 5, 2021, plaintiffs filed this\n\nsuit to compel the agency to release the requested information. Compl. at 1, 5. ATF answered the\n\ncomplaint and then, over the next year-and-a-half, it reviewed 4,559 potentially responsive\n\ndocuments, and it \u201cproduced all responsive records in 13 monthly productions.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 6;\n\nsee Def.\u2019s Answer [Dkt. # 5].\n\nOn September 6, 2023, ATF emailed its thirteenth production to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. Id. \u00b6 8.\n\nIt was compromised of \u201ca cover letter and a PDF file\u201d consisting of 115-pages. Id. Like the\n\nprevious twelve productions, the production contained emails in which ATF agents submitted\n\n\u201cNICS monitoring\u201d requests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). Id. \u00b6 13. The emails\n\nshowed the \u201cnames, email addresses, and sometimes telephone numbers\u201d of the ATF agents, FBI\n\nagents, and staff involved. Id. \u00b6 15. Most of the emails also included \u201cthe underlying investigative\n\ntarget\u2019s name\u201d and discussion of the investigation. Id. \u00b6 15. And each monitoring request also\n\nincluded a \u201cstandard form\u201d regarding the individual, or \u201csubject,\u201d for whom monitoring was\n\nrequested. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. The forms enabled the requesters to input the following categories of\n\ninformation:\n\n\u2022 Submit date\n \u2022 Requester\u2019s name, contact number, and e-mail address\n \u2022 Case number\n \u2022 Subject\u2019s name, date of birth, gender, race, social security number, state\n of residence, and place of birth\n \u2022 FBI number\n \u2022 State record number\n \u2022 Monitoring time frame\n \u2022 Suspected violation(s) of the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act\n \u2022 Detailed information about why the subject is under investigation\n\f \u2022 Detailed information about the investigation. What does the requester\n know and how do they know it?\n\nId. \u00b6 15. The last two bullet points on the form calling for \u201cdetailed information\u201d allow the\n\nrequester to provide \u201cnarrative responses,\u201d and some of the responses in the produced documents\n\nincluded: \u201cinformation furnished by witnesses or confidential sources,\u201d id. \u00b6 15; information from\n\nthe agency\u2019s \u201cFirearms Tracing System\u201d database, id. \u00b6 19; and information about the \u201cspecific\n\nlaw enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the investigation. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn advance of the production, ATF marked multiple pieces of information for redaction\n\npursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Barnett Decl. \u00b6 16. Under Exemption\n\n3, it marked for redaction the \u201crecords of specific firearms traces\u201d from the Firearms Tracing\n\nSystem database. Id. \u00b6 19. Under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), it marked for redaction the\n\n\u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d of ATF agents, FBI agents, agency personnel, and the\n\nsubjects, associates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nFinally, under Exemption 7(E), it marked for redaction information revealing \u201cspecific law\n\nenforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used during the agency\u2019s investigations. Id. \u00b6 31.\n\nIn accordance with the procedure utilized in the previous productions, ATF marked the\n\nrecords to be included in the thirteenth production with \u201cred boxes\u201d outlining the information it\n\nintended to redact. Id. \u00b6 7. The material in each red box was overlaid with text indicating the\n\napplicable FOIA exemption. Id. The procedure to be followed required the processor to select\n\n\u201cApply\u201d to create a new, redacted document. Id. Although the separate, redacted document was\n\ncreated for the thirteenth production, the agency inadvertently emailed plaintiffs a copy of the\n\nprevious version that still showed red boxes outlining the redactions and the contents of the boxes,\n\nnot the version that actually applied the redactions. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7\u20138.\n\f On September 8, 2023, two days after the agency released the thirteenth production,\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked ATF\u2019s counsel in an email, \u201c[c]an I get a redacted version of the final\n\nProduction #13?\u201d Attachment B to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] (emphasis in original). Fifteen\n\nminutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cIt seems there was an inadvertent production. Would\n\nyou please delete any copy that you may have downloaded? ATF will send you a replacement\n\nproduction.\u201d Attachment C to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. Nine minutes later, ATF\u2019s counsel sent\n\n\u201cthe proper version of production 13,\u201d containing the permanently applied redactions. Attachment\n\nD to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3].\n\nOn September 10, ATF\u2019s counsel asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to \u201cconfirm in writing that [he]\n\ndeleted any copy of the inadvertent production,\u201d noting the \u201csignificant privacy interests in the\n\nmaterial[.]\u201d Attachment E to Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3]. The next day, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n\nresponded tartly: \u201cI do not have time today to consider much less respond to this request to delete\n\nwhat I was sent.\u201d Attachment F to Barnett Decl. [Dkt # 32-3] at 1. ATF\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cif you\n\ndo not confirm deletion of the materials, ATF plans to move for a protective order.\u201d Id.\n\nThe next day, a different attorney emailed ATF\u2019s counsel to say that he would \u201cbe\n\nrepresenting\u201d plaintiffs with respect to the \u201cplanned motion for protective order.\u201d Attachment H\n\nto Barnett Decl. [Dkt. # 32-3] at 1. At that point, plaintiffs had both the redacted version and the\n\ninadvertently unredacted version of the thirteenth production in its possession, and one could easily\n\nascertain whether anything had been omitted that did not fall within a FOIA exemption. Yet\n\ncounsel took the following position:\n\n[O]ur review of these documents demonstrates that they may, like other\n documents received in this FOIA, and perhaps to a greater extent, reveal\n unauthorized or even illegal activity by ATF and the FBI, violating statutory\n requirements and jeopardizing the constitutional rights of federal firearms\n licensees and other Americans. Thus, we are concerned that, if we agree to\n your proposal and destroy the documents in our possession, those\n\f unauthorized or even illegal activities will be covered up by ATF. We do\n not agree voluntarily to be complicit in such a coverup. You have asked for\n our position on a protective order. We oppose . . . . [T]he error here is the\n government\u2019s alone, and we will resist any effort to make it appear that we\n have done anything wrong, or that ATF is somehow the \u201cgood guy\u201d here\n by, under the guise of protecting certain private information that it\n negligently disclosed, attempting to coverup its potential violations of\n statutes and constitutional rights.\n\nId. at 2.\n\nOn September 13, ATF moved for a protective order to shield the \u201cmaterial inadvertently\n\nproduced\u201d from dissemination, disclosure, or use until the Court decided the merits of its FOIA\n\nexemptions. Def.\u2019s Expedited Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 20] at 1, 7\u20138. Plaintiffs opposed\n\nthe motion. See Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. for Protective Order [Dkt. # 28] (\u201cPls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective\n\nOrder\u201d). The Court granted the motion, and it ordered plaintiffs to \u201ctemporarily sequester\u201d the\n\ninadvertently produced file until a decision regarding the redactions could be made on the merits.\n\nTPO at 1.1 Defendant moved for summary judgment on December 8, and the parties fully briefed\n\nthe motion. See Def.\u2019s Mot.; Pls.\u2019 Resp.; Def.\u2019s Reply.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, ATF filed a notice of supplemental authority pointing to the D.C.\n\nCircuit\u2019s decision in Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police, 126 F.4th 708\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2025), and the parties were directed to file submissions addressing its impact on the\n\ndispute. See Def.\u2019s Notice of Suppl. Authority [Dkt. # 35]; Minute Order (Mar. 12, 2025); Pls.\u2019\n\nSuppl. Mem. [Dkt. # 37]; Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. [Dkt. # 38]. Plaintiffs also moved to lift the Court\u2019s\n\nprotective order in light of the Circuit\u2019s ruling. See Pls.\u2019 Mot. That motion is also fully briefed.\n\nSee Def.\u2019s Opp.; Pls.\u2019 Reply. The Court then ordered ATF to submit the unredacted thirteenth\n\n1 The order did not limit plaintiffs\u2019 use of the version of the thirteenth production with the\nredactions properly applied.\n\fproduction to the Court for in camera review, see Minute Order (Apr. 11, 2025), and ATF\n\nsubmitted the materials under seal. See Sealed Doc. [Dkt. # 41].\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as\n\nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\n\nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat summary\n\njudgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue for trial.\u201d Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if a\n\nreasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it is capable\n\nof affecting the outcome of the litigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236,\n\n1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In assessing a party\u2019s motion, the court must \u201cview the facts and draw\n\nreasonable inferences \u2018in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment\n\nmotion.\u2019\u201d Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States\n\nv. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWhen a federal agency receives a request for records under the Freedom of Information\n\nAct, the statute requires it to disclose the requested information unless it falls into one of FOIA\u2019s\n\fnine exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(3)(A), (b)(1)\u2013(9). In a \u201ctypical FOIA case concerning the\n\nwithholding of requested documents,\u201d the court decides \u201cthe applicability of a claimed FOIA\n\nexemption,\u201d Al-Fayed v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 254 F.3d 300, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and if it\n\ndetermines that the information does not fall within the exemption, the requester is entitled to it.\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\n\nThis is not the typical case. During the process of responding to plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA request,\n\nthe agency inadvertently produced a set of documents that were marked for redaction, but not\n\nactually redacted. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 7. The agency maintains in its motion for summary judgment\n\nthat all of the information designated for redaction falls within Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and\n\n7(E), Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315, and plaintiffs do not dispute that assertion. Plaintiffs \u201ctake no position\u201d\n\non the FOIA exemptions; indeed, they announce that they \u201chave no interest in the vast majority of\n\nthe . . . information ATF disclosed.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. In other words, plaintiffs do not claim that\n\nthey are entitled to any of the information the agency meant to withhold, and having seen it, they\n\nare not suggesting that they have any reason to disseminate the bulk of it further. Nonetheless,\n\nthey object to any order extending restrictions on the use of the material on principle.\n\nThe agency asks the Court to order plaintiffs to: (1) \u201csequester the September 6, 2023,\n\ninadvertently produced FOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate,\n\ndisclose, or use for any purpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent opinion in Human Rights Defense Center v. United\n\nStates Park Police bars the Court from ordering that relief and requires it to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order. See Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem.; Pls.\u2019 Mot. They also contend that an order sequestering\n\nthe inadvertent production would constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 27\u201332.\n\f The Court finds that defendant\u2019s motion and supporting declaration and its own review of\n\nthe materials in camera confirm that all the information marked for redaction in the inadvertent\n\nproduction falls properly within a FOIA exemption. Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment in its favor will be granted on the propriety of the exemptions. This also means that the\n\nCourt\u2019s interim order restricting the use of the information that defendant meant to redact until the\n\nlegitimacy of the redactions had been determined expires under its own terms, TPO at 1,2 and that\n\nthe challenge to that order is now moot.\n\nThe Court also finds that it has equitable authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested relief to bar\n\nplaintiffs from using or disseminating the inadvertently produced information. Plaintiffs have\n\nalready agreed to destroy the majority of the information at issue, which is properly exempt under\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D). Pls.\u2019 Reply at 23. As for the rest of the information, Human Rights\n\nDefense Center v. United States Park Police is distinguishable and does not control the instant\n\nsuit, and both Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent regarding the Court\u2019s equitable authority\n\nunder FOIA support a remedy that bars the use of FOIA-exempted information.\n\nI. All of the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n exemptions claimed by the ATF.\n\nThe ATF marked several sets of information for redaction in the thirteenth production, and\n\nits motion for summary judgment argues that those redactions were proper under FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4\u201315. Plaintiffs have \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated\n\n2 Plaintiffs argued that the Court lacked authority to let the temporary protective order stand.\nSee Pls.\u2019 Suppl.

Id. at 6\u201333; see id. at\n\n6 (\u201cATF spends the majority of its briefing arguing that various redactions . . . would have been\n\nappropriate under various FOIA exemptions . . . . Plaintiffs take no position with respect to these\n\narguments.\u201d).\n\nAlthough plaintiffs make no effort to challenge the agency\u2019s FOIA exemptions, \u201c[u]nder\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion for summary judgment cannot be \u2018conceded\u2019 for\n\nwant of opposition.\u201d Winston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\n\u201cThe burden is always on the movant to demonstrate why summary judgment is warranted,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[t]he nonmoving party\u2019s failure to oppose summary judgment does not shift that burden.\u201d Id.,\n\nquoting Grimes v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 83, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Therefore, the Court\n\nmust still determine whether the information marked for redaction falls properly within the FOIA\n\nexemptions claimed, even though plaintiffs do not contest the exemptions.\n\nThe Court has reviewed the agency\u2019s declaration in support of its motion, as well as the\n\nunredacted version of the thirteenth production in camera, and it concludes that all of the\n\ninformation ATF marked for redaction was properly exempt under FOIA Exemptions 3, 6, 7(C),\n\n7(D), and 7(E).\n\n3 See also Joint Status Report [Dkt. # 31] at 2 (\u201cPlaintiffs do not intend to challenge the\nFOIA redactions that could have been claimed, but were not made, on Production 13.\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Resp.\nat 1 n.1 (explaining that plaintiffs \u201cstyle[d]\u201d their opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment as a \u201cResponse\u201d rather than an \u201cOpposition\u201d because \u201cthe only disputed issue between\nthe parties is Defendant\u2019s motion for a permanent protective order . . . not summary judgment\u201d);\nPls.\u2019 Resp. to Def.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Fact [Dkt. # 33-1] at 1 (\u201cPlaintiffs generally\ndo not contest ATF\u2019s Statement of Material Facts . . . .\u201d); Pls.\u2019 Suppl.

Exemption 3\n\nExemption 3 authorizes agencies to withhold information that is \u201cspecifically exempted\n\nfrom disclosure by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). The statute must either: (1) \u201crequire[] that the\n\nmatters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,\u201d or\n\n(2) \u201cestablish[] particular criteria for withholding or refer[] to particular types of matters to be\n\nwithheld.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(A)(i)\u2013(ii). And if the statute was \u201cenacted after the date of enactment\n\nof the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\u201d it must \u201cspecifically cite[] to\u201d FOIA. Id. \u00a7 552(b)(3)(B). To\n\njustify its withholding, the agency \u201cneed only show that the statute claimed is one of exemption as\n\ncontemplated by Exemption 3 and that the withheld material falls within the statute.\u201d Larson v.\n\nDep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\nATF invoked Exemption 3 to withhold information regarding \u201cspecific firearms traces\u201d\n\nderived from ATF\u2019s Firearms Tracing System (\u201cFTS\u201d) database, most of which appears in the\n\nNICS monitoring request forms to explain \u201cwhy [ATF\u2019s] subject [was] under investigation.\u201d\n\nBarnett Decl. \u00b6 19. The agency asserts that the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552 (2011) (\u201cthe Act of 2012\u201d), bars it\n\nfrom disclosing the contents of the Firearms Tracing System. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5.\n\nCongress restricted the ATF\u2019s ability to disclose firearms tracing information in 2003,\n\nwhen it passed the Tiahrt Amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003,\n\nPub. L. No. 108-7, 117 Stat. 11 (2003). See id. \u00a7 644 (\u201cNo funds appropriated under this\n\nAct . . . shall be available to take any action based upon any provision of [FOIA] with respect to\n\nrecords collected or maintained . . . in connection with . . . the tracing of a firearm[.]\u201d); Barnett\n\nDecl. \u00b6 18. Iterations of this restriction have appeared in most, if not all, of the consolidated\n\fappropriations acts since 2003,4 until its most recent version in the Act of 2012. The current Act\n\nrequires:\n\nThat, during the current fiscal year and in each fiscal year thereafter, no\n funds appropriated under this or any other Act may be used to disclose part\n or all of the contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by\n the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\n Explosives . . . pursuant to section 923(g) of title 18, United States Code, or\n required to be reported pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (7) of such section,\n except to: (1) a Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement agency, or a\n Federal, State, or local prosecutor; or (2) a foreign law enforcement agency\n solely in connection with or for use in a criminal investigation or\n prosecution; or (3) a Federal agency for a national security or intelligence\n purpose; . . . and no person or entity described in (1), (2) or (3) shall\n knowingly and publicly disclose such data; and all such data shall be\n immune from legal process, shall not be subject to subpoena or other\n discovery, shall be inadmissible in evidence, and shall not be used, relied\n on, or disclosed in any manner, nor shall testimony or other evidence be\n permitted based on the data, in a civil action in any State (including the\n District of Columbia) or Federal court or in an administrative proceeding\n other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n Firearms and Explosives to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of such\n title, or a review of such an action or proceeding . . . .\n\nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-55, 125 Stat.\n\n552, 609\u2013610.\n\nBased on this language, most courts in this district have held that the government may\n\nwithhold trace information from the Firearms Trace System under Exemption 3. See, e.g.,\n\nAbdeljabbar v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 74 F. Supp. 3d 158, 172\u201377\n\n4 See Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L.

Sept. 1, 2005); McRae v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 869 F. Supp. 2d 151, 163 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nAnd although one court has held that the ATF cannot rely on the Act because it does not\n\n\u201cexpressly\u201d reference FOIA, see Fowlkes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives,\n\n67 F. Supp. 3d. 290, 300\u201301 (D.D.C. 2014), the Court is persuaded by the reasoning in Abdeljabbar\n\nthat:\n\n[T]he disclosure prohibitions set forth by Congress in the 2005 and 2008\n appropriations bills are still effective prospectively and beyond those fiscal\n years as a permanent prohibition, until such time as Congress expresses the\n intent to repeal or modify them. . . . Congress\u2019s uninterrupted use of this\n language in appropriations bills after 2009 supports the conclusion that\n Congress did not intend for the judiciary to depart from this long-standing\n position.\n\n74 F. Supp. 3d at 175\u201376. For their part, plaintiffs offer no reason as to why the Court should\n\ncome to a contrary conclusion; they do not argue against the agency\u2019s application of Exemption 3\n\nat all.\n\nThe Court has observed the information at issue and confirmed that it contains the firearms\n\ntracing information that the ATF is barred from publicly releasing. Therefore, the Court finds that\n\nthe agency\u2019s invocation of Exemption 3 is proper.\n\nB. Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D)\n\nATF invoked Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D) for the bulk of the information it marked for\n\nredaction: the personal information of ATF and FBI agents, agency personnel, and the subjects,\n\nassociates, and informants involved in the agency\u2019s investigations. Barnett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201325, 27.\n\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) serve similar goals. Exemption 6 shields any \u201cpersonnel and\n\nmedical files and similar files\u201d where \u201cdisclosure . . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\finvasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). The exemption is \u201cconstrued broadly to\n\ncover essentially all information sought from Government records that \u2018appl[y] to a particular\n\nindividual,\u2019\u201d Pinson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 202 F. Supp. 3d 86, 99 (D.D.C. 2016), quoting U.S.\n\nDep\u2019t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982), including \u201cpersonal information, such\n\nas names and addresses.\u201d Prison Legal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015),\n\nquoting Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Similarly,\n\nExemption 7(C) protects from disclosure information in law enforcement records that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(c).\n\nAlthough the application of both exemptions \u201cturns on a balance of the individual\u2019s right\n\nof privacy against the basic policy of opening agency action to the light of public scrutiny,\u201d CEI\n\nWash. Bureau, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 469 F.3d 126, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2006), (citation omitted),\n\nthe D.C. Circuit has held that Exemption 7(C) \u201cestablishes a lower bar for withholding material\u201d\n\nthan Exemption 6. Am. C.L. Union v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations\n\nomitted). So \u201cwhen an agency seeks to withhold records \u2018compiled for law enforcement purposes\u2019\n\nas implicating personal privacy, only Exemption 7(C) need be considered, since \u2018all information\n\nthat would fall within the scope of Exemption 6 would also be immune from disclosure under\n\nExemption 7(C.)\u2019\u201d Battle Born Invs. Co., LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., Civ. Action No. 24-067,\n\n2024 WL 5246515, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 2024), quoting Roth v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 642 F.3d\n\n1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nATF has shown that its redactions were appropriate under Exemption 7(C). As the\n\nagency\u2019s declarant explained, ATF \u201capplied minimal redactions as necessary to prevent the\n\ndisclosure of information that might reveal the identities of third parties\u201d within the production,\n\fincluding: (1) the personally identifiable information of ATF and FBI agents, and agency staff;\n\n(2) the social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, cell phone numbers, and family\n\nrelationships of the subjects of agency investigation; and (3) the identities of cooperating sources\n\nwho provided information to the government. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 27. There is a well-recognized and\n\nsubstantial privacy interest in withholding the identities of the law enforcement officers and\n\nsupport personnel conducting investigations. See, e.g., Lesar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 636 F.2d 472,\n\n487 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The Court of Appeals has also held that Exemption 7(C) protects the privacy\n\ninterests of all persons mentioned in law enforcement records, including suspects, witnesses, and\n\ninformants, Schrecker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and that such\n\nthird-party information is \u201ccategorically exempt\u201d from disclosure in the absence of an overriding\n\npublic interest. Nation Mag., Wash. Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 894, 896 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995).\n\nFurther, the agency\u2019s claimed redactions under Exemption 7(D) were proper. Exemption\n\n7(D) protects from disclosure information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould\n\nreasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source . . . [who] furnished\n\ninformation on a confidential basis.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D). A source is \u201cconfidential\u201d within\n\nthe meaning of Exemption 7(D) if they \u201cprovided information under an express assurance of\n\nconfidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.\u201d\n\nWilliams v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 69 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Here, the agency\u2019s\n\ndeclaration explains that the sources it redacted had provided tips to the ATF \u201cregarding potential\n\nillegal acquisition of firearms . . . with the implied assurance of confidentiality.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6\n\n25. The sources \u201chave ongoing relationships with ATF\u201d and \u201cwould likely be subject to retaliation\n\ffor that cooperation,\u201d so it is reasonable to infer that they provided information to the agency with\n\nthe understanding that their identities would be kept confidential. Id.\n\nAgain, plaintiff does not contest any of ATF\u2019s arguments regarding the application of\n\nExemptions 6, 7(C), or 7(D), and the Court\u2019s review confirms the agency\u2019s assertions. Therefore,\n\nthe Court finds that ATF properly claimed these exemptions.\n\nC. Exemption 7(E)\n\nExemption 7(E) protects from disclosure law enforcement records \u201cto the extent that the\n\nproduction of such . . . information . . . would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E). Exemption 7(E) \u201csets a relatively low bar\n\nfor the agency to justify withholding.\u201d Blackwell v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 646 F.3d 37, 42\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \u201cRather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing how the law will be\n\ncircumvented,\u201d it \u201conly requires that the [agency] demonstrate logically how the release of the\n\nrequested information might create a risk of circumvention of the law.\u201d Mayer Brown LLP v.\n\nInternal Revenue Serv., 562 F.3d 1190, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\nATF\u2019s declarant stated that the information claimed under Exemption 7(E) \u201creveals\n\nspecific law enforcement procedures and techniques\u201d used to \u201cidentify certain individuals as\n\ninvestigative subjects.\u201d Barnett Decl. \u00b6 31. The information appears in the sections of the NICS\n\nforms asking for \u201cwhy\u201d the subject is under investigation and \u201chow\u201d ATF knows information\n\nabout the subject. Id. The Court agrees with ATF that disclosure of how the agency finds its\n\finvestigative subjects could logically enable individuals to \u201ccircumvent\u201d those techniques, id., so\n\nit finds that the agency\u2019s claim under Exemption 7(E) is proper.5\n\nD. Segregability\n\n\u201c[N]on-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably\n\nintertwined with exempt portions.\u201d Wilderness Soc\u2019y v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 2d 1,\n\n18 (D.D.C. 2004), quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1977). ATF\u2019s declaration explains that responsive records were reviewed \u201con a line-\n\nby-line and page-by-page basis\u201d to identify reasonably segregable information, and that all\n\n\u201cmeaningful segregable information was disclosed\u201d to plaintiffs. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 32. The Court\n\nhas also reviewed the un-redacted version of the production, and it came to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, it finds that the agency\u2019s redactions satisfy the segregability requirement.\n\nII. The Court has authority to grant ATF\u2019s requested order.\n\nWhat is left to determine is what, if anything, should happen now. Because the unredacted\n\ncopy of the thirteenth production was inadvertently produced to plaintiffs, ATF asks the Court for\n\nan order directing plaintiffs and their counsel to: (1) \u201csequester the . . . inadvertently produced\n\n5 Citing Conservation Force v. Jewell, 66 F. Supp. 3d 46, 64 (D.D.C. 2014), plaintiffs assert\nthat the ATF cannot withhold information regarding its law enforcement techniques and\nprocedures under Exemption 7(E) because those \u201ctechniques and procedures . . . are unlawful and\nunconstitutional.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 26 (emphasis in original). Indeed, plaintiffs spend a large portion\nof their brief arguing that the ATF and FBI\u2019s use of the NICS is illegal. Id. at 12\u201326. But plaintiffs\nhave not brought a suit against the agencies challenging the legality of the use of NICS; they chose\nto bring a claim under the Freedom of Information Act to enforce their request for information\nabout the ATF\u2019s use of NICS. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16\u201318. FOIA is a statute concerned with the disclosure\nof information in the government\u2019s possession.\n At any rate, Conservation Force is not on point. In that case, the agency withheld\ninformation pursuant to the attorney-client privilege under Exemption 5, and the court analyzed\nwhether the crime-fraud exception to the privilege applied. 66 F. Supp. 3d at 64; see id. (\u201cPlaintiff\nhas failed to prove that any crime or fraud was committed here, let alone that the communications\nat issue were made with an intent to further the unlawful act.\u201d). This case involves withholdings\nunder Exemption 7(E), which does not recognize an exception for crime or fraud.\n\fFOIA records and the contents of those records\u201d; and (2) \u201cnot disseminate, disclose, or use for any\n\npurpose those records or the contents of those records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14.\n\nPlaintiffs take issue with the remedy only as it pertains to \u201csmall portions of [the]\n\nunredacted information.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. They do not \u201chave any interest in\u201d and \u201cagree to\n\ndestroy\u201d such records related to personally identifying information of the ATF and FBI agents,\n\nagency staff, and the subjects, associates, and informants of ATF investigation. Id. at 23\u201324. But\n\nthey do challenge the issuance of an order limiting the use of the unredacted information \u201crelated\n\nto the FBI and ATF\u2019s warrantless NICS Monitoring Program.\u201d Id. at 6, 15; see id. at 16\u201321\n\n(arguing that the public has significant interest in learning about how the \u201cNICS Monitoring\n\nProgram\u201d violates statutory prohibits and constitutional rights).\n\nSince plaintiffs have already agreed to destroy the personal information that the agency\n\nredacted under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), the Court will order it to do so. As to the rest of the\n\ninformation marked for redaction under Exemptions 3 and 7(E), the Court finds that it has the\n\nauthority to issue an order barring that information from dissemination or use.\n\na. Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police does not bar the\n Court from granting relief.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Human Rights Defense Center v. United States Park Police\n\n(\u201cHRDC\u201d), 126 F.4th 708 (D.C. Cir. 2025), \u201csquarely rejected the notion\u201d that district courts have\n\ninherent authority to limit the use or dissemination of inadvertently disclosed FOIA material, and\n\ntherefore, the Court cannot grant ATF\u2019s relief. Pls.\u2019 Suppl. Mem. at 5; Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 3\u20137.\n\nDefendant counters that HRDC does not bar the relief sought here because: (1) it is distinguishable\n\nfrom this case; and (2) the Court can rely on its \u201cequitable power\u201d under FOIA, as opposed to its\n\n\u201cinherent authority,\u201d to enforce its judgment. Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. at 4\u20135; Def.\u2019s Opp. at 2\u20133.\n\f In HRDC, the plaintiff submitted FOIA requests to the Park Police for records of certain\n\n\u201cclaims or lawsuits brought against the agency or its employees.\u201d 126 F.4th at 714. The agency\n\nPolice released the records and \u201cwithheld the names of four police officers\u201d under Exemption 6.\n\nId. But \u201cdue to errors in its redaction process,\u201d the Park Police accidentally disclosed two names\n\nof private claimants that also should have been withheld under Exemption 6. Id. at 713\u201314. The\n\ndistrict court held that the Exemption 6 withholdings were justified as to both the officers and the\n\nprivate claimants, and it \u201cinvoked its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings . . . to issue\n\na clawback order for the erroneously produced names.\u201d Id. at 712, 714\u201315.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit reversed both rulings. First, it held that the withholding of the four\n\nofficers\u2019 names was improper because the agency failed to satisfy \u201cits burden to show that\n\ndisclosure . . . would compromise a substantial privacy interest.\u201d Id. at 715. The Court observed\n\nthat the Park Police\u2019s Vaughn index and supporting declarations were \u201cwholly conclusory,\u201d lacked\n\n\u201ceven minimal substantiation of the officers\u2019 privacy interest or the potential harm from disclosing\n\ntheir names,\u201d and \u201cmerely recite[d] the elements of the analysis for whether Exemption 6\n\napplie[d].\u201d Id. at 715\u201316.\n\nThen, without commenting on whether the inadvertently produced private citizens\u2019 names\n\nfell under Exemption 6, the Court vacated the clawback order. 126 F.4th at 719\u2013720. It took issue\n\nwith the lower court\u2019s use of its inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings as a\n\n\u201cmechanism\u201d for compelling the return of inadvertently produced information when FOIA itself\n\ndid not provide for that remedy. Id. at 717. It stated that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s invocation of an inherent\n\npower must\u201d be either: (1) \u201cdocumented by historical practice\u201d; or 2) \u201csupported by an irrefutable\n\nshowing that the exercise of an undoubted authority would otherwise be set to naught.\u201d Id. at 718,\n\nquoting Cobell v. Norton, 334 F.3d 1128, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\n\fomitted). The Park Police did not argue that clawback was a \u201cdocumented historical practice,\u201d so\n\nthe Court only analyzed whether it was \u201cnecessary to buttress the district court\u2019s undoubted\n\nauthority over FOIA litigation.\u201d Id. at 718 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Circuit found that the order was not necessary, rejecting the agency\u2019s argument that it\n\nwas proper given the lower court\u2019s ruling that the inadvertently produced names fell under\n\nExemption 6. Id. at 718\u201319. The Circuit explained that \u201cnecessary\u201d orders were \u201climited to those\n\nwhich . . . are necessary to the exercise of all others,\u201d and it then listed the \u201cpowers\u201d previously\n\n\u201crecognized as necessary,\u201d including: admitting members to the bar, disciplining bar members,\n\npunishing contempt of court, vacating judgments based on fraud on the court, and punishing bad-\n\nfaith or vexatious conduct. Id. at 718, citing Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43\u201345 (1991)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because, in the Circuit\u2019s view, the \u201cprimary function\u201d of the\n\nclawback order at issue was \u201cnot to support a core judicial authority, but to fill a perceived hole in\n\nthe FOIA statute by enabling the government to put the proverbial cat back in the bag,\u201d the Court\n\nheld that it was an improper use of inherent authority. Id. at 718\u201319.\n\nThe Court went on to note that the clawback remedy could not \u201cbe squared with the terms\u201d\n\nor \u201cstructure\u201d of FOIA, given that the statute does not explicitly enable an agency to seek an order\n\ncorrecting an inadvertent disclosure. 126 F.4th at 719. The Court opined that \u201cCongress\n\npresumably acted deliberately in omitting general clawback authority from FOIA,\u201d and that,\n\n\u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations,\n\nFOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance governmental transparency.\u201d Id.\n\nStill, the Court observed:\n\nImportantly, the information at issue here is not subject to any independent\n legal prohibition on disclosure such as applies to classified documents, and\n we express no opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n analysis.\n\fId.\n\nOne problem with applying HRDC to the facts of the instant case is that the Circuit\u2019s\n\nanalysis on whether the agency properly invoked Exemption 6 referred only to the \u201cofficer names\u201d\n\nredacted by the agency, id. at 715\u201317, not the private claimants\u2019 names that were inadvertently\n\nproduced. As to that information, the Circuit moved directly to the question of whether the lower\n\ncourt had the authority to issue the clawback order at all, without deciding whether Exemption 6\n\napplied to the names in the first place. Id. at 718\u201319. So, it is not clear whether the Court\u2019s\n\ndiscussion about the clawback order was meant to reach inadvertently disclosed information that\n\nis properly, or as in this case, concededly, exempt.\n\nFurthermore, a close reading of HRDC reveals several important distinctions between that\n\ncase and this one. First, HRDC involved a plaintiff that was disputing the agency\u2019s withholdings\n\nunder FOIA, so the Circuit did not deal with the circumstances here: plaintiffs who did not contest\n\nthe agency\u2019s FOIA withholdings at all, and who have \u201cno interest\u201d in the majority of the\n\ninformation at issue. Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 6. Given HRDC\u2019s determination that the Park Police failed to\n\nsupport its withholdings, it makes sense that clawback would not be available, whether or not it\n\nwas a proper exercise of authority, because the agency was not entitled to withhold the information\n\nin the first place. That is not the case here. As the Court has detailed, everything marked for\n\nredaction by the ATF was properly exempt, and the plaintiffs have agreed to destroy most of the\n\ninadvertently produced information.\n\nSecond, the majority of the information that plaintiffs seek to retain and to be able to\n\ndisseminate falls under Exemption 3, which authorizes ATF to withhold information that is\n\n\u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure\u201d by the Consolidated and Further Continuing\n\nAppropriations Act of 2012. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). HRDC specifically carved Exemption 3 out of\n\fits ruling, noting that the information at issue was \u201cnot subject to any independent legal prohibition\n\non disclosure\u201d and that it expressed \u201cno opinion on how any such prohibition could affect the\n\nanalysis.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719. So, by its own language, the case does not bar the Court from granting\n\nrelief as to the Exemption 3 information, and it would be consistent with FOIA and the Act of\n\n2012 to restrain plaintiffs from disseminating such material.\n\nGiven the differences between the posture of this case and what the Court addressed in\n\nHRDC, that opinion does not control the outcome here.6\n\nIII. The law supports the Court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers under FOIA to\n fashion a remedy in accordance with Exemptions 3 and 7(E).\n\nAs far as the Court is aware, no court in this district has invoked its equitable power to bar\n\na plaintiff from disseminating or using information obtained by virtue of an agency\u2019s inadvertent\n\nproduction of FOIA-exempted information. The Freedom of Information Act itself says very little\n\nabout the remedies available under the statute. Its only language regarding the court\u2019s authority is\n\nsection 552(a)(4)(B), which vests \u201cthe district court\u201d with \u201cjurisdiction to enjoin the agency from\n\n6 The Court of Appeals in HRDC opined that the district court lacked inherent authority to\nmanage the case before it because \u201c[u]nlike litigation, which is an adversarial process to determine\nthe parties\u2019 rights and obligations, FOIA is a primarily administrative regime designed to advance\ngovernmental transparency.\u201d 126 F.4th at 719 (emphasis added). In this Court\u2019s view, that\nsentence ignores the fact that in many of the FOIA cases pending in this courthouse, the plaintiff\nhad to bring a lawsuit to activate the administrative process, and that often, it takes the court\u2019s\noversight and involvement to bring it to its conclusion. Once a lawsuit has been filed, the\nrelationship between the parties is not simply governed by agency regulations; it is the district\ncourt that establishes the schedule for the review and production of records by issuing orders. That\nis litigation. And during FOIA litigation, as in other civil litigation, the court may be called upon\nto manage and resolve disputes between the parties, or to direct them to take certain action by\nissuing other orders. Indeed, the FOIA statute explicitly recognizes this fundamental distinction\nbetween FOIA compliance as an administrative matter and FOIA litigation since it provides for an\naward of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs when a plaintiff has \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d in an\naction before the Court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). For those reasons, this Court takes issue with\nthe reasoning underlying that portion of the HRDC decision. But for the purposes of its ruling\nhere, the Court is adhering to Circuit authority, and its ruling with respect to the protective order\nis not predicated on \u201cinherent authority.\u201d\n\fwithholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld\n\nfrom the complainant.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). But both the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit\n\nhave commented on the relationship between FOIA and the court\u2019s equitable powers, and the\n\nextent to which a district court can fashion equitable remedies under the statute.\n\nIn Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1 (1974), a consolidation of\n\nthree cases, the FOIA requesters were companies that had contracts with the United States that\n\nwere subject to renegotiation under the Renegotiation Act. Id. at 3. During the negotiation process,\n\nthe government took the position that the companies had \u201crealized excessive profits\u201d under their\n\ncontracts, and when it refused to provide the documents supporting that determination, each\n\ncompany sought the information through FOIA requests. Id. at 4\u20135. After the government failed\n\nto respond to the requests, the companies filed suit under FOIA to compel the release of the\n\ninformation, and to enjoin \u201cany further renegotiation proceedings\u201d until the production. Id. at 5\u20136.\n\nThe district courts enjoined the renegotiation proceedings for each company. Id. at 6\u20138.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court ultimately found \u201cit unnecessary\u201d to decide whether the\n\ndistrict court could enjoin the negotiation proceedings because the companies had failed to exhaust\n\ntheir administrative remedies under the Renegotiation Act, id. at 20, it did comment on FOIA\u2019s\n\neffect on the court\u2019s equitable power to do so. First, the Court noted FOIA\u2019s purpose of \u201copening\n\nadministrative processes to the scrutiny of the press and general public,\u201d id. at 17, and the statute\u2019s\n\nlanguage conferring \u201cjurisdiction to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin\n\nthe agency from withholding agency records . . . improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\nat 18, citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(3). It then explained that while the statute\u2019s purpose and language\n\n\u201cmight suggest\u201d that \u201ccompelled production was intended to be the exclusive enforcement\n\nmethod,\u201d there was \u201clittle to suggest\u201d that FOIA \u201climit[s] the inherent powers of an equity court.\u201d\n\fId. at 19\u201320. In particular, the Court was persuaded that enjoining the release of information was\n\nnot the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d under FOIA because of: \u201c[t]he broad language of the FOIA, with its\n\nobvious emphasis on disclosure and with its exemptions carefully delineated as exceptions\u201d; \u201cthe\n\ntruism that Congress knows how to deprive a court of broad equitable power when it chooses so\n\nto do\u201d; and \u201cthe fact that [FOIA], to a definite degree, makes the District Court the enforcement\n\narm of the statute.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit has provided further analysis on the extent and nature of the court\u2019s\n\nremedial power in FOIA cases, which it summarized and applied in Citizens for Responsibility and\n\nEthics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice (\u201cCREW\u201d), 846 F.3d 1235 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2017).\n\nIn CREW, the plaintiff sued to compel the Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d)\u2019s compliance\n\nwith FOIA\u2019s \u201creading-room\u201d provision, which \u201crequires agencies to \u2018make available for public\n\ninspection . . .\u2019 certain records, including . . . \u2018statements of policy and interpretations which have\n\nbeen adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1239, quoting\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2). The plaintiff asserted that OLC opinions were subject to the reading-room\n\nprovision, and it sought an injunction directing OLC to disclose all such documents. Id. at 1239\u2013\n\n40. But in addition to that primary form of relief, the requested injunction had four additional\n\n\u201cfeatures\u201d:\n\n(1) it would apply prospectively . . . to documents not yet created; (2) it\n would impose an affirmative obligation to disclose . . . documents\n regardless of whether someone specifically requests a given document;\n (3) it would mandate that OLC make documents available to the public, as\n opposed to just [the plaintiff]; and (4) it would require OLC to make\n available to the public an index of all such documents.\n\nId. at 1240 (emphasis in original). Concerned that FOIA did not give a district court the power\n\nto order the requested relief, the plaintiff sued under section 704 of the Administrative Procedure\n\fAct, which authorizes review of agency actions \u201cfor which there is no other adequate remedy in\n\na court.\u201d Id. at 1241, quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. But the district court dismissed the case because it\n\nfound that FOIA would provide for the plaintiff\u2019s requested remedy. Id. at 1238, 1240.\n\nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit considered whether the plaintiff could obtain the relief it was\n\nseeking under FOIA. Id. at 1241\u201342. First, it drew lessons from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in\n\nRenegotiation Board:\n\nFOIA section 552(a)(4)(B) vests courts with broad equitable authority.\n True, as the Supreme Court explained in Renegotiation Board v.\n Bannercraft Clothing Co., . . . that provision \u201cexplicitly confers jurisdiction\n to grant injunctive relief of a described type, namely, \u2018to enjoin the agency\n from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency\n records improperly withheld from the complainant.\u2019\u201d . . . But as the Court\n made clear in the same decision, Congress did not intend that language \u201cto\n limit the inherent powers of an equity court\u201d in FOIA cases. . . . \u201cOnce\n invoked, the scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers is broad, for breadth\n and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\u201d . . . This is especially so\n where, as here, \u201cfederal law is at issue and \u2018the public interest is involved,\u2019\n as a federal court\u2019s \u2018equitable powers assume an even broader and more\n flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.\u2019\u201d\n\nId. at 1241\u201342 (citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Court then explained that its own \u201ccase law reflects the wide latitude courts possess to\n\nfashion remedies under FOIA, including the power to issue prospective injunctive relief.\u201d Id. at\n\n1242. It pointed to Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), where\n\nthe Court said it was confronted with the Air Force\u2019s \u201crepeated failure to disclose documents in\n\nresponse to\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s valid FOIA requests. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242, citing Payne, 837 F.2d\n\nat 487. The Air Force eventually complied with the requests during the lawsuit, but because the\n\ngovernment exhibited a pattern of \u201crepeated delays\u201d and the plaintiff had an \u201cundeniable right\u201d to\n\nthe requested information, the Court of Appeals instructed the district court to: \u201cevaluate the\n\nlikelihood that the Air Force will return to its illicit practice of delay in the absence of an\n\finjunction\u201d and to \u201cconsider the propriety of injunctive relief\u201d to prevent future delay. Payne, 837\n\nF.2d at 488, 495.\n\nCREW then pointed to Morley v. Central Intelligence Agency, 508 F.3d 1108, 1120 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2007), as an example where it \u201crecognized courts\u2019 power to order relief beyond the simple\n\nrelease of extant records.\u201d CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. In Morley, the Court determined that the\n\nagency had failed to search for responsive material in a portion of records that were likely to be\n\nresponsive. 508 F.3d at 1119\u201320. Because FOIA has a \u201cpolicy of full agency disclosure,\u201d and a\n\nrefusal to release documents for reasons unrelated to the FOIA exemptions would constitute\n\nwithholding, the Court ordered the agency to conduct a more adequate search of its records, id.\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted), even though FOIA does not specifically provide\n\nfor that remedy.\n\nCREW cautioned, though, that \u201c[a]lthough broad, courts\u2019 remedial authority under section\n\n552(a)(4)(B) is not boundless,\u201d 846 F.3d at 1242, and it pointed to two previously recognized\n\nlimits. First, it noted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for\n\nFreedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980), that \u201cfederal courts have no authority to order the\n\nproduction\u201d of records no longer in the agency\u2019s possession. Id. at 139.\n\nThen it described the Circuit\u2019s decision in Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. United States\n\nDepartment of the Interior, 88 F.3d 1191 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In that case, the plaintiff sought an\n\norder requiring an agency to publish its regulations in the Federal Register in accordance with\n\nsection 552(a)(1) of FOIA. Id. at 1201\u201302. Although that section requires agencies to \u201cpublish . . .\n\nsubstantive rules of general applicability,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D), the Circuit looked to the\n\nremedial provision of FOIA to determine whether the relief sought was proper, and the Court found\n\nthat it could not order publication. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303. The remedial provision\n\fauthorizes courts \u201cto enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the\n\nproduction of any agency records improperly withheld from complainant.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). The Court reasoned that the language focusing on the \u201cproduction\u201d of\n\nrecords to \u201cthe complainant\u201d was aimed at \u201crelieving the injury suffered by the individual\n\ncomplainant, not by the general public,\u201d so it could not order the publication of regulations to the\n\npublic. Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202\u201303.7\n\nAfter that discussion, the Court held in CREW that the district court had authority under\n\nFOIA to grant two of the forms of relief requested by the plaintiff: a prospective injunction to\n\ndisclose OLC opinions that had not yet been created, and an affirmative duty to disclose regardless\n\nof whether the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request. CREW, 846 F.3d at 1242. But, relying on\n\nKennecott, it held that FOIA did not authorize the court to order OLC to make documents available\n\nto the public at large, as opposed to just the plaintiff. Id. at 1243.\n\nConsidering that authority, the Court finds that it falls within its equitable powers under\n\nFOIA to fashion a remedy that would bar the plaintiff from publishing inadvertently disclosed\n\ninformation that falls squarely within Exemptions 3 and 7(E). The Freedom of Information Act\n\nvests the district court with \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to settle disputes brought under the statute. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). Although section 552(a)(4)(B) states that courts can \u201cenjoin\u201d an agency from\n\nwithholding records, the Supreme Court recognized in Renegotiation Board that enjoining the\n\nagency is not the \u201cexclusive\u201d power under the statute, and that the language of that provision does\n\nnot \u201climit\u201d the Court\u2019s equitable power to grant other relief. 415 U.S. at 20. While FOIA is a\n\ndisclosure statute, Congress included nine exemptions that authorize the government to withhold\n\n7 The Court acknowledged, though, that \u201cit might seem strange for Congress to command\nagencies to \u2018currently publish\u2019 . . . documents, without in the same statute providing courts with\npower to order publication.\u201d Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1202.\n\finformation, to advance a number of important interests. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(b)(1)\u2013(9). The\n\nexemption at issue here, Exemption 3, makes it clear that FOIA disclosure cannot frustrate other\n\nstatutes that mandate against dissemination. And Exemption 7(E), which is involved to a lesser\n\nextent, gives special protection to law enforcement procedures and techniques to guard against\n\nfuture circumvention of the law. These interests, which were absent in HRDC, support the\n\ninjunction. Also, since this case involves the agency\u2019s attempt to withhold information that the\n\nstatute expressly exempts from public disclosure, it does not present the problem posed in\n\nKennecott Utah Copper Corp., where the court was being asked to take action that fell well outside\n\nthe statutory scheme.\n\nTherefore, the Court will exercise its equitable jurisdiction to enter an order barring the use\n\nof inadvertently disclosed information covered by Exemption 3 and 7(E).\n\nIV. The relief does not violate plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\nFinally, plaintiffs contend that a protective order forbidding the dissemination of the\n\ninadvertently released information constitutes \u201ca classic prior restraint\u201d in violation of the First\n\nAmendment. Pls.\u2019 Opp. to Protective Order at 19.\n\n\u201cThe term prior restraint is used to describe . . . judicial orders forbidding certain\n\ncommunications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\u201d\n\nAlexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). A \u201cclassic\u201d case of prior restraint involves a governmental actor seeking a temporary\n\nrestraining order or permanent injunction to prevent the news media from publishing specific\n\ninformation. Id. at 550; see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)\n\n(featuring the President\u2019s attempt to secure a permanent injunction preventing the publication of\n\nthe Pentagon Papers after a whistleblower covertly shared them with the news media); Near v.\n\fMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697 (1931) (featuring local government officials seeking to\n\npermanently enjoin a local newspaper\u2019s publication of periodicals critical of the government).\n\nThis case does not present an unconstitutional prior restraint. \u201cAs a general rule, citizens\n\nhave no first amendment right of access to traditionally nonpublic government information,\u201d and\n\ntherefore \u201c[a] litigant seeking release of government information under FOIA . . . relies upon a\n\nstatutory entitlement \u2013 as narrowed by statutory exceptions \u2013 and not upon his constitutional right\n\nto free expression.\u201d McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Again, plaintiffs\n\ndid not contest the ATF\u2019s claimed FOIA exemptions, and the Court has already found that the\n\ninformation was properly exempt under the statute. So, because plaintiffs do not have a right to\n\nthe material found to be exempt under Exemptions 3 and7(E) in the first place, the Court\u2019s order\n\nsequestering it is not a violation of their First Amendment rights.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court will GRANT defendant\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment [Dkt. # 32], and it will DENY AS MOOT plaintiffs\u2019 motion to lift the temporary\n\nprotective order [Dkt. # 36]. A separate order will issue.\n\nAMY BERMAN JACKSON\n United States District Judge\n\nDATE: July 23, 2025\n\n29"

Coughenour, District Judge, Presiding\n\nSubmitted June 4, 2025\n Seattle, Washington\n\nBefore: Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould, and Patrick J. Bumatay, Circuit\nJudges.\n\nOpinion by Judge Gould;\n Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge Bumatay\n\nGOULD, Circuit Judge:\n\nWashington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon (\u201cStates\u201d) and individual expectant\n\nmothers (\u201cIndividual Plaintiffs\u201d) challenge as unconstitutional Executive Order No.\n\n14160 (\u201cExecutive Order\u201d), which purports to deny citizenship to the children born\n\nin United States territory of parents temporarily or unlawfully present in the United\n\nStates. See Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, Exec. Order\n\nNo. 14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). The district court entered a universal\n\npreliminary injunction which bars implementation of the Executive Order.\n\nDefendants appeal, contending that the States lack standing to challenge the\n\nExecutive Order, that it was error to issue a preliminary injunction, and that the scope\n\n2 25-807\n\fof the injunction is overbroad.\n\nWe address whether the Executive Order is constitutional and valid. We\n\nconclude that the Executive Order is invalid because it contradicts the plain language\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s grant of citizenship to \u201call persons born in the\n\nUnited States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\n\nBecause the Individual Plaintiffs are covered by a certified class action in\n\nanother federal court, 1 we decline to exercise jurisdiction over their claims and\n\ndismiss them. But because State Plaintiffs have standing and are likely to succeed\n\nin demonstrating that the Executive Order is unconstitutional, we affirm the district\n\ncourt\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction and its determination that a universal\n\npreliminary injunction is necessary to give the States complete relief on their claims.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n A\n The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted after the Civil War, in order to reject\n\nand refute the holding of Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 403 (1857), which in\n\nsubstance held that slaves and descendants of slaves were not citizens of the United\n\nStates, and \u201cto put citizenship beyond the power of any governmental unit to\n\ndestroy.\u201d Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 263 (1967).\n \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL 1904338 (D. N.H.\nJuly 10, 2025).\n\n3 25-807\n\f When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, whether birthright citizenship\n\napplied to the children of noncitizens was still an open question. But the Supreme\n\nCourt answered that question in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649\n\n(1898). When the case was decided, Chinese nationals in the United States were not\n\npermitted to become citizens. See Chinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, \u00a7 14, 22 Stat. 58,\n\n61 (1882). Chinese laborers could not re-enter the United States if they left. See\n\nScott Act, ch. 1064, 25 Stat. 504 (1888). Chinese laborers were also required to\n\nobtain a certificate of residence, and non-laborer Chinese persons were subject to a\n\nharsh presumption that they were unlawfully present. See Geary Act, ch. 60, 27 Stat.\n\n25 (1892).\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Supreme Court considered the case of Wong Kim\n\nArk, a Chinese-American man who was denied reentry to the United States, despite\n\nbeing born in the United States. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 652\u201353. The Supreme\n\nCourt canvassed English common law, early American decisions, and citizenship\u2019s\n\nmeaning to the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s drafters and then held that the Citizenship\n\nClause stands for \u201cthe fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the dominion\n\nof the United States, notwithstanding alienage of the parents[.]\u201d Id. at 68, 692\u201393.\n\nFor that reason, although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents would have been unable to\n\nnaturalize or even return to the United States, Wong Kim Ark acquired United States\n\ncitizenship \u201cby birth within the United States.\u201d Id. at 704\u201305. Since Wong Kim Ark\n\n4 25-807\n\fwas decided in 1898, and until this challenged Executive Order, the Judiciary,\n\nCongress, and the Executive Branch have consistently and uniformly protected the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s explicit guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the\n\nimmigration status of an individual\u2019s parents.\n\nB\n On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled\n\n\u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d Exec. Order No.\n\n14,160, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (Jan. 20, 2025). Section 1 of the Executive Order states\n\nin relevant part,\n\nthe privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to\n persons born in the United States:\n (1) when that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United\n States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or\n (2) when that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States at the\n time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited\n to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program\n or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United\n States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth.\n\n90. Fed. Reg. at 8449.\n\nSection 2 states that it is the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d that no federal\n\ndepartment or agency shall issue documents recognizing such persons as United\n\nStates citizens or accept documents issued by state governments recognizing such\n\npersons as citizens if they are born 30 days from the date the Executive Order was\n\nissued. Id.\n\n5 25-807\n\f Section 3 directs the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security, and Commissioner of Social Security to \u201ctake all appropriate\n\nmeasures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments\n\nand agencies are consistent with this order\u201d and mandates that officials cannot \u201cact,\n\nor forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\u201d Id. at 8449\u201350.\n\nC\n The day after the President signed the Executive Order, the States filed a\n\ncomplaint and motion for a temporary restraining order. The district court granted\n\nthe temporary restraining order. Shortly thereafter, the Individual Plaintiffs filed a\n\nputative class action. The district court consolidated the cases, and the States and\n\nIndividual Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Each group of plaintiffs moved\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, the district court granted a preliminary injunction,\n\nenjoining Defendants from enforcing or implementing the Executive Order on a\n\nuniversal basis. The district court concluded that the States had standing and that\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 standing was undisputed. On the merits, the district court\n\nconcluded that the Executive Order likely violates both the Constitution and the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA). The district court also concluded that the\n\nStates would suffer \u201cirreparable economic harm in the absence of preliminary\n\nrelief,\u201d and that the Individual Plaintiffs faced the irreparable harm of \u201cconstitutional\n\ninfringement and the specter of deportation.\u201d Finally, the district court concluded\n\n6 25-807\n\fthat the balance of the equities and public interest strongly weighed in favor of\n\nentering a preliminary injunction, because \u201cthe rule of law is secured by a strong\n\npublic interest that the laws \u2018enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by\n\nexecutive fiat.\u2019\u201d The district court granted a universal injunction after determining\n\nthat a geographically limited injunction would be ineffective to relieve the States\u2019\n\nfinancial and administrative burdens.\n\nAfter the district court granted its injunction, other courts throughout the\n\ncountry also enjoined implementation and enforcement of the Executive Order. See\n\nDoe v. Trump, No. 25-cv-10135, 25-cv-10139, 2025 WL 485070, at *14\u201316 (D.\n\nMass. Feb. 13, 2025) (universal injunction); CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00201,\n\n2025 WL 408636, at *16\u201317 (D. Md. Feb. 2, 2025) (universal injunction); N.H.\n\nIndonesian Cmty. Support v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00038, 2025 WL 457609, at *6 (D.\n\nN.H. Feb. 11, 2025) (injunction \u201cwith respect to any individual or entity . . . within\n\nthe jurisdiction of this court\u201d). The Supreme Court accepted review on the scope of\n\nthe injunction and held that the universal scope of the injunction was impermissible\n\ninsofar as it was based on individual and associational plaintiff standing, leaving\n\nopen the question whether the universal injunction may be justified in order to give\n\ncomplete relief to the appellee States. Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U.S. ____, No.\n\n24A884, 2025 WL 1773631 (June 27, 2025). The district court of New Hampshire\n\nhas since provisionally certified a nationwide class of plaintiffs and issued a\n\n7 25-807\n\fclasswide preliminary injunction, which it stayed until July 17, 2025, pending appeal\n\nin the First Circuit. See \u201cBarbara,\u201d et al. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-244-JL-AJ, 2025 WL\n\n1904338 (D. N.H. July 10, 2025).\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n A district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction, including the injunction\u2019s\n\nscope, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1073\n\n(9th Cir. 2024). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it rests its decision \u2018on an\n\nerroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous factual findings.\u2019\u201d Am. Beverage\n\nAss\u2019n v. City & County of San Francisco, 916 F.3d 749, 754 (9th Cir. 2019) (en\n\nbanc). Legal conclusions are reviewed de novo while factual findings are reviewed\n\nfor clear error. K.W. ex rel. D.W. v. Armstrong, 789 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\nIII. STANDING\n\nBecause a \u201cquestion of appellate jurisdiction must always be resolved before\n\nthe merits of an appeal are examined or addressed,\u201d we first address the questions of\n\nstanding. In re Application for Exemption from Elec. Pub. Access Fees by Jennifer\n\nGollan & Shane Shifflett, 728 F.3d 1033, 1036 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). \u201c[S]tanding must be met by persons seeking appellate\n\nreview, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.\u201d\n\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks and\n\n8 25-807\n\fcitation omitted). \u201cAll that is needed to entertain an appeal\u201d on an issue, however,\n\n\u201cis one party with standing.\u201d Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. 647, 665 (2021).\n\nUnder Article III of the United States Constitution, a plaintiff has standing if\n\nthe plaintiff can show (1) an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is concrete and particularized and\n\nactual or imminent, not hypothetical; (2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the\n\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) that it is likely, as opposed to merely\n\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defs.\n\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992). Under this general rule, standing requires\n\na showing of injury, causation, and redressability. See id.\n\nA. STATE PLAINTIFFS\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a state has standing to bring suit where the\n\nfederal government\u2019s action directly reduces the number of individuals that a state\n\nentity serves, causing a loss of revenue that the state would have otherwise received\n\nunder an existing federal contract. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 490 (2023);\n\nsee also Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 767\u201368 (2019) (finding standing\n\nwhere the inclusion of a citizenship question was likely to lead to the undercounting\n\nof the states\u2019 populations, and that this undercounting would cause states to lose out\n\non federal funds distributed on the basis of state population); City & Cnty. of San\n\nFrancisco v. United States, 981 F.3d 742, 754 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding that states\n\nhad standing to challenge a DHS rule that would render immigrants likely to\n\n9 25-807\n\fparticipate in federal programs inadmissible and ineligible for permanent residence\n\nstatus, thereby decreasing enrollment in public benefits and federal payments to the\n\nstates).\n\nHere, the States contend that the Executive Order would cause them an\n\neconomic injury by defunding and requiring substantial changes to existing public\n\nprograms such as Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Title\n\nIV-E foster care, and Social Security Act (SSA)\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program.\n\nThe States have presented evidence that more than 1100 infants born each month in\n\nthe Plaintiff States would be subject to the Executive Order. If those infants are\n\ndenied citizenship, they will be ineligible for federally-backed state-run programs\n\nsuch as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care. States generally do not receive\n\nfederal reimbursements based on services to individuals who do not have a lawful,\n\nqualifying immigration status. The States accordingly allege that they will lose\n\nmillions of dollars of contracted reimbursements that they would otherwise receive.\n\nAlso, federal law requires the States to determine whether each resident served\n\nby federal benefits is eligible. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406. Because current State systems rely on birth\n\ncertificates, place of birth, or Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to determine\n\neligibility, the States contend that they will need to create new systems to determine\n\ncitizenship and maintain compliance with federal law. The States also contend that\n\n10 25-807\n\fthey will lose \u201cadministrative fees\u201d that they would otherwise receive under the\n\nSSA\u2019s Enumeration at Birth program. See Biden, 600 U.S. 489\u201390. State agencies\n\ntransmit birth data to the SSA to facilitate the assignment of SSNs, in exchange for\n\n$4\u20135 per SSN from the SSA. If the SSA no longer issued SSNs to children subject\n\nto the Executive Order, the States expect losses of $7,320\u2013$38,129 per year.\n\nDefendants argue these alleged losses are \u201cincidental downstream economic\n\neffects\u201d that are too indirect to confer standing. Defendants rely on United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023), wherein the Supreme Court stated in a footnote\n\nthat when a state asserts that federal law or policy has only generated indirect effects\n\non state revenues or state spending, \u201cthe State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n\nattenuated.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. Defendants also cite Washington v. FDA, 108 F.4th\n\n1163, 1175\u201376 (9th Cir. 2024), in which we held that a state did not have standing\n\nto challenge the FDA\u2019s elimination of its in-person dispensing requirement for\n\nmifepristone, because the state\u2019s claimed increase in Medicaid costs was too\n\nindirect.\n\nWe conclude that the States have shown that the loss of reimbursements,\n\nfunding, and additional expenses incurred by the development of a new system to\n\ndetermine eligibility are concrete and imminent injuries-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction. We agree with the district court\n\nthat the automatic and direct effect of denying citizenship to children affected by the\n\n11 25-807\n\fExecutive Order renders them ineligible for federal programs and for Social Security\n\nNumbers, which results in a quantifiable loss of funding to the States. Nothing about\n\nthis pecuniary injury is speculative given that it is \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d See\n\nClapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013). These losses are not an\n\n\u201cindirect\u201d effect on state spending that relies on a chain of causation with multiple\n\nlinks, or assumptions about the effects of medication, or the unpredictable actions of\n\nthird parties. Cf. Texas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3; Washington, 108 F.4th at 1175\u201376.\n\nInstead, as in Biden v. Nebraska, the direct effect of the challenged federal action is\n\nto decrease the number of people for which the state will receive federal funding and\n\n\u201cadministrative fees.\u201d 600 U.S. at 477, 489.\n\nDefendants\u2019 contentions to the contrary are not persuasive. They suggest that\n\nany economic losses would be \u201cself-inflicted,\u201d because the State need not provide\n\nsocial services to an individual who is ineligible under the federal program unless\n\nthey so choose. However, it was not a voluntary choice by the States for the federal\n\ngovernment to stop paying for these services, or to assume the costs that follow. See\n\nDep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767 (finding that losing \u201cout on federal funds that are\n\ndistributed on the basis of state population\u201d was a \u201csufficiently concrete and\n\nimminent injury to satisfy Article III\u201d). And the Supreme Court in Biden v.\n\nNebraska found that Missouri had alleged standing, even though its financial injury\n\nstemmed from its choice to service federal loans. See 600 U.S. 489\u2013490.\n\n12 25-807\n\fDefendants also claim that the Executive Order does not require any changes to State\n\nsystems and does not \u201cimpose any penalty for failing to make them.\u201d Although the\n\nExecutive Order does not on its face impose a duty on the States to change their\n\nmethods of determining federal eligibility, the States would nonetheless be required\n\nto make these changes to comply with other federal laws. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1396b(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1611(a)(c)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.406.\n\nDefendants also argue that, even assuming that the States satisfy Article III,\n\nrecognizing standing here would violate the prohibition on parens patriae standing.\n\nA \u201c[s]tate does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the\n\nFederal Government.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458\n\nU.S. 592, 61 n.16 (1982). To be sure, the Supreme Court has denied states\u2019 attempts\n\nto assert third-party standing as \u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on\n\nparens patriae standing.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 n.11 (2023)\n\n(stating that Texas claimed third-party standing \u201con behalf of non-Indian families.\u201d);\n\nsee also Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024).\n\nBut the States here are not asserting standing based on the rights of their\n\ncitizens; instead, they assert injuries to their own pocketbooks that will be caused by\n\nenforcement of the Executive Order. Unlike in Brackeen and Murthy, the asserted\n\npocketbook injuries are concrete, particularized, and traceable. Cf. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. at 295\u201396 (\u201c[T]hese alleged costs are not \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to the placement\n\n13 25-807\n\fpreferences, which \u2018operate independently\u2019 of the provisions Texas identifies.\u201d);\n\nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 75 (\u201cThe States have not identified any specific speakers or\n\ntopics that they have been unable to hear or follow.\u201d).\n\nFinally, Defendants contend that third-party standing limitations also bar\n\nstanding for State plaintiffs. Prudential limitations on federal court jurisdiction\n\ndictate that: (1) a party must assert his or her own legal rights and interests, not those\n\nof others; (2) the courts will not adjudicate \u201cgeneralized grievances\u201d (i.e. \u201cabstract\n\nquestions of wide public significance\u201d); and (3) a party\u2019s claims must fall within\n\n\u201cthe zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional\n\nguarantee in question.\u201d See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474\u201375 (1982) (citations omitted);\n\nsee also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) (a plaintiff \u201cmust assert his own\n\nlegal rights and interests\u201d); Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (noting\n\nthat a constitutional claim should be brought by the person \u201cat whom the\n\nconstitutional protection is aimed\u201d). However, \u201c[the Supreme Court] has allowed\n\nstanding to litigate the rights of third parties when enforcement of the challenged\n\nrestriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties\u2019\n\nrights.\u201d Warth, 422 U.S. at 510.\n\nWe conclude that third-party standing limitations do not bar this action. The\n\nExecutive Order operates directly as to the States by preventing the States from\n\n14 25-807\n\freceiving funding and administrative fees that they would otherwise receive. In\n\naddition, the Executive Order prohibits departments and agencies of the United\n\nStates from accepting documents issued by State governments purporting to\n\nrecognize United States citizenship for persons subject to the Executive Order. See\n\n90 Fed. Reg. 8449. As a result, if the Executive Order is upheld, States will have to\n\nmodify their methods of determining United States citizenship and eligibility for\n\nfederal programs. The enforcement of the challenged government action against the\n\nStates thus results in the violation of third parties\u2019 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at\n\n510. We conclude that the States have standing to challenge the Executive Order as\n\nviolative of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause.\n\nB. INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS\n\nWe decline to exercise our jurisdiction with respect to the Individual\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 action and dismiss their claims. At the time that this lawsuit was filed,\n\nthe Individual Plaintiffs were a group of pregnant women who are noncitizens with\n\npending applications for asylum, representing a putative class of pregnant persons\n\nand future children residing in Washington State. Defendants do not dispute their\n\nstanding. Individual Plaintiffs allege that their children would be denied citizenship\n\nas a result of the Executive Order taking effect, and that that denial of citizenship\n\nwould cause loss to them of various federal benefits. We agree with the district court\n\n15 25-807\n\fthat a denial of citizenship is a concrete and imminent injury-in-fact, traceable to the\n\nExecutive Order, and redressable by an injunction.\n\nHowever, one of the Individual Plaintiffs has since given birth while the\n\nExecutive Order is enjoined, meaning that her child is now a citizen, while the other\n\nIndividual Plaintiff was due to give birth earlier this month. Because Defendants\n\nclaim that the Executive Order does not have retroactive effect, if both Individuals\n\nhave given birth before this opinion is published, there may be a question of\n\nmootness as to the Individuals\u2019 claims. Typically, if a district court certifies a class\n\nbefore the class representative\u2019s claim becomes moot, \u201cmooting the putative class\n\nrepresentative\u2019s claim will not moot the class action.\u201d Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc.,\n\n653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011). \u201cBut where, as here, the plaintiff's claim\n\nbecomes moot before the district court certifies the class, the class action normally\n\nalso becomes moot.\u201d Slayman v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., 765 F.3d 1033, 1048\n\n(9th Cir. 2014). Because the district court below did not certify the class, there\n\nremains a question as to whether Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are moot, or whether\n\nan exception to mootness applies. We decline to address that question, because we\n\ndetermine that to the extent the Individual Plaintiffs have live claims, those claims\n\nare covered by the class action certified by the district court of New Hampshire in\n\nBarbara, and dismissal of the Individual Plaintiffs is proper on those grounds. \u201cA\n\ncourt may choose not to exercise its jurisdiction when another court having\n\n16 25-807\n\fjurisdiction over the same matter has entertained it and can achieve the same result.\u201d\n\nCrawford v. Bell, 599 F.2d 890, 893 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nThe district court of New Hampshire certified a class that includes:\n\nAll current and future persons who are born on or after February 20, 2025,\n where (1) that person's mother was unlawfully present in the United States\n and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n resident at the time of said person's birth, or (2) that person's mother's\n presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's\n father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the\n time of said person's birth.\n\nBarbara, 2025 WL 1904338, at *16. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children undoubtedly are\n\nencompassed by that class definition. Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries on\n\nappeal relate to the harm faced by their children: the prospect of removal and\n\nseparation from their families, the exclusion from legal immigration status if not\n\nremoved, the denial of lawful employment and educational opportunities, and the\n\ndeprivation of both constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, both the class\n\ncertified in Barbara and the Individual Plaintiffs here seek an injunction of the\n\nExecutive Order on the basis that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the INA.\n\nSee id. at *1. There is no reason to believe that these claims will not be \u201cfully and\n\nvigorously litigated\u201d by the Barbara class representatives. See Crawford, 599 F.2d\n\nat 893. Because Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 children can obtain relief for those injuries\n\nthrough the class certified by the District Court of New Hampshire, and because\n\nrelief in this court may conflict with or circumscribe the flexibility of relief in that\n\n17 25-807\n\fother case, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction over the Individual Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims and proceed only with the State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\nIV. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n A party is only entitled to a preliminary injunction if the party demonstrates\n\n\u201c[1] that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; [2] that [it] is likely to suffer an\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; [3] that the balance of equities\n\ntips in [its] favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter v.\n\nNRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \u201cLikelihood of success on the merits is \u2018the most\n\nimportant\u2019 factor; if a movant fails to meet this \u2018threshold inquiry,\u2019 we need not\n\nconsider the other factors.\u201d California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 575 (2018) (quoting\n\nDisney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation\n\nomitted)). We first consider whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits\n\nof their claims. Upon determining that they are likely to succeed, we then proceed\n\nto consider the remaining prongs of the Winter test.\n\nA. MERITS\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause. They also contend that the Executive Order\n\nviolates the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401. We first address whether the Executive Order\n\nviolates the Citizenship Clause.\n\n18 25-807\n\f 1. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThe text of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause explicitly reads:\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside.\u201d U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. The parties dispute the meaning of \u201csubject to the\n\njurisdiction thereof.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the phrase \u201csubject to jurisdiction thereof\u201d means\n\n\u201csubject to United States authority and laws,\u201d and exempts a small and well-defined\n\ngroup of people who are born in United States territory yet not subject to United\n\nStates authority. Because the Executive Order attempts to exempt from citizenship\n\npersons who are both born in the United States and subject to United States authority,\n\nPlaintiffs contend that it violates the Citizenship Clause.\n\nDefendants, in contending that the Executive Order is constitutional, advance\n\na novel interpretation of the phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d They first\n\ncontend that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as used in the Citizenship Clause does not refer to\n\n\u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d i.e., jurisdiction as defined by a government\u2019s authority\n\nand lawmaking power, but instead refers to \u201cpolitical jurisdiction,\u201d which they\n\ndefine as \u201ca concept rooted in allegiance and protection.\u201d By their definition, persons\n\nare only subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States if they \u201cowe primary\n\nallegiance to the United States,\u201d excluding \u201cthose persons [who] owe allegiance to\n\n19 25-807\n\fa different sovereign.\u201d They then contend that a person only owes such allegiance\n\nto the country in which the person is permanently domiciled, and the domicile of a\n\nchild follows the domicile of the parent. They assert that because individuals present\n\ntemporarily or unlawfully in the United States cannot establish permanent domicile,\n\ntheir children born on United States soil do not owe allegiance to the United States\n\nand are not subject to its political jurisdiction.\n\na. Ordinary Meaning\n\nWe conclude that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment supports the\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 interpretation. In interpreting the text of the Constitution, courts are\n\n\u201cguided by the principle that \u2018[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the\n\nvoters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished\n\nfrom technical meaning.\u2019\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 544 U.S. 570, 576 (2008)\n\n(quoting United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 731 (1931)). When the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was adopted, as it is today, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was commonly used in\n\nreference to the power of the courts, defined as \u201c[t]he legal power or authority of\n\nhearing and determining causes.\u201d Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language 732 (1865). But in reference to nations, \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was also\n\ndefined as the \u201c[p]ower of governing or legislating; the right of making or enforcing\n\nlaws; the power or right of exercising authority;\u201d and the \u201climit within which power\n\nmay be exercised,\u201d or \u201cextent of power or authority.\u201d Id; see also Benjamin\n\n20 25-807\n\fVaughan Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English\n\nJurisprudence 671 (1879) (defining jurisdiction as \u201c[t]he authority of government;\n\nthe sway of a sovereign power.\u201d). This ordinary meaning of jurisdiction is consistent\n\nwith Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d as subject to the\n\nlaws and authority of the United States.\n\nDefendants point to no contrary dictionary definitions that define jurisdiction\n\nin terms of allegiance and protection. Indeed, they make no arguments about the\n\nordinary meaning of the Citizenship Clause at all. Defendants\u2019 only argument based\n\non the text of the Citizenship Clause is that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d cannot\n\nsimply refer to \u201cregulatory jurisdiction,\u201d because that definition would render the\n\nCitizenship Clause\u2019s requirement of jurisdiction surplusage. They claim that the\n\nUnited States has \u201cexclusive and absolute\u201d regulatory jurisdiction within its\n\nterritory, so that all children born in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction.\n\nId. They further contend that that definition does not explain why certain groups,\n\nsuch as Native Americans and children of diplomats, were excluded from\n\ncitizenship.\n\nSupreme Court precedent makes clear that reading \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\n\nthereof\u201d to mean \u201csubject to United States authority and laws\u201d is not redundant. In\n\nWong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court directly addressed the meaning of the phrase\n\n\u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 169 U.S. 649. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he real\n\n21 25-807\n\fobject of\u201d the dual requirements of birth in U.S. territory and being subject to United\n\nStates jurisdiction was, \u201cto exclude, by the fewest and fittest words, (besides children\n\nof members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National\n\nGovernment, unknown to the common law), the two classes of cases, \u2013 children born\n\nof alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of\n\na foreign State, both of which . . . had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental\n\nrule of citizenship by birth within the country.\u201d Id. at 682.\n\nThe Court in Wong Kim Ark held that these \u201cclasses of cases\u201d are not fully\n\nsubject to United States authority and laws, despite Defendants\u2019 contentions to the\n\ncontrary. The Court, relying on Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in Schooner\n\nExchange, said that while \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is\n\nnecessarily exclusive and absolute,\u201d there are certain cases \u201cin which every\n\nsovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive\n\nterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 683\u2013684 (quoting Schooner Exch. v. McFaddon, 11\n\nU.S. 116, 136 (1812)). When a hostile foreign power occupies United States\n\nterritory, the Court said that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of the United States over the territory\n\n[is], of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be\n\nrightfully enforced there[.]\u201d Id. at 683 (quoting United States v. Rice, 17 U.S. 246,\n\n254 (1819)) (emphasis added). With respect to the immunity of foreign ministers\n\nfrom United States jurisdiction, \u201cthe immunity itself is granted by the governing\n\n22 25-807\n\fpower of the nation to which the minister is deputed.\u201d Id. at 685 (quoting Schooner\n\nExch., 11 U.S. at 138).\n\nThe Court contrasted these two groups with private individuals, who it stated\n\ncannot be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country that they are in, because,\n\nWhen private individuals of one nation spread themselves through another as\n business or caprice may direct . . . it would be obviously inconvenient and\n dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction, and\n the government to degradation, if such individuals or merchants did not owe\n temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of\n the country.\nId. at 685\u201386 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144) (emphasis added). The\n\nCourt\u2019s primary concern, in distinguishing private individuals from the exempted\n\ngroups, was whether they were subject to the laws and enforcement power of the\n\nUnited States. Because the Court in Wong Kim Ark reasoned that the words \u201csubject\n\nto the jurisdiction thereof\u201d must be understood \u201cin the same sense in which the like\n\nwords had been used by Chief Justice Marshall in the well known case of The\n\nExchange,\u201d the Court must have understood the phrase to refer to the United States\u2019s\n\nability to fully subject an individual to its laws. See id. at 687.\n\nThe Court in Elk v. Wilkins similarly exempted members of Indian tribes from\n\ncitizenship because they were not subject to the full regulatory authority of the\n\nUnited States.2 112 U.S. 94 (1884). While the United States could deal with the\n Congress later expanded citizenship to Native American children via statute. See\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(b) (1924).\n\n23 25-807\n\fTribes \u201ceither through treaties made by the President and Senate, or through acts of\n\nCongress in the ordinary forms of legislation,\u201d the Court in Elk recognized that,\n\n\u201c[g]eneral acts of Congress did not apply to Indians, unless so expressed as to clearly\n\nmanifest an intention to include them.\u201d Id. at 100\u201301. This statement reflects the\n\nunique position of the Tribes, which have sovereignty and are not subject to the full\n\nregulatory jurisdiction of the United States. See, e.g., Haaland v. Brackeen, 599\n\nU.S. 255, 310\u2013313 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (explaining that the Tribes have\n\ninherent sovereignty and are free from state jurisdiction and control).\n\nAccordingly, the Court in Elk said that members of Tribes were no more\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States \u201cthan the children of subjects of any\n\nforeign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born\n\nwithin the United States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign\n\nnations.\u201d 112 U.S. at 102. Regardless, the Court in Wong Kim Ark also held clearly\n\nthat \u201c[t]he decision in Elk v. Wilkins concerned only members of the Indian tribes\n\nwithin the United States, and had no tendency to deny citizenship to children born\n\nin the United States of foreign parents of Caucasian, African, or Mongolian descent,\n\nnot-in the diplomatic service of a foreign country.\u201d 169 U.S. at 682. Because the\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that children of diplomats, children of invading\n\narmies, and children of tribal members were understood not to be fully subject to\n\n24 25-807\n\fUnited States authority and laws, interpreting jurisdiction in accordance with its\n\nordinary meaning is not redundant.\n\nb. Supreme Court Precedent\n\nThe argument that Supreme Court precedent supports Defendants\u2019 reading is\n\nsimilarly unavailing. First, Defendants\u2019 claimed distinction between political\n\njurisdiction and regulatory jurisdiction is not supported by precedent. Both the\n\nSupreme Court and our Court have used \u201cpolitical jurisdiction\u201d to refer merely to\n\nthe United States\u2019 lawmaking authority. See, e.g., Smith v. Turner, 48 U.S. 283, 422\n\n(1849) (describing taxation as part of political jurisdiction); Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry.\n\nCo. v. McGlinn, 114 U.S. 542, 546 (1885) (describing political jurisdiction as\n\ninvolved in legislative power); Lake v. Ohana Mil. Cmtys., LLC, 14 F.4th 993, 1000\u2013\n\n01 (9th Cir. 2021) (equating political jurisdiction with \u201clegislative . . . jurisdiction\u201d).\n\nSecond, the Court did not hold or even hint that there was a requirement of\n\n\u201cprimary allegiance\u201d or exclusive allegiance in either Elk or Wong Kim Ark. To the\n\ncontrary, the Wong Kim Ark Court repeatedly equated allegiance merely with\n\nobedience to the laws of the sovereign, saying that \u201c[a]llegiance is nothing more than\n\nthe tie or duty of obedience of a subject to the sovereign under whose protection he\n\nis . . . .\u201d See, e.g., id. at 659\u2013661 (quoting Inglis v. Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 28 U.S.\n\n99, 155 (1830)). Under English common law, \u201c[s]uch allegiance and protection\n\nwere mutual . . . and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized\n\n25 25-807\n\fsubjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance; but were predicable of\n\naliens in amity, so long as they were within the kingdom.\u201d Id. at 655. Rather than\n\ndescribe this allegiance as primary or exclusive, the Court characterized the\n\nallegiance owed by foreign \u201cindividuals and merchants\u201d as \u201ctemporary and local\u201d\n\nwhich was necessary to avoid \u201csubjecting the laws to continual infraction.\u201d Id. at\n\n685 (quoting Schooner Exch, 11 U.S. at 144). The context of the opinion makes\n\nclear that the Court did not view allegiance as a separate and unspoken requirement\n\nof jurisdiction. Instead, it considered allegiance to be part and parcel of what\n\nDefendants now label \u201cregulatory\u201d jurisdiction.\n\nThird, the proposed requirement of \u201cpermanent domicile\u201d in order to establish\n\npolitical jurisdiction also finds no basis in the text of the Citizenship Clause or its\n\ninterpreting precedent. The Wong Kim Ark Court uses the phrase \u201cpermanent\u201d only\n\nin connection with domicile once, stating that although Wong Kim Ark\u2019s parents left\n\nthe United States in 1890, they \u201cwere at the time of his birth domiciled residents of\n\nthe United States, having previously established and still enjoying a permanent\n\ndomicil[e] and residence therein at San Francisco.\u201d Id. at 652. This statement\n\nreflects the stipulated facts of the case, and the Court did not mention \u201cpermanent\u201d\n\ndomicile in its interpretation of the Citizenship Clause. See id. at 652 (\u201cThe facts of\n\nthis case, as agreed by the parties are as follows . . . .\u201d).\n\n26 25-807\n\f In its analysis, the Court said, \u201c[e]very citizen or subject of another country,\n\nwhile domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.\u201d Id. at 693. But the Court\n\nimmediately continued:\n\nIt can hardly be denied that an alien is completely subject to the political\n jurisdiction of the country in which he resides\u2014seeing that, as said by Mr.\n Webster, when Secretary of State, in his Report to the President on Thrasher\u2019s\n Case in 1851, and since repeated by this court, \u201cindependently of a residence\n with intention to continue such residence; independently of any domiciliation;\n independently of the taking of any oath of allegiance or of renouncing any\n former allegiance, it is well known that, by the public law, an alien, or a\n stranger born, for so long a time as he continues within the dominions of a\n foreign government, owes obedience to the laws of that government, and may\n be punished for treason, or other crimes, as a native-born subject might be,\n unless his case is varied by some treaty stipulations.\u201d\n\nId. at 693\u201394 (quoting 6 Daniel Webster, The Works of Daniel Webster 526 (1851)\n\n(emphasis added)). It is clear from this quoted passage both that domicile did not\n\nplay a significant role Scientology of Cal. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, 611 F.2d 738, 750 (9th Cir. 1979).\n\nBut in rigorously applying our standing doctrine, I conclude that State\n\nPlaintiffs have no standing at this time. Absent a party with Article III standing, it\u2019s\n\npremature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the\n\ninjunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\nI.\n\nState Plaintiffs Lack Standing\n\nThe federal government asserts that the State Plaintiffs lack standing to\n\nchallenge the Executive Order. In response, State Plaintiffs claim standing to protect\n\ntheir sovereign and pecuniary interests. Neither ground establishes standing. First,\n\nState Plaintiffs haven\u2019t identified a cognizable sovereign interest, and they can\u2019t sue\n\nthe federal government on behalf of their citizens. Second, State Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted\n\fpecuniary injuries are too speculative and contingent at this stage to constitute\n\ninjuries in fact. Third, State Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged loss of federal reimbursements for\n\npublic benefits is a self-inflicted injury that doesn\u2019t confer standing. Finally, Biden\n\nv. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477 (2023), doesn\u2019t provide standing.\n\nA.\n\nNo Sovereign or Third-Party Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs first argue standing to bring this challenge based on their\n\n\u201csovereign interests\u201d or their ability to litigate constitutional claims that implicate\n\ntheir residents\u2019 individual rights.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory of standing is easy to dismiss. They assert a\n\n\u201csovereign interest\u201d in defending against regulation of \u201cstate citizenship.\u201d Even if\n\nsuch an interest exists, State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown how the Executive Order\n\nregulates state citizenship in any way. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447,\n\n482 (1923) (observing that States\u2019 \u201csovereign rights\u201d are not implicated if the federal\n\ngovernment does not \u201crequire the states to do or to yield anything\u201d). By its express\n\nterms, the Order only implicates the meaning of United States citizenship and only\n\ndirects action by federal executive agencies. And State Plaintiffs point to no\n\nlanguage in the Order that implicitly alters state citizenship. At most, they suggest\n\nthat deeming some of their residents not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United\n\nStates might confer on those residents \u201csome degree of immunity from state laws.\u201d\n\fAbsolutely nothing in the Executive Order says that, nor has any party advanced that\n\nview. So, while creative, this alleged injury is neither concrete nor imminent. This\n\ntheory easily fails.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 next theory of standing seeks to vindicate the rights of their\n\ncitizens. Altering who is a United States citizen, they assert, might affect their\n\nresidents\u2019 ability to vote in local elections, serve on juries, hold local office, and\n\nbecome police officers. They also argue that they can challenge the Order based on\n\na \u201clong history\u201d of state and local government challenges to Executive Branch action\n\nimpacting individual rights. Try as they may to disclaim it, distilled down, these\n\narguments are no more than an assertion of third-party standing on behalf of their\n\ncitizens\u2014also known as parens patriae. And it\u2019s blackletter law that \u201c[a] State does\n\nnot have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal\n\nGovernment.\u201d Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 (2023) (simplified). That\n\nmakes \u201cth[is] issue open and shut.\u201d Id.\n\nStanding doctrine \u201cstrongly disfavors so\u2011called \u2018third\u2011party standing.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliam Baude & Samuel L. Bray, Proper Parties, Proper Relief, 137 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n153, 157 (2023). Generally, a party \u201cmust assert his own legal rights and interests,\n\nand cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201d\n\nKowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) (simplified). The risks of relaxing\n\nthird-party standing are obvious: \u201cthe courts might be \u2018called upon to decide abstract\n\fquestions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions\n\nmay be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial\n\nintervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\nGiven large state populations and the broad interests they may seek to\n\nvindicate, these concerns apply with greater force when States assert third-party\n\nstanding. Just as federal courts are not \u201croving commissions assigned to pass\n\njudgment on the validity of the Nation\u2019s laws,\u201d Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas,\n\nJ., concurring) (simplified), neither are States anointed privileged litigants to\n\nchallenge disfavored federal government action. Like other parties, States must\n\nshow a cognizable harm to themselves\u2014not just their residents\u2014before invoking\n\nfederal court jurisdiction to challenge federal government policy. As the Court\n\nrecognized long ago, \u201c[w]hile the state, under some circumstances, may sue [as\n\nrepresentatives of its citizens] for the protection of its citizens . . . it is no part of its\n\nduty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal\n\ngovernment.\u201d Mellon, 262 U.S. at 485\u201386. That\u2019s because \u201cit is the United States,\n\nand not the state, which represents them as parens patriae.\u201d Id. at 486.\n\nIndeed, in our constitutional system, the People are sovereign and do not need\n\nStates to act as intermediaries. See Ann Woolhandler & Michael G. Collins, State\n\nStanding, 81 Va. L. Rev. 387, 439 (1995) (arguing that the traditional \u201cpreference\n\nfor state-versus-individual actions over government-versus-government actions\n\fenhanced the status of the individual as a rights-holder against government\u201d);\n\nKowalski, 543 U.S. at 130 (considering \u201cwhether there is a \u2018hindrance\u2019 to the\n\npossessor\u2019s ability to protect his own interests\u201d when deciding whether to allow\n\nthird-party standing). After all, the common law basis for parens patriae was the\n\nneed to protect those who could not protect themselves. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son,\n\nInc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 600 (1982) (The royal prerogative\n\nserves to protect those who \u201care legally unable, on account of mental incapacity,\n\nwhether it proceed from 1st. nonage: 2. idiocy: or 3. lunacy: to take proper care of\n\nthemselves and their property.\u201d) (quoting \ufffd J. Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown 155\n\n(1820)); 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries 47 (The King \u201cis the general guardian\n\nof all infants, idiots, and lunatics.\u201d). Because our constitutional system enables\n\nindividuals to vindicate their own rights, courts should disfavor state third-party\n\nstanding.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a long history of upholding this principle. In South\n\nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), the Court held that South Carolina\n\nlacked standing to challenge a federal statute that the State alleged violated its\n\ncitizens\u2019 due-process rights. Because the State itself had no due process rights, it\n\ncould not raise its citizens\u2019 rights \u201cagainst the Federal Government, the ultimate\n\nparens patriae of every American citizen.\u201d Id. at 324. Next, in Brackeen, 599 U.S.\n\n255, the Supreme Court held that Texas did not have standing to argue that a federal\n\fstatute violated its citizens\u2019 equal-protection rights. Again, the Court held that a\n\nState could not \u201cassert third-party standing\u201d to bring a suit when the State itself\n\n\u201cha[d] no equal protection rights of its own.\u201d Id. at 294, 295 n.11. And most\n\nrecently, in Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 76 (2024), the Court held that Missouri\n\nlacked standing to bring First Amendment claims against alleged federal government\n\ncensorship of its citizens on behalf of its citizens.\n\nSo State Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of standing to protect their residents collides with\n\nthird-party standing limitations. Though they couch it otherwise, we can\u2019t ignore\n\n\u201cthinly veiled attempt[s] to circumvent the limits on parens patriae standing.\u201d\n\nBrackeen, 599 U.S. at 295 n.11. At bottom, State Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are their\n\nresidents\u2019 rights and relationships with the federal government. But as the numerous\n\nsuits filed by individual plaintiffs nationwide against the Executive Order show,\n\nindividuals are themselves capable of remedying any alleged injury. Given this, we\n\nmust deny third-party standing for State Plaintiffs.\n\nB.\n\nPecuniary Injuries Too Speculative and Contingent\n\nState Plaintiffs next assert an array of pecuniary harms to their fiscs. First,\n\nthey claim that the Executive Order will reduce their share of federal reimbursements\n\nfrom Medicaid, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d), and Title IV-E\n\nfoster care services. Because only services provided to those with U.S. citizenship\n\for certain legal immigration statuses are eligible for reimbursement under these\n\nfederal programs, State Plaintiffs allege that they will not receive reimbursements\n\nfor services provided to children born to undocumented aliens or aliens with\n\ntemporary visas. Second, the States maintain that they will incur administrative\n\nexpenses to redesign their public assistance programs and retrain their staff to verify\n\ncitizenship under the Executive Order. If citizenship is no longer determined by\n\nbirth in the United States, State Plaintiffs surmise that they will need to design new\n\ncitizen-verification protocols, update their IT infrastructure, and instruct staff to\n\nensure compliance with federal assistance programs. Finally, the States contend that\n\nthey will lose processing fees from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) for\n\ntransmitting birth-record data on U.S. citizens. Currently, the SSA pays State\n\nPlaintiffs $4 to $5 in service fees for the data, which the agency uses to generate\n\nSocial Security numbers. State Plaintiffs fear they will stop receiving this funding\n\nbecause some children born in their States will no longer be citizens under the\n\nExecutive Order.\n\nBut all these projected injuries suffer the same fatal defect. Because they sit\n\ndownstream of the Executive Order\u2019s direct effects, they rely on speculation about\n\nhow the Order might be implemented and assumptions about how independent third\n\nparties might react to its implementation. But \u201c[a]ny prediction how the Executive\n\nBranch might eventually implement\u201d the Executive Order is \u201cno more than\n\fconjecture.\u201d Trump v. New York, 592 U.S. 125, 131 (2020) (simplified). And so this\n\ncase \u201cdoes not\u2014at this time\u2014present a dispute appropriately resolved through the\n\njudicial process.\u201d Id. (simplified).\n\n1.\n\nAs stated above, we must rigorously enforce our Article III jurisdictional rules\n\nwhen asked to interfere with the actions of the political branches. \u201cA foundational\n\nprinciple of Article III is that \u2018an actual controversy must exist not only at the time\n\nthe complaint is filed, but through all stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d Id. (simplified). So\n\nplaintiffs must satisfy \u201c[t]wo related doctrines of justiciability\u201d\u2014standing and\n\nripeness\u2014to advance an Article III case or controversy. Id.\n\nFirst, to show standing, plaintiffs must establish an injury in fact, causation,\n\nand redressability. Speculation can\u2019t be used to satisfy these requirements. The\n\ninjury in fact must be \u201cconcrete, particularized, and imminent rather than conjectural\n\nor hypothetical.\u201d Id. (simplified). Alleged injuries must be \u201cimpending\u201d with some\n\n\u201ccertain[ty];\u201d the mere \u201cpossibl[ility]\u201d of \u201cfuture injury\u201d is \u201ctoo speculative for\n\nArticle III purposes.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (simplified). And the causation\n\nrequirement \u201crules out\u201d standing based on \u201cattenuated links,\u201d such as \u201cwhere the\n\ngovernment action is so far removed from its distant (even if predictable) ripple\n\neffects that the plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing.\u201d FDA v. All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 383 (2024). So \u201cPlaintiffs cannot rely on\n\fspeculation about \u2018the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the\n\ncourts\u2019\u201d to claim standing. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5 (simplified). The bottom\n\nline\u2014any asserted injury can\u2019t be \u201ctoo speculative or too attenuated.\u201d All. for\n\nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs must show the case is \u201cripe\u201d for judicial intervention. A\n\nclaim that hinges on \u201ccontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or\n\nindeed may not occur at all\u201d is \u201cnot ripe for adjudication.\u201d Texas v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998) (simplified). When challenging federal actions, courts\n\noften defer review until a concrete controversy crystallizes. That\u2019s because\n\n\u201c[d]etermination of the scope\u201d of a federal action \u201cin advance of its immediate\n\nadverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an\n\ninquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &\n\nWarehousemen\u2019s Union, Loc. 37 v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224 (1954). This is\n\nespecially so when a case \u201crequire[s] guesswork as to how independent\n\ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 413.\n\n2.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of pecuniary injuries are \u201criddled with\n\ncontingencies and speculation.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 131. Their theory of standing\n\nrequires us to swallow two big pills\u2014(1) state standing based on speculative\n\nassumptions about the indirect, downstream costs of federal government action; and\n\f(2) state standing based on predictions about how a federal policy might be\n\nimplemented. Together, these concerns doom jurisdiction.\n\na.\n\nTo begin, the Executive Order itself doesn\u2019t directly withhold funding to the\n\nStates or require the States to expend any funds. And we should be skeptical of state\n\nchallenges to executive action premised on indirect fiscal effects. As the Court\n\nrecently told us:\n\n[I]n our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies\n frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\n And when a State asserts . . . that a federal law has produced only those\n kinds of indirect effects, the State\u2019s claim for standing can become more\n attenuated.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3.\n\nIn Texas, Texas and Louisiana advanced the same derivative-costs theory that\n\nState Plaintiffs make here. The two States challenged new Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (\u201cDHS\u201d) Guidelines prioritizing the arrest of only certain undocumented\n\naliens. See id. at 673\u201374. To establish standing, they claimed that leaving more\n\nundocumented aliens within their borders would force them to spend \u201cmore money\n\non law enforcement, incarceration, and social services.\u201d Id. at 687 (Gorsuch, J.,\n\nconcurring). Even crediting those factual assertions, the Court found the alleged\n\ninjury \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d to support state standing. See id. at 680 n.3. After all,\n\fcontingent injuries, like those based on economic harms tied to predicted population\n\nchanges, will seldom amount to a cognizable Article III injury.\n\nAs Chief Judge Sutton asked in a similar context:\n\nAre we really going to say that any federal regulation of individuals\n through a policy statement that imposes peripheral costs on a State\n creates a cognizable Article III injury for the State to vindicate in\n federal court? If so, what limits on state standing remain? Even though\n it \u201cwould make a mockery . . . of the constitutional requirement of case\n or controversy,\u201d the States\u2019 boundless theory of standing\u2014in which all\n peripheral costs imposed on States by actions of the President create a\n cognizable Article III injury\u2014would allow them to challenge a\n \u201cdisagreeable war.\u201d Alexander Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966\n Sup. Ct. Rev. 79, 89\u201390 (1966). That is a bridge much too far.\n\nArizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J.) (simplified).\n\nTo Chief Judge Sutton\u2019s concerns, I add my own. Taken to its logical\n\nendpoint, the States\u2019 theory would grant them standing to contest virtually any\n\nfederal action that might tangentially affect who lives or is born within their borders.\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to State Plaintiffs, every person who crosses their borders\n\nrepresents a monetary cost or benefit on their financial ledgers. Consider some\n\nexamples. If the President were to raise the annual refugee cap\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because the presence of more aliens might someday increase state\n\nexpenditures on schools or emergency medical care? Or if Congress were to permit\n\nnationwide over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control\u2014does a State have\n\nstanding to sue because easier access could depress future birth rates, and thereby\n\nreduce the accompanying SSA administrative fees? Indeed, why wouldn\u2019t a State\n\fhave standing to challenge the removal of a single alien from within its borders given\n\nthe individual\u2019s potential fiscal impact on the State? The Constitution\u2019s case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement does not stretch so thin.\n\nIf bare conjecture that a federal action might marginally alter a State\u2019s\n\npopulation\u2014and thereby its finances\u2014were sufficient for standing, the injury-in-\n\nfact prerequisite would mean little. States would be empowered to litigate every\n\nnational policy dispute under the guise of protecting their treasuries. Merely by\n\nhypothesizing downstream fiscal effects, States could enjoy near-automatic access\n\nto federal court while other litigants face exacting hurdles. Such asymmetry\n\nthreatens to convert States into de facto \u201cgeneral-public-interest plaintiffs,\u201d drawing\n\nArticle III courts into political contests we were never meant to referee. Ann\n\nWoolhandler & Michael G. Collins, Reining in State Standing, 94 Notre Dame L.\n\nRev. 2015, 2030 (2019). At a minimum, we should require costs to state treasuries\n\nto be \u201cdirectly traceable\u201d to the federal government action to establish standing.\n\nBiden, 600 U.S. at 490.\n\nb.\n\nBut these indirect effects aren\u2019t the end of the story. Because the Executive\n\nOrder was essentially enjoined on day one, we don\u2019t know how it will actually be\n\nimplemented. The Executive Order directs federal agencies to \u201cissue public\n\nguidance\u201d within 30 days \u201cregarding this order\u2019s implementation with respect to\n\ftheir operations and activities.\u201d But the district court immediately enjoined any\n\nfederal agency from \u201c[t]aking any further steps in reliance on the Executive Order,\u201d\n\nincluding providing any implementation guidance. Thus, nothing indicates the\n\ngovernment\u2019s plan for enforcing the Order, and any prediction as to how it will do\n\nso is merely a guess.\n\nCourts are often reluctant to recognize standing or ripeness when a\n\ngovernment action is challenged too soon to understand its consequences. See, e.g.,\n\nTrump, 592 U.S. at 132\u201334; Missouri ex rel. Koster v. Harris, 847 F.3d 646, 653 (9th\n\nCir. 2017) (concluding that \u201callegations about the potential economic effects\u201d of a\n\nlaw yet to be implemented \u201cwere necessarily speculative\u201d). Predicting how a\n\npresidential parchment setting a policy goal transforms into the mechanics of actual\n\ngovernment policy \u201cinvolves a significant degree of guesswork.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S.\n\nat 132. Given that the government will eventually need to consider \u201cboth legal and\n\npractical constraints, making any prediction about future injury just that\u2014a\n\nprediction.\u201d Id. at 133. Recognizing standing and ripeness based on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries risks premature interpretation of federal policy on a barebones\n\nrecord.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries depend on discretionary decisions that have\n\nyet to be made, and so any assessment of their claims to standing can only be made\n\nafter further development. Allowing \u201cthe Executive Branch\u2019s decisionmaking\n\fprocess [to] run its course\u201d would \u201cbring[] more manageable proportions to the\n\nscope of the parties\u2019 dispute,\u201d and supply the clarity essential to our review. Id. at\n\n134 (simplified). Rather than breeze past our constitutional limits to get to the\n\nmerits, all this uncertainty requires restraint. Simply, that the Executive Order could\n\nbe administered in a way that harms State Plaintiffs does not establish that it will be\n\nso administered. Nothing prevents the federal government from adopting measures\n\nthat would reduce or eliminate any projected costs to the States. But until those\n\ndiscretionary choices are made, State Plaintiffs\u2019 purported injuries remain \u201ctoo\n\nspeculative\u201d and \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 383. So\n\nArticle III demands we wait until the federal government provides its plans before\n\nacting. If State Plaintiffs\u2019 fears become concrete after implementation is announced,\n\nfederal courts will stand ready to fulfill their constitutional duty.\n\n* * *\n\nBased on these twin concerns\u2014speculation on indirect, downstream costs and\n\nassumptions about uncertain implementation\u2014judicial intervention at this stage is\n\npremature.\n\n3.\n\nDrilling down more closely on State Plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations confirms\n\nthat they are, at this time, too speculative and too contingent.\n\f State Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of fiscal injury begins from the premise that every child\n\ndenied citizenship under the Executive Order will likewise be categorically barred\n\nfrom Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care benefits. But the Executive Order\u2019s\n\n\u201cimpact on funding is [un]certain.\u201d Trump, 592 U.S. at 133. Each of these federal\n\nprograms extends not exclusively to U.S. citizens, but also to certain \u201cqualified\n\naliens.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641(b). The Executive Order itself is silent on what\n\nimmigration status these children would receive. If they are granted lawful\n\npermanent residence, parole, or another qualifying status, the federal benefits\u2014and\n\nthe accompanying federal reimbursements\u2014could remain available. See id. State\n\nPlaintiffs also presuppose, again without support, that the federal government will\n\nwithhold every dollar of matching funds, that no other appropriations or grants will\n\noffset the difference, and that private social-service groups will not fill any gaps in\n\ncoverage.\n\nThus, the Executive Order \u201cwill not inexorably have the direct effect on\n\ndownstream access to funds or other resources predicted by\u201d State Plaintiffs. Trump,\n\n592 U.S. at 133. How the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d),\n\nDHS, and other federal agencies will address these issues is a \u201cfundamental\n\nuncertainty impeding proper judicial consideration at this time.\u201d Id.\n\nNor do State Plaintiffs identify any evidence that federal agencies will\n\nimplement the Executive Order in the maximally punitive fashion they predict.\n\fWashington, for example, suggests without evidence that it will lose pregnancy-care\n\nreimbursements for undocumented women whose newborns will lack citizenship.\n\nThat is merely a guess.\n\nState Plaintiffs also rely on demographic assumptions to allege these\n\npecuniary harms. They assume that the population of undocumented aliens in their\n\nStates will remain constant, that families will not relocate or repatriate, and that they\n\nwill seek coverage under the specified state programs. Whether any of this occurs\n\nturns on a morass of independent variables, including interstate migration patterns,\n\neconomic cycles, immigration enforcement policies, future congressional\n\nappropriations, and the discretionary policy choices of state, local, and federal\n\ngovernments.\n\nState Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of \u201cadministrative burdens\u201d fares no better. It depends\n\non a string of unsupported predictions: that HHS, SSA, and other relevant agencies\n\nwill immediately rewrite eligibility regulations, refuse to grandfather existing\n\nprocesses, mandate immediate and costly system overhauls, and deny both\n\ntransitional funding and phased\u2011compliance periods. Yet federal agencies possess\n\nample discretion to soften any new requirements\u2014by staggering effective dates,\n\nsupplying technical assistance, or fully subsidizing implementation\u2014and the record\n\ncontains no indication that they will choose the most onerous path. In any event,\n\nbecause the Executive Order by itself doesn\u2019t direct States to alter their verification\n\fsystems, the expenses State Plaintiffs might elect to incur at this stage are \u201cat least\n\npartly within [their] own control,\u201d and are neither imminent nor unavoidable. Lujan\n\nv. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 n.2 (1992).\n\nFinally, State Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed loss of Social Security processing fees rests\n\non still another unsupported chain of speculation: that SSA will bar newborns\n\nwithout U.S. citizenship from receiving Social Security numbers, that SSA will see\n\nno value in continuing to receive the data supplied by State Plaintiffs, and that SSA\n\nwill withhold the processing fee. State Plaintiffs haven\u2019t shown that SSA will refuse\n\nto either assign Social Security numbers to non-U.S. citizens or compensate States\n\nfor transmitting birth-record data regardless of citizenship. See, e.g.,\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.104(a).\n\nAll this is too speculative and contingent to support jurisdiction over State\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim at this stage. Article III doesn\u2019t give courts license to game out\n\n\u201cwhat-ifs\u201d or to indulge worst-case scenarios. State Plaintiffs\u2019 fiscal projections rest\n\non a chain of speculative assumptions\u2014hypothesizing the most punishing\n\nimplementation to inflict maximum financial loss. In short, every fiscal injury that\n\nState Plaintiffs project depends on compounded assumptions about how multiple\n\nindependent actors\u2014federal agencies, healthcare administrators, private social\n\nservices, and even individual parents\u2014might respond to the Executive Order. The\n\nalleged harms don\u2019t flow from the Executive Order \u201cin the abstract,\u201d but rather from\n\fwhatever measures the federal agencies may eventually adopt to implement its\n\ndirective. Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009). This is\n\ninsufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\n\nRigorous enforcement of the Article III requirement is indispensable. Without\n\nit, federal courts would become a forum for any parties to air generalized grievances.\n\nEven worse, federal judges would be transformed into \u201cvirtually continuing\n\nmonitors of the wisdom and soundness\u201d of federal government action. Allen v.\n\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 760 (1984) (simplified).\n\nC.\n\nAny Lost Reimbursement Would Be Self-Inflicted\n\nIn addition to being too speculative and contingent, any loss of federal\n\nreimbursements for state assistance programs would not give rise to Article III\n\nstanding because it would be a \u201cself-inflicted injur[y]\u201d\u2014\u201cnot fairly traceable to the\n\n[federal government\u2019s] purported activities.\u201d See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 418. Even\n\nif losses in federal reimbursements were to come to fruition, they would be caused\n\nby State Plaintiffs\u2019 own voluntary choices to extend benefits to aliens ineligible to\n\nreceive federal benefits. Simply, the \u201cunilateral decision[] by a group of States\u201d to\n\nextend healthcare and other benefits to those not entitled to federal reimbursement\n\ndoes not create a basis to attack the Executive Order because any \u201cfinancial injury\u201d\n\nsuffered would be \u201cdue to their own independent\u201d decisions. FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S.\n\f289, 297 (2022). After all, State Plaintiffs \u201ccannot manufacture standing merely by\n\ninflicting harm on themselves[.]\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416.\n\nPennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660 (1976), tells federal courts to guard\n\nagainst self-inflicted injuries by States. In that case, Pennsylvania gave its residents\n\ntax credits for taxes paid to other States. In turn, New Jersey taxed income earned\n\nby Pennsylvanians in New Jersey. The result\u2014Pennsylvania lost tax revenue\n\nbecause of New Jersey\u2019s tax. Id. at 662\u201363. Pennsylvania then sued New Jersey.\n\nThe Court wasn\u2019t sympathetic to Pennsylvania. \u201c[N]othing prevent[ed]\n\nPennsylvania from withdrawing [its tax] credit for taxes [its residents] paid to\n\nNew Jersey,\u201d according to the Court. Id. at 664. Thus, the \u201cinjuries to the [State\u2019s]\n\nfisc[] were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by the[] . . . state legislature[].\u201d\n\nId. So when a State can avoid lost revenue by changing its tax laws, that State lacks\n\nstanding to recoup the funds. Although Pennsylvania was a matter of original\n\njurisdiction, the Court later made clear its principle also applies to Article III\n\nstanding. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297.\n\nState Plaintiffs complain that the Executive Order will cause them to lose\n\nfederal reimbursement for their social assistance programs. They identify several\n\nstate-funded programs\u2014such as Medicaid, CHIP, and Title IV-E foster care\u2014which\n\nthey say will be underfunded because of the Executive Order. But any unreimbursed\n\fexpenditures would be the result of the States\u2019 choices to offer services to those\n\nineligible for reimbursement\u2014not the Executive Order.\n\nTake Washington\u2019s \u201cApple Health\u201d program. Apple Health is the umbrella\n\nname for Washington\u2019s medical assistance programs, which include the state-run\n\nside of Medicaid and CHIP. Both federal programs reimburse States a certain\n\npercentage of funds used to cover qualifying healthcare expenses. Historically, the\n\nCHIP federal match has been about 65%. Under federal law, with some limited\n\nexceptions, illegal aliens and those without a qualifying immigration status are not\n\neligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or other federal benefits. So federal reimbursement is\n\ncontingent on U.S. citizenship or another qualifying immigration status, such as\n\nbeing a legal permanent resident. Despite those restrictions on federal\n\nreimbursement, Washington decided to provide healthcare coverage to income-\n\nqualified children \u201cregardless of immigration status.\u201d So while citizenship or lawful\n\nimmigration status is a prerequisite for Medicaid or CHIP reimbursement,\n\nWashington volunteers to cover all children\u2014even if they do not meet the\n\n\u201cimmigration status requirements\u201d for federal reimbursement.\n\nThis is a classic self-inflicted loss. Washington\u2019s theory of injury is that the\n\nExecutive Order will lead to more non-U.S. citizens residing in the State, that the\n\nState will need to provide healthcare benefits for those aliens, and that the federal\n\ngovernment will refuse to reimburse the State for those benefits. But the decision\n\fto provide coverage to individuals regardless of immigration status was\n\nWashington\u2019s alone. See Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 74.09.470. Indeed, just last year, in\n\n2024, Washington chose to expand its medical assistance programs to\n\nundocumented adults. See 2023\u201325 Supplemental Operating Budget, ch. 376,\n\n\u00a7 211(82)(a), 2024 Wash. Laws 1, 338\u201339. Presumably, State Plaintiffs would argue\n\nthat this brand new policy decision exacerbates their alleged injury.\n\nThough States may extend their assistance programs to anyone they like, the\n\nfederal government\u2019s refusal to reimburse them for a voluntary policy decision\n\nwould not create a cognizable injury. Put differently, had Washington not\n\nindependently chosen to cover undocumented aliens\u2019 healthcare expenses, then the\n\nExecutive Order would not impact Washington\u2019s reimbursements at all. The federal\n\ngovernment would continue to provide reimbursements for those who qualify. That\n\nthe State elects to service residents beyond those who qualify for federal\n\nreimbursement makes its alleged injury directly traceable to Washington State\u2014not\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nUltimately, \u201c[n]othing in the challenged [Executive Order] required the\n\nplaintiff States to offer [expanded healthcare benefits]; accordingly, the financial\n\ninjury those States [allege they will suffer is] due to their own independent\u201d funding\n\ndecisions\u2014not the Executive Order. See Cruz, 596 U.S. at 297 (citing\n\fPennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664). And \u201c[n]o State can be heard to complain about\n\ndamage inflicted by its own hand.\u201d Pennsylvania, 426 U.S. at 664.\n\nD.\n\nBiden v. Nebraska Doesn\u2019t Confer Standing\n\nState Plaintiffs rely chiefly on Biden v. Nebraska to conclude that their\n\nasserted pecuniary injuries support standing. They cite the case for the proposition\n\nthat when the federal government cuts the number of accounts a state entity serves\u2014\n\nand thereby decreases the federal funding or administrative fees to which the State\n\nwould otherwise be entitled under a contract or grant\u2014the federal government\n\ncauses the State to suffer a concrete and direct injury. That may be a fine abstract of\n\nBiden, but it\u2019s far afield from the derivative injuries State Plaintiffs assert here.\n\nSimply put, the alleged harms in Biden were the direct and inescapable result of\n\nfederal action and were in no way speculative or contingent.\n\nBiden arose from the federal government\u2019s attempt to forgive a wide swath of\n\nstudent loans. See Biden, 600 U.S. at 487\u201389. In August 2022, the Department of\n\nEducation announced that it was issuing \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d under the\n\nHigher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. See id. at 487. As\n\nit turned out, these \u201cwaivers and modifications\u201d amounted to a plan to forgive a\n\nmonumental sum of student debt. See id. The plan was \u201cstraightforward\u201d\u2014\n\nborrowers with incomes below $125,000 would have their loans discharged up to\n\f$10,000 per borrower. Id. at 488. Estimates projected 43 million borrowers eligible\n\nfor relief and cancellation of about $430 billion in debt principal. Id.\n\nThat impending loan cancellation set off alarm bells for Missouri. Years\n\nbefore, Missouri had created the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority\n\n(\u201cMOHELA\u201d), an instrumentality of the State, to hold and service student loans. See\n\nid. at 488\u201389, 490\u201391. MOHELA owned over $1 billion of loans. See id. at 489.\n\nFurther, it had contracted with the federal government to service nearly $150 billion\n\nof federal loans\u2014meaning that MOHELA would collect payments on those loans\n\nand provide customer service to borrowers. See id. This was good business for\n\nMOHELA, which received $88.9 million in administrative fees for the five million\n\nfederal accounts it serviced. Id. at 489\u201390. The loan-forgiveness plan would have\n\ncompletely discharged \u201croughly half of all federal borrowers\u201d\u2014meaning\n\n\u201cMOHELA could no longer service those closed accounts.\u201d Id. at 490. So if the\n\nloan-forgiveness plan took effect, MOHELA would lose \u201c$44 million a year in fees\n\nthat it otherwise would have earned under its contract with the Department of\n\nEducation.\u201d Id. That \u201cfinancial harm [was] an injury in fact directly traceable to the\n\nSecretary\u2019s plan.\u201d Id.\n\nThe alleged injuries in Biden were certain and direct, not speculative or\n\ncontingent. Because the \u201cterms of the debt cancellation plan [were]\n\nstraightforward,\u201d there was no way MOHELA could escape unscathed\u2014it was\n\fgoing to lose $44 million a year as a direct result of the plan. Id. at 488, 490. That\u2019s\n\nnot the case here. As discussed above, it\u2019s speculative what effect the Executive\n\nOrder will have on the reimbursement and administration of Medicaid, CHIP, and\n\nTitle IV-E programs. Any fiscal impact would only be derivative of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s implementation. And since the preliminary injunction went into effect\n\nbefore the government had an opportunity to sketch out the specifics of the Executive\n\nOrder\u2019s enforcement, a real possibility exists that the federal government may\n\nmitigate any downstream consequences affecting these assistance programs. The\n\nsame goes for the SSA\u2019s processing fees. Nothing stops the federal government from\n\ncontinuing to collect birth data from the States or from continuing to pay processing\n\nfees. On these contingent questions, the Executive Order is silent. So the Executive\n\nOrder by itself doesn\u2019t command that States lose future downstream payments or\n\npayouts.\n\nThus, while Biden supports the proposition that the loss of federal funding or\n\nadministrative fees can be a \u201cdirect\u201d injury for standing purposes, that principle begs\n\nthe question of whether such a loss will occur at all. The more indirect and\n\nderivative the costs, the more those injuries become speculative and contingent.\n\nPicture it this way, a scraped knee is the predictable\u2014and maybe even likely\u2014\n\nconsequence of riding a skateboard. And once a child falls from his skateboard and\n\nbloodies his knees, that child has suffered a \u201cdirect injury.\u201d But no one would say\n\fthat the child was \u201cinjured\u201d as soon as his parents gifted him the skateboard\u2014no\n\nmatter how predictable the injury may have been. Likewise, the speculative and\n\ncontingent consequences of the Executive Order on federal funding and\n\nadministrative fees is worlds apart from the \u201cstraightforward\u201d terms of the\n\ncancellation plan in Biden\u2014which clearly would have discharged \u201croughly half\u201d of\n\nthe loans MOHELA serviced. Id. at 488, 490. In short, Biden does not control this\n\ncase because that case had nothing to do with Article III\u2019s bar on speculative and\n\ncontingent injuries.\n\nII.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t have jurisdiction to review State Plaintiffs\u2019 claims at this\n\ntime, I do not address their merits or the scope of the district court\u2019s injunction.\n\nI respectfully dissent in part.\n\n30"

Prior to trial, Ortiz-Rodriguez moved to\ndismiss his indictment by collaterally attacking his 2017 deportation order\nunder 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). The district court denied his motion.\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 2 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nOn appeal, Ortiz-Rodriguez argues that he satisfied \u00a7 1326(d) because\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings involved an unknowing and\ninvoluntary waiver of judicial review and violated his due process rights by\nerroneously determining that he had committed an aggravated felony. We\ndisagree, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n I\n Ortiz-Rodriguez is not a citizen of the United States but has lived in\nthe United States for most of his life. In February 2017, Ortiz-Rodriguez\npleaded guilty in Texas state court to \u201cEvading Arrest or Detention\u201d with a\nvehicle, a third-degree felony. 1 Ortiz-Rodriguez was sentenced to two years\nof imprisonment, but before his sentence ended, DHS began expedited\nremoval proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). In October 2017, DHS\nagents served Ortiz-Rodriguez with a \u201cNotice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order\u201d (also known as a \u201cNotice of Intent\u201d or \u201cI-\n851\u201d), which informed him that he was deportable because his evading-arrest\nconviction qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\n In addition to summarizing the expedited removal procedures, 2 the\nform notified Ortiz-Rodriguez that he could be represented by counsel (at his\nown expense), explained that he had the right to file a petition for review of\nthe order in a United States Court of Appeals, and provided checkboxes\nwhere Ortiz-Rodriguez could contest his deportability or request withholding\nof removal on various grounds. The form is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix. 3\n\n_____________________\n See Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 38.04.\n See also Valdiviez-Hernandez v.

Ortiz-Rodriguez also affixed his signature and\nprinted his name within another section, beneath three checked boxes, which\nstated:\n [(1)] I Do Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding\n of Removal[,] [which was the heading of the section and was in\n bold font.]\n [(2)] I admit the allegations and charge in this Notice of Intent.\n I admit that I am deportable and acknowledge that I am not\n eligible for any form of relief from removal. I waive my right to\n rebut and contest the above charges. I do not wish to request\n withholding or deferral of removal. I wish to be removed to\n Mexico[.] [\u201cMexico\u201d was handwritten.]\n [(3)] I understand that I have the right to remain in the United\n States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for judicial review.\n I do not wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\n DHS then prepared a Final Administrative Removal Order, served\nthe order on Ortiz-Rodriguez, and removed him in January 2018. At the time,\nOrtiz-Rodriguez did not challenge or appeal the expedited removal.\n Following his removal, Ortiz-Rodriguez reentered the United States\ntwice, and he pleaded guilty both times to illegal reentry pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326. For each removal proceeding, DHS reinstated the October 2017\nremoval order and deported him. Then, in May 2023, Border Patrol agents\nfound Ortiz-Rodriguez in Texas, and Ortiz-Rodriguez \u201cfreely and readily\nadmitted\u201d that he was \u201cpresent in the United States without any\nimmigration documents allowing [him] to be in or remain in the United\nStates.\u201d A federal grand jury indicted Ortiz-Rodriguez on one count of\nviolating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), which provides that \u201cany alien who . . . has\nbeen . . . deported, . . . and thereafter . . . enters, attempts to enter, or is at\n\f Case: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 4 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nany time found in, the United States\u201d without permission \u201cshall be fined\nunder Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\u201d 4\n Ortiz-Rodriguez waived his right to a jury and agreed to a stipulated\nbench trial. Ortiz-Rodriguez also moved to dismiss the indictment under 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d), which allows for a collateral attack on the validity of a prior\ndeportation order if certain prerequisites are met. 5 Ortiz-Rodriguez attacked\nhis 2017 expedited removal proceedings, arguing that his evading-arrest\nfelony conviction should no longer qualify as an aggravated felony based on a\n2018 Supreme Court decision and subsequent Fifth Circuit decision that\nresulted in Texas\u2019s evading arrest offense no longer qualifying as a crime of\nviolence that would support removal. 6\n The district court denied Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s motion to dismiss,\nholding that Ortiz-Rodriguez \u201cfailed to show that the [2017 expedited\nremoval] procedure denied him judicial review as required by \u00a7 1326(d).\u201d\nOrtiz-Rodriguez was found guilty and sentenced to fifty-one months of\nimprisonment. Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, but the\ndistrict court granted his motion for an extension of time to file a notice of\nappeal, 7 and Ortiz-Rodriguez appealed within the extended filing window.\n This appeal is consolidated with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s appeal in case No.\n24-50224, in which Ortiz-Rodriguez appealed from the revocation of a three-\nyear term of supervised release imposed as a result of a conviction in a prior\n\u00a7 1326 prosecution.

In United States\nv. Mendoza-Lopez, 18 the Supreme Court explained that where \u201cwaivers of []\nrights to appeal were not considered or intelligent, respondents were\ndeprived of judicial review of their deportation proceeding.\u201d 19 Under our\nprecedents, Ortiz-Rodriguez has the burden of showing that his waiver was\ndeficient: \u201cWhere, as here, the government has produced a written and\nsigned stipulation to removal and waiver of rights, the burden rests with the\ndefendant to show that the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d 20\n Ortiz-Rodriguez broadly argues that his \u201cwaiver was not considered\nand intelligent\u201d because it \u201cfalsely misled\u201d him first by \u201ctelling him that his\nTexas escape conviction was categorized as an aggravated felony\u201d and\nsecond by \u201cnot tell[ing] [him] that he could challenge that determination.\u201d\n The Notice of Intent stated that Ortiz-Rodriguez was deportable\n\u201cbecause [he] ha[d] been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined\nin . . . 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(F),\u201d and the form listed his evading-arrest\nconviction as the qualifying crime.

The government provides no evidence that an\n immigration officer ever met with Valdivia-Flores to explain\n the form or the issues it raised; rather, the government merely\n relies on the sufficiency of the form\u2019s text to communicate\n Valdivia-Flores\u2019s options.\n Under these circumstances, we conclude that Valdivia-\n Flores\u2019s waiver of the right to seek judicial review was not\n considered and intelligent. 35\n But Valdivia-Flores is inconsistent with our precedents, and we\ndecline to follow it; the analysis in Valdivia-Flores is based on an evidentiary\nburden that is reversed in this circuit.

The\nfirst page of the Notice of Intent, located above the checkboxes that\npermitted Ortiz-Rodriguez to admit or contest removability, advised him that\nhe had other options and rights. The page stated he had the right to seek\ncounsel from a \u201clist of available free legal services provided to [him].\u201d It also\nstated he had the right to respond to the charges within thirteen calendar days\nand that his response could \u201crequest, for good cause, an extension of time;\nrebut the charges . . . ; request an opportunity to review the government\u2019s\nevidence; admit deportability; designate the country to which\u201d he would be\nremoved with certain reservations; \u201crequest withholding of removal\u201d under\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or deferral of removal; and request withholding or\ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The page further\nstated he could file a petition for review in a United States Court of Appeals.\n The second page of the Notice was on the back. It contained a\ncertificate of service, where Ortiz-Rodriguez signed an acknowledgment that\nhe received the Notice of Intent. Beneath that certificate of service were the\naforementioned boxes, which permitted an immigrant to check whether\nremoval was contested. Ortiz-Rodriguez was not required to check either\nbox. But he did, and he signed the additional signature line beneath those\nboxes. Just above that signature line, the Notice repeated that he had \u201cthe\nright to remain in the United States for 14 calendar days in order to apply for\njudicial review.\u201d The next two sentences in that same paragraph said, \u201cI do\nnot wish this opportunity. I waive this right.\u201d After reviewing all the\ninformation on the first page, and the information on the second page, Ortiz-\nRodriguez signed on this line.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez had other options; to name one, he could have left\nboth boxes unchecked and filed a written response within thirteen days as the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 15 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nother side of the form expressly told him was an option. The only thing Ortiz-\nRodriguez had to do when served with the Notice was to sign and\nacknowledge receipt\u2014he was not required to contest or admit removability.\n The Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in Charleswell is more helpful to the\nGovernment than to Ortiz-Rodriguez. There, Charleswell launched\ncollateral challenges to both a removal order and a reinstatement order. 45\nThe Third Circuit held that Charleswell was not deprived of an opportunity\nfor judicial review of the removal order despite a \u201csubstantive error of law\u201d\nby the immigration judge (IJ). 46 However, the Third Circuit held that\nCharleswell was \u201cdenied the opportunity of judicial review of the\nreinstatement order\u201d because \u201creasonable persons reading [Charleswell\u2019s\nreinstatement notice] would be led to believe that their only avenue for relief\nif they desire to contest the reinstatement order would be to make . . . [a]\nstatement to the immigration officer.\u201d 47 The Third Circuit cited defects in\nCharleswell\u2019s reinstatement notice that are not present in this case:\n\u201cNowhere on [Charleswell\u2019s reinstatement notice] is there a statement\nalerting the alien that he may seek judicial review, pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(5),\nin the federal courts of appeals.\u201d 48 The Third Circuit even suggested that a\n\u201csensibly easy way to cure this glaring deficiency would be to amend the\nregulations governing the reinstatement process to include, directly on the\nNotice/Intent form, some notice that an alien may seek review of the\nreinstatement determination in the appropriate court of appeals.\u201d 49 The\n _____________________\n Charleswell, 456 F.3d at 349.\n Id. at 353 & n.5 (\u201c[T]he IJ, incredibly, believed that the United States Virgin\nIslands were not a territory of the United States . . . .\u201d).\n Id. at 354-57.\n Id. at 356.\n Id. at 357.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 16 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nNotice of Intent that Ortiz-Rodriguez signed includes exactly that: a\nstatement that he has the right to \u201cfile a petition for review of this order to\nthe appropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d\n This court\u2019s recent unpublished opinion in United States v.

Douglas, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n All three judges today agree that Ismael Adan Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of fundamental unfairness under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he suffered no prejudice. This alone necessitates\naffirmance. But the majority opinion nevertheless wades into a discussion of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2) and \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process requirement. I disagree with its\nanalysis in this respect and therefore dissent in part.\n I\n As one of three statutorily imposed limitations on collateral attack of\nan underlying removal order, \u00a7 1326(d)(2) requires that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nshow that \u201cthe deportation proceedings at which the order was issued\nimproperly deprived [him] of the opportunity for judicial review.\u201d 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1326(d)(2). The \u201cproceedings\u201d at issue here amounted to an immigration\nagent serving Ortiz-Rodriguez with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final\nAdministrative Removal Order (\u201cNotice of Intent\u201d) and obtaining his\nsignature on that form, thus subjecting Ortiz-Rodriguez to expedited\nremoval. The basis for his expedited removal was a 2017 Texas conviction\nfor evading arrest or detention with a vehicle, Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7 38.04(b)(2)(A), which qualified as an aggravated felony at that time. See 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1228 (permitting expedited removal proceedings for an\nundocumented immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony).\n Although Ortiz-Rodriguez concedes that he could have sought judicial\nreview of his expedited removal, he purportedly waived his right to seek such\nreview. According to Ortiz-Rodriguez, however, such waiver was neither\nconsidered nor intelligent, thereby depriving him of a meaningful\nopportunity for judicial review. See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S.\n828, 840 (1987); see also United States v. Hernandez Velasquez, 120 F.4th\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 30 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n1294, 1297 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[T]he burden rests with the defendant to show\nthat the stipulation and waiver was invalid.\u201d).\n Relevant here, a portion of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s Notice of Intent reads:\n\nAs shown, Ortiz-Rodriguez did not check the first or second checkbox\nindicating that he wished to contest his removal. Nor did he check any of the\nthree checkboxes providing factual bases for contesting his removal: (1) that\nhe is a citizen or national of the United States; (2) that he is a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States; or (3) that he was not convicted of\nthe criminal offense described in the form (i.e., the evading-arrest\nconviction). Also left unchecked was the final box indicating whether he was\nattaching any supporting documentation.\n Ortiz-Rodriguez did, however, check a box on the form that stated: \u201cI\nDo Not Wish to Contest and/or to Request Withholding of Removal.\u201d He\nalso checked a box admitting to the allegations and charge listed in the Notice\nof Intent, admitting that he was deportable, and waiving his right to rebut and\ncontest the charges.\n True enough, it seems Ortiz-Rodriguez agreed to waive his right to\ncontest removal. Yet Ortiz-Rodriguez contends that the Notice of Intent\neffectively confined his ability to contest his removability to the three limited\ngrounds provided in the checkboxes, thereby leading him to believe he could\nnot challenge the determination that he had been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony. Those three checkboxes offer only factual grounds for contesting\nremoval, and a legal challenge to the aggravated-felony classification of his\nevading-arrest conviction plainly does not fall within any of the enumerated\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 31 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\noptions. Ortiz-Rodriguez therefore asserts that by presenting a finite set of\nselections, the Notice of Intent delusively suggested that he could only\ncontest his removability on those factual grounds.\n The majority disagrees with Ortiz-Rodriguez for two reasons. See ante\nat 10\u201311. First, the majority highlights that the Notice of Intent elsewhere\nreflected Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s right to petition to the appropriate court of\nappeals. Specifically, it points to a portion of the form informing Ortiz-\nRodriguez of his right to \u201cfile a petition for review of this order to the\nappropriate U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d That portion of the form is not\ninconsistent with Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s understanding of the checkboxes: read\ntogether, one could reasonably believe that he has a right to petition for\nreview, but only on the three factual grounds identified by the checkboxes.\nSee United States v. Cortez-Zepeda, No. 24-50418, 2025 WL 1904482, at *5\n(5th Cir. July 10, 2025) (unpublished) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (\u201cLogically,\nthe form\u2019s delineated reasons for filing an appeal should explain how a\ndefendant . . . can pursue the appeal described on the first page of the\nform.\u201d).\n Second, the majority notes that the form did not state that Ortiz-\nRodriguez could only raise factual challenges. But neither did it say that\nOrtiz-Rodriguez could raise legal challenges. And the Notice of Intent\u2019s\nsilence in this respect is hardly determinative of whether Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nwaiver was considered and intelligent. If anything, the form\u2019s lack of clarity\nlends further support to Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument.\n Although omitted from the majority opinion\u2019s reasoning, I wish to\ntouch upon one point raised by the Government during oral argument: that\nthe fourth checkbox indicating the attachment of supporting documentation\nserves as a general \u201ccatch-all\u201d option for contesting removability. Oral Arg.\n18:33\u201319:00. By the Government\u2019s telling, that checkbox offered Ortiz-\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 32 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nRodriguez an exhaustive basis upon which he could contest removal for any\nreason not expressly listed in the three preceding checkboxes, including a\nlegal challenge to the aggravated felony classification. The plain language of\nthat checkbox does not support this interpretation. Although indented in line\nwith the three other checkboxes, the fourth checkbox is substantively\ndistinct. It does not provide an additional reason for contestation; instead, it\nsimply indicates that a contesting party should mark that box in addition to\nany of the three superseding checkboxes when he wishes to attach supporting\ndocumentation.\n By way of example, a party contesting removal based on citizenship\nwould mark the box that reads, \u201cI am a citizen or national of the United\nStates,\u201d and, if they attach documentation like a birth or naturalization\ncertificate supporting that challenge, they may also mark the fourth checkbox\nto indicate as much. This comports with the italicized text preceding the four\ncheckboxes that says, \u201cAttach any supporting documentation.\u201d And\nregardless, it can hardly be said that \u201cattaching documents\u201d logically\nsuggests to a potential petitioner that he may raise a legal challenge. If\nintended to be a true \u201ccatch-all\u201d option as the Government suggests, there\nare a myriad of ways to more clearly provide for such an option (e.g., \u201cOther\u201d\nfollowed by a blank space to write in the basis for the challenge would surely\nbetter achieve this purpose).\n The majority opinion also makes much of the \u201cother options\u201d Ortiz-\nRodriguez had when presented with the Notice of Intent, including that he\ncould have left the waiver box unchecked. Ante at 14\u201315. That he did not do\nso, the majority suggests, somehow validates his waiver. In so doing, the\nmajority opinion glosses over the very core of Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s argument:\nthat the \u201cchoices\u201d the form presented were misleading and, therefore, his\ndecision to check the waiver box was neither considered nor intelligent.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 33 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nAlthough Ortiz-Rodriguez was not \u201cforced to check\u201d the waiver box, that\nalone says nothing about the validity of his waiver.\n Additionally, Ortiz-Rodriguez is not alone in claiming confusion\nstemming from the Notice of Intent\u2019s limited checkboxes. Indeed, this court\ngrappled with the identical issue in a recently decided unpublished decision.\nSee Cortez-Zepeda, 2025 WL 1904482, at *3\u20134; see also id. at *4\u20135 (Dennis,\nJ., dissenting). And as the majority here acknowledges, ante at 11\u201312, the\nNinth Circuit addressed an equally misleading Notice of Intent in United\nStates v. Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2017), overruled on other\ngrounds by Alfred v. Garland, 64 F.4th 1025, 1048 (9th Cir. 2023) (en banc).\nOne question before the Valdivia-Flores court was whether the Notice of\nIntent established that Valdivia-Flores\u2019s waiver of his right to pursue a\njudicial appeal was considered and intelligent. Id. at 1206. The Ninth Circuit\nheld that it did not and, thus, the waiver did not comport with due process.\nSee id. In reaching its conclusion, the court highlighted that the Notice of\nIntent \u201cdid not include an option to contest the classification of the\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and the only check box relevant to the\nconviction itself only allowed Valdivia-Flores to contest that he \u2018was not\nconvicted of the criminal offense described.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1206. Indeed, the Ninth\nCircuit recognized that the Notice of Intent confined Valdivia-Flores to same\nthree fact-based challenges to his removal provided in Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nNotice of Intent. Id. at 1204.\n In distinguishing Valdivia-Flores, the majority opinion places great\nweight on the differing evidentiary approaches among our circuits. Ante at\n12\u201313. But even accounting for these differences, Valdivia-Flores addresses\nthe crux of the issue presented here today: a fundamentally misleading and\ndeficient form. Moreover, Ortiz-Rodriguez, like Valdivia-Flores, was not\nrepresented by legal counsel when he read and signed the Notice of Intent.\nAnd given the expedited nature of his removal proceedings, Ortiz-Rodriguez\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 34 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u201cnever had the benefit of appearing before an immigration judge, who, [ ]\npresume[ably], would have adequately conveyed both his appeal options and\nthe finality associated with waiving appeal.\u201d Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d at\n1206 (citation modified). Thus, against this backdrop, and coupled with the\nform\u2019s misleading language, I would hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s waiver of\nthe right to seek judicial review was not considered and intelligent.\n II\n The majority opinion also concludes that Ortiz-Rodriguez fails to\ndemonstrate that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair\nunder \u00a7 1326(d)(3) because he (1) received procedural due process and\n(2) suffered no prejudice. Ante at 17\u201326. I agree with the latter\ndetermination, as Ortiz-Rodriguez cannot show that he would not have been\nsubject to deportation but for the alleged defect in his deportation\nproceedings. United States v. Benitez-Villafuerte, 186 F.3d 651, 658\u201359 (5th\nCir. 1999). But I diverge with respect to the conclusion that Ortiz-Rodriguez\nreceived procedural due process.\n As an initial matter, the majority opinion rejects Ortiz-Rodriguez\u2019s\nargument that where a prior expedited removal order was premised on a\nconviction that was later found not to be an aggravated felony, the defendant\nhas established both that his due process rights were violated and that he\nsuffered actual prejudice. Ante at 17\u201319. I agree that our court\u2019s precedent\ndictates that removal under these circumstances does not obviate a\ndefendant\u2019s need to prove actual prejudice. See United States v. Ramirez-\nCortinas, 945 F.3d 286, 291\u201393 (5th Cir. 2019). 1 However, I would find that\n\n_____________________\n According to Ortiz-Rodriguez and the majority opinion, see ante at 17\u201318, this\ncourt\u2019s precedent stands in contrast to the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit in United\nStates v. Martinez, 786 F.3d 1227, 1230 (9th Cir. 2015) (\u201cWhere a prior removal order is\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 35 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\na due process violation necessarily occurs when, as here, the defendant was\nremoved via expedited proceedings predicated upon a conviction since\nrecognized not to qualify as an aggravated felony. See United States v.\nAlvarez, 60 F.4th 554, 558 (9th Cir. 2023) (holding that a defendant \u201ccan\nshow that his due process rights were violated by defects in his deportation\nproceeding if he shows that his underlying state conviction was not, in fact,\nan aggravated felony.\u201d).\n With due respect to my colleagues, the cases cited in the majority\nopinion do not support its contrary conclusion. See ante at 18\u201319. In United\nStates v. Parrales-Guzman, 922 F.3d 706 (5th Cir. 2019), we held that\n\u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s bar on collateral attacks attached despite the defendant\u2019s\nremoval order having rested on an unconstitutionally vague statute. Id. at\n707\u201308. Ortiz-Rodriguez does not question that holding. Indeed, Ortiz-\nRodriguez does not argue that he need not satisfy \u00a7 1326(d)\u2019s requirements\ngenerally or \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirements specifically. He merely asserts that\nbecause the Department of Homeland Security classified his evading arrest\nconviction as an aggravated felony, and that conviction was later held not to\nqualify as such, he has sufficiently established both a violation of due process\nand actual prejudice, thereby satisfying \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s requirement of\nfundamental unfairness. And in Parrales-Guzman, we expressly declined to\nconsider \u00a7 1326(d)(3), holding only that the defendant\u2019s collateral attack\nfailed because he did not exhaust administrative remedies as required by\n _____________________\npremised on the commission of an aggravated felony, a defendant who shows that the crime\nof which he was previously convicted was not, in fact, an aggravated felony, has established\nboth that his due process rights were violated and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d).\nBut more recent decisions from that court seemingly align with our requirement of an\nindependent showing of actual prejudice. See, e.g., United States v. Orozco-Orozco, 94 F.4th\n1118, 1128 (9th Cir. 2024) (holding that a defendant whose removal was based on a\nconviction that did not constitute an aggravated felony had established that the order of\nremoval was defective but \u201cmust [also] show that the defect prejudiced him\u201d).\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 36 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\n\u00a7 1326(d)(1). Id. at 707\u201308, 708 n.1. So, contrary to the majority\u2019s reading\nof that case, we had no occasion to consider the \u201cidentical argument\u201d raised\nby Ortiz-Rodriguez. Ante at 18.\n Our decision in United States v. Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d 286,\nlikewise offers no insight into whether a due process violation has occurred.\nWe held in that case that a defendant whose prior removal was based on a\nconviction no longer deemed an aggravated felony must demonstrate actual\nprejudice under \u00a7 1326(d)(3). Id. at 292\u201393. In other words, \u201c[i]f despite the\nalleged errors, the proceeding could not have yielded a different result,\u201d the\ndefendant\u2019s collateral attack fails for lack of actual prejudice. Id. at 292\n(citation modified). But nothing in Ramirez-Cortinas suggests that the same\nis true for the due process requirement of \u00a7 1326(d)(3); because the\ndefendant failed to show actual prejudice, we did not reach the issue of\nwhether the defendant\u2019s due process rights had been violated.\n The majority opinion\u2019s reliance upon United States v. Palomar-\nSantiago, 593 U.S. 321, 327 (2021), is equally misplaced. There, the Court\nunanimously rejected the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit \u201cthat\ndefendants are excused from proving the first two requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)\nif they were not convicted of an offense that made them removable.\u201d Id. at\n326 (citation modified). The Court reasoned that such a rule allowing an\nundocumented immigrant to circumvent the normal review process when\nthere was a substantive error in the removal order made little sense \u201cif\nfurther administrative review, and then judicial review if necessary, could fix\nthat very error.\u201d Id. at 328. Highlighting the statute\u2019s conjunctive language,\nthe Court held that \u00a7 1326(d) makes clear that its requirements are\n\u201cmandatory,\u201d id. at 326 (quoting Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016));\nthus, the procedural requirements of administrative exhaustion and\ndeprivation of judicial review \u201care not satisfied just because a noncitizen was\nremoved for an offense that did not in fact render him removable,\u201d id. at 327.\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 37 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nThe majority opinion extends the Court\u2019s reasoning in Palomar-\nSantiago to \u00a7 1326(d)(3), noting that like \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2), the\nfundamental fairness prong presents \u201c\u2018a question of procedure,\u2019 not\nsubstance.\u201d Ante at 19 (quoting United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d 225,\n230 (5th Cir. 2002)). Perhaps even more telling is the Court\u2019s unequivocal\nstatement that \u201cdefendants must meet all three\u201d prerequisites of \u00a7 1326(d).\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 326. Again, Ortiz-Rodriguez does not dispute\nthis point. The question he presents is whether he has satisfied those\nmandatory prerequisites for collateral attack of his removal order. The\nPalomar-Santiago Court did not consider that question because \u201cthe narrow\nquestion th[e] Court granted certiorari to decide\u201d asked only whether the\ndefendant was \u201cexcused from\u201d satisfying the first two statutory\nrequirements of \u00a7 1326(d). Id. at 323, 328 n.4.\n What is evident from Palomar-Santiago is that the substantive error of\nwhich Ortiz-Rodriguez complains\u2014that his removal order was premised on\na conviction later found not to be a removable aggravated felony offense\u2014\nneither excuses nor satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d)(1) and (2). See id.\nat 327 (\u201cIndeed, the substantive validity of the removal order is quite distinct\nfrom whether the noncitizen exhausted his administrative remedies . . . or\nwas deprived of the opportunity for judicial review . . . .\u201d). The Court\u2019s\nreasoning similarly applies to the actual prejudice requirement of\n\u00a7 1326(d)(3): one who is otherwise deportable suffers no prejudice from\nremoval predicated on a conviction that no longer qualifies as an aggravated\nfelony, so that error in felony classification alone does not prove actual\nprejudice. See Ramirez-Cortinas, 945 F.3d at 239.\n The same, however, is not true of \u00a7 1326(d)(3)\u2019s due process\nrequirement. When, as here, a defendant\u2019s removal order was premised\nupon a conviction later determined not to be an aggravated felony, that error\nrenders the order defective. See Alvarez, 60 F.4th at 558. Such defects in the\n\fCase: 24-50213 Document: 82-1 Page: 38 Date Filed: 07/23/2025\n\n24-50213\n c/w No. 24-50224\n\nunderlying deportation proceeding, in turn, show that defendant\u2019s due\nprocess rights were violated. See id. (holding that due process violations\noccur from defects in underlying deportation proceedings); United States v.\nGuzman, 998 F.3d 562, 566\u201367 (4th Cir. 2021) (same); United States v.\nEstrada, 876 F.3d 885, 887 (6th Cir. 2017) (same). This is so because absent\nthat aggravated felony classification, the defendant would not have been\nsubject to expedited removal proceedings. Instead, the defendant would\nhave had the opportunity to appear before an immigration judge and proffer\ndefenses and, if unsuccessful, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nPalomar-Santiago, 593 U.S. at 324. But those processes are unavailable in\nexpedited removal proceedings. Therefore, by subjecting the defendant to\nexpedited removal based upon an error in felony classification, it cannot be\nsaid that \u201cthe administrative deportation procedures . . . afforded [the\ndefendant] the unimpeded opportunity to claim all the procedural due\nprocess to which he was constitutionally entitled.\u201d Benitez-Villafuerte, 186\nF.3d at 657. For these reasons, I would also hold that Ortiz-Rodriguez has\nshown a violation of his due process rights.\n\n38"

Ct. No. 19-CIV-\n CALIFORNIA INSURANCE 06531)\n COMPANY,\n Defendant and\n Appellant.\n\nInsurance Code section 1011 requires a superior court to\nappoint the California Insurance Commissioner (commissioner)\nas the conservator of an insurance company if the insurer,\n\u201cwithout first obtaining the consent in writing of the\ncommissioner, . . . has entered into any transaction the effect of\nwhich is to merge, consolidate, or reinsure substantially its entire\nproperty or business in or with the property or business of any\n\fother person.\u201d (Ins. Code, 1 \u00a7 1011, subd. (c) (section 1011(c)).)\nCalifornia Insurance Company (CIC or CIC I) attempted, without\nthe commissioner\u2019s consent, to merge with a newly-formed New\nMexico corporation, California Insurance Company II, Inc.\n(CIC II), to redomesticate in that state. The trial court therefore\ngranted the commissioner\u2019s application to be appointed as CIC\u2019s\nconservator. Several years later, the trial court approved and\nadopted the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan that specified the\nterms for ending the conservatorship.\n CIC now appeals, arguing the conservatorship was\nunlawfully imposed and should have been vacated. CIC also\ncontends the trial court abused its discretion in approving the\nrehabilitation plan because the plan requires CIC to settle\ncertain litigation against CIC by its policyholders. CIC further\nobjects to a provision in the plan requiring that CIC\u2019s California\npolicies be reinsured and assumed by another company, and, if\nthe reinsurer is affiliated with CIC, that the reinsurer use an\nindependent third-party administrator. We find no merit in\nCIC\u2019s arguments and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n BACKGROUND\n CIC provides worker\u2019s compensation insurance to\nbusinesses. Eighty-five percent of its business is in California.\n Most worker\u2019s compensation insurance consists of\nguaranteed cost policies, under which the policyholder pays the\nsame premium rate regardless of the amount of claims ultimately\n\n1 Undesignated statutory citations are to the Insurance\n\nCode.\n\ffiled under the policy. Another type of policy is a retrospective\nrating plan, under which the premium a policyholder owes is\nadjusted after the end of the policy period, within minimum and\nmaximum levels, based on the amount of losses during the policy\nperiod. (The Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Lara (2022)\n84 Cal.App.5th 1119, 1125.) Because the premium changes based\non the amount of losses, a retrospective rating plan returns some\nrisk to the policyholder. Only large employers can qualify for\nretrospective rating plans because smaller employers are\npresumed to be less sophisticated insurance consumers and less\nable to predict their future losses.\n Retrospective rating plans are issued through an\nendorsement to a guaranteed cost policy. (See The Travelers\nIndemnity Co. v. Lara, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.)\nCalifornia law prohibits an insurer from issuing a worker\u2019s\ncompensation policy or endorsement unless the insurer files a\ncopy of the form or endorsement with a rating organization, the\nWorkers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau, which in turn\npasses it on to the commissioner for approval. (\u00a7 11658,\nsubd. (a).)\n I. EquityComp and Ensuing Litigation\n In 2011, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, Steven\nMenzies, together with others, patented a \u201cReinsurance\nParticipation Agreement\u201d (RPA). The RPA was designed to allow\nan insurer to offer a retrospective rating policy to small and\nmedium-sized companies. The RPA would accomplish this by\nhaving an employer take out a guaranteed cost policy, then the\n\finsurer would cede some of the insured risk to a reinsurer, such\nas a captive reinsurer, together with a portion of the premium.\nThe reinsurer would then enter into a side agreement with the\npolicyholder to cede some of that risk back to the policyholder. At\nthe end of the policy period, the reinsurer would refund some of\nthe premiums to the policyholder if the losses were lower than\nexpected or charge the policyholder more if the losses were\nhigher.\n Under a program called EquityComp, CIC followed this\ntemplate and issued guaranteed cost policies that had been\nsubmitted to the rating organization for the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. CIC had its affiliate, Applied Underwriters Captive\nReinsurance Assurance Company (AUCRA), reinsure some of the\nrisk and issue the side agreements to the policyholders, which\nwere not submitted for the commissioner\u2019s approval. An actuary\nemployed by the California Department of Insurance\n(department) opined that CIC\u2019s rates on the standard form policy\nwere on the order of 33 percent higher than the industry average.\n Beginning in 2012, 68 EquityComp policyholders filed\nvarious claims or actions challenging the RPA. In a 2016 ruling\nin one of those challenges, the commissioner found that the RPA\nconstituted a misapplication of CIC\u2019s filed rates in violation of\nsection 11737. (Matter of Shasta Linen Supply, Inc., Insurance\nCommissioner (June 22, 2016) No. AHB-WCA-14-31 (Shasta\nLinen).) The commissioner\u2019s Shasta Linen decision declared that\nCIC\u2019s failure to file and secure approval of the RPA as required\nby section 11658 rendered it void as a matter of law.\n\f CIC petitioned for review of Shasta Linen in Los Angeles\nSuperior Court, and in 2017 the parties settled their dispute.\nThe parties agreed they had a good faith dispute about whether\nthe RPA was void as a matter of law and the remedy authorized\nby the Insurance Code. A recital to the agreement stated that\nthis dispute was \u201cultimately for the courts to decide.\u201d CIC and\nthe department further agreed that the Shasta Linen decision\nwas precedential in administrative proceedings before the\ndepartment, the department had approved an amended RPA with\nadditional disclosures, CIC would not change the amended RPA\nwithout submitting it to the department for review and approval,\nand CIC would dismiss its writ petition. One paragraph of the\nsettlement agreement declared that nothing in it \u201climit[ed] the\npower of the Commissioner to initiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d No employers in California bought any\nEquityComp policies containing the amended RPA after the\nsettlement.\n Litigation on the other RPA claims and actions\npolicyholders had filed against CIC continued in California\ncourts, federal courts, administrative proceedings before the\ncommissioner, and in arbitration. CIC succeeded in defeating\nclass certification motions. (E.g., National Convention Services,\nLLC v. Applied Underwriters Capital Risk Assurance Co.\n(S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2019, No. 15cv7063) 2019 WL 3409882, at *1;\n\fShasta Linen Supply, Inc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (E.D.Cal.\nApr. 17, 2019, Nos. 2:16-cv-158-WBS AC, 2:16-cv-1211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 3244487, at *2.) One federal court granted CIC and its\naffiliates summary judgment on claims that the RPA violated the\nUnfair Competition Law because it was void. (Pet Food Express,\nLtd. v. AUI (E.D.Cal. Sept. 12, 2019, No. 2:16-cv-01211 WBS AC)\n2019 WL 4318584, at *2, *4.)\n In other actions, federal district courts ruled that\npolicyholders were liable for premiums due under CIC\u2019s standard\nform guaranteed cost insurance policies even though the RPA\nwas void or regardless of whether it was void. (E.g., Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb. Aug. 2, 2018,\nNo. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4 [granting summary\njudgment on premiums due under guaranteed cost policy without\ndeciding whether RPA was void].) Ten administrative decisions\nby the commissioner likewise declared the RPA to be void and\nunlawful but affirmed the legality of CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npolicies. In California courts, this court and two other appellate\ncourts held that CIC\u2019s failure to file the RPA or related\nagreement with the commissioner rendered the arbitration\nagreement contained within the RPA or related agreement void\nas a matter of law. (Jackpot Harvesting, Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 719, 738; Luxor Cabs,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (2018)\n30 Cal.App.5th 970, 976\u2013977 (Luxor Cabs); Nielsen Contracting,\nInc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1096,\n1113\u20131114 (Nielsen Contracting).) Many trial courts before and\n\fafter these decisions likewise held that the RPA\u2019s arbitration\nprovision or the RPA in its entirety was void or invalid. Two\narbitrators found the RPA to be valid, one made no ruling on its\nlegality, one did not rule on its legality under section 11658 but\nfound it contained misrepresentations and was unconscionable,\none found the RPA should have been filed but that the\npolicyholder did not have a private right of action to enforce that\nrequirement, and seven found the RPA to be invalid in whole or\nin part. Some of those arbitrators awarded damages to the\npolicyholder. One of those seven, like the federal decisions,\nissued an award requiring the policyholder to pay premiums due\nto CIC under the guaranteed cost policy. Many cases have yet to\nbe fully resolved because of a stay in connection with the\ninitiation of the conservatorship at issue here.\n II. Menzies Acquisition and Attempted Merger\n As of January 2019, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (Berkshire\nHathaway) indirectly owned 81 percent of CIC and its affiliates.\nBerkshire Hathaway agreed that month to sell its shares to\nMenzies, CIC\u2019s president and chief operating officer, who already\nowned 11.5 percent of the company. The agreement allowed\nBerkshire Hathaway to retain a $50 million breakup fee if the\ntransaction did not close by September 30, 2019.\n As required by section 1215.2, subdivision (a), in April 2019\nMenzies submitted an application to the department for approval\nof the transaction. The application informed the commissioner of\nthe breakup fee and transaction deadline. The commissioner had\n60 days to act on the application. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d).) After the\n\fcommissioner found Menzies\u2019 first two applications insufficient\nand Menzies withdrew them, Menzies submitted a third\napplication on September 7, 2019.\n On September 13, 2019, the department sent CIC various\nfollow-up questions, including a question about CIC\u2019s total\nliability in pending litigation. CIC responded that it was\ndefending 50 cases and its total liability was $50 million. CIC at\nthe time had $1.1 billion in assets, $615 million in capital and\nsurplus, and $240 million on deposit with the department. On\nSeptember 19 and 24, 2019, the department asked follow-up\nquestions on other matters, to which CIC promptly responded.\nOn September 27, 2019, the department informed CIC that it\ncould neither approve nor disapprove CIC\u2019s application by\nSeptember 30 because it had numerous remaining questions\nabout the pending litigation\u2019s financial impact on CIC.\n Berkshire Hathaway required CIC to pay $10 million for an\nextension of the transaction deadline until October 10, 2019.\nMenzies then proposed and the New Mexico Office of the\nSuperintendent of Insurance agreed to hold an expedited\napproval process to re-domesticate CIC in New Mexico by\nmerging CIC into a newly formed New Mexico corporation, CIC\nII. On October 9, 2019, a department attorney participated in a\nconfidential meeting of New Mexico, Texas, and California\ninsurance regulators. Later the same day, the New Mexico\nsuperintendent of insurance held a hearing on CIC\u2019s merger\napplication. Department representatives monitored the hearing\nby phone. A New Mexico official testified that after the meeting\n\fearlier that day, she was aware of objections from other\nregulators. The New Mexico superintendent approved the\nmerger, conditioned on the stock transactions between Menzies\nand Berkshire Hathaway closing by October 10, 2019, and CIC II\nimmediately afterwards filing articles of merger with the New\nMexico Secretary of State. The New Mexico order required CIC\nII to assume liability for all of CIC\u2019s issued policies and maintain\nits $240 million deposit with the department.\n In a press release after the hearing, the New Mexico Office\nof the Superintendent of Insurance announced that during the\npre-meeting call the department had failed to articulate any basis\nfor denying the proposed merger under New Mexico law and had\nsaid that the proposed merger presented no risks to California\npolicyholders. However, the department representatives said\nafterwards that they had never made the latter statement. The\npress release also said that no one in attendance at the hearing\noffered any objection to the merger. The department\nrepresentatives later said they did not register an objection\nduring the hearing because the issue in the hearing was whether\nto approve a transaction under New Mexico law, which was an\nissue for the New Mexico regulator.\n Later on the day of the hearing, Berkshire Hathaway\nnotified the department that, based on the lack of objections at\nthe hearing, it intended to close the sale to Menzies on October\n10, 2019. On the same day, the department notified CIC that if\nthe merger was completed without the commissioner\u2019s approval,\nCIC would be in violation of California law. Post-merger, CIC\n\fwould cease to exist, and CIC II, as an unlicensed insurer, would\nbe precluded from transacting the business of insurance in\nCalifornia until it became admitted. 2 The department did not\nrespond to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s letter, and its transaction with\nMenzies closed.\n CIC II satisfied the New Mexico superintendent\u2019s\nconditions for approval, so the merger of CIC with CIC II would\nbe completed by filing a certificate of merger with the California\nSecretary of State. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) On October\n22, 2019, the department asked CIC by telephone not to file the\ncertificate of merger with the California Secretary of State so\nthat the parties could meet and resolve their issues. CIC agreed,\nbut the parties never met.\n III. Conservatorship\n On November 4, 2019, without notice to CIC, the\ncommissioner filed an ex parte application to be appointed\nconservator of CIC. The application relied on section 1011(c),\nwhich requires a court to appoint the commissioner as\nconservator of an insurance company if the commissioner shows\nthe company has, without the commissioner\u2019s consent,\ntransferred or attempted to transfer substantially its entire\n\n2 A company is \u201cadmitted\u201d to transact a class of insurance\n\nby obtaining a certificate of authority from the commissioner.\n(\u00a7 700, subd. (a).) Before issuing a certificate of authority, the\ncommissioner must consider the applicant\u2019s qualifications with\nrespect to, among other things, capital and surplus, financial\nstability, and reinsurance, as well as the \u201ccompetency, character,\nand integrity of management\u201d and the \u201cfairness and honesty of\nmethods of doing business.\u201d (\u00a7 717.)\n\fbusiness or entered into a transaction to merge. The\ncommissioner alleged CIC violated this provision by attempting\nto merge with CIC II without the commissioner\u2019s approval under\nsection 1215.2, subdivision (a). The commissioner further alleged\nthat providing notice of the application to CIC would have been\nprejudicial because CIC could have completed the merger by\nfiling the certificate of merger. The trial court issued the\nrequested order the same day.\n In January 2020, CIC moved to vacate the conservatorship\norder, arguing, among other things, that the conservatorship was\nunnecessary because CIC consented to an injunction against the\nmerger pending the commissioner\u2019s approval. In August 2020,\nthe trial court denied CIC\u2019s motion. CIC challenged the order by\nfiling a petition for writ of mandate in this court in October 2020,\nbut this court summarily denied CIC\u2019s petition. (Cal. Ins. Co. v.\nSuperior Court (Nov. 25, 2020, A161049).) CIC II and an affiliate\nof CIC filed federal actions seeking to vacate the conservatorship\nand enjoin it. (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n530 F.Supp.3d 914; California Ins. Co. v. Lara (E.D.Cal. 2021)\n547 F.Supp.3d 908.) The district courts dismissed both suits, and\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara (9th Cir. 2022) 37 F.4th 579, 600.)\n IV. Rehabilitation Plan\n In October 2020, the commissioner filed an application for\napproval of a rehabilitation plan, which would end the\nconservatorship. Two aspects of the plan are relevant here.\n\f Section 2.2 of the plan would require CIC and AUCRA to\nenter into an \u201cAssumption Reinsurance and Administration\nAgreement\u201d to allow an insurer admitted in California to reinsure\nand assume all of CIC\u2019s California policies and liabilities to\npolicyholders. Under this provision of the plan, the commissioner\nwould solicit bids and select the reinsurer. If the commissioner\nwere to select an affiliate of CIC as the reinsurer, that reinsurer\nwould have to hire an independent third-party administrator for\nclaims administration. Upon the effective date of the assumption\nand reinsurance agreement, the commissioner as CIC\u2019s\nconservator would effectuate the merger of CIC into CIC II,\nthereby redomesticating CIC in New Mexico, and cancel CIC\u2019s\ncertificate of authority to transact business in California.\n Section 2.6 concerns the pending litigation against CIC.\nSection 2.6 incorporated by reference schedule 2.6, which sets out\nthree options under which CIC and AUCRA would offer to settle\nthe litigation against them. Option 1 would allow policyholders\nto renounce the RPA and obtain restitution of any amounts they\npaid CIC over the cost of the guaranteed cost policy premiums.\nOption 2 would allow policyholders to renounce the RPA and\nobtain restitution of any amounts they paid over the cost of a\nstandard, approved retrospective rating plan at the time of the\npolicy\u2019s inception. And option 3 would allow policyholders to\nratify the RPA and accept liability under it. CIC\u2019s liability to any\nclaimant who did not accept one of the settlement options would\npass to the reinsurer under the reinsurance and assumption\n\fagreement, and the conservator would set aside a reserve amount\nto cover those claims.\n CIC opposed the settlement provision in section 2.6 of the\nplan. It did not object to the reinsurance and assumption\nprovision in section 2.2, so long as its affiliate Continental\nIndemnity Company (Continental) had the right to match any\nother company\u2019s offer for CIC\u2019s California policies and the\ncommissioner dropped the requirement that an affiliate reinsurer\nuse an independent third-party administrator for claims\nhandling.\n The trial court approved the plan in April 2024. CIC\nappealed and also filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging\nthe approval of the plan. This court summarily denied the\npetition in a one-paragraph order, noting that CIC had failed to\ndemonstrate that its remedy on appeal was inadequate. (Cal.\nIns. Co. v. Superior Court (June 20, 2024, A170573).)\n DISCUSSION\n I. Appealability\n An order approving a rehabilitation plan for an insurer\nunder a conservatorship is appealable under section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Quackenbush\nv. Mission Ins. Co. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 458, 461, fn. 1, citing\nCode Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(1) & Carpenter v. Pacific Mut.\nLife Ins. Co. (1937) 10 Cal.2d 307, 322\u2013323 (Carpenter).)\n The commissioner disputes this and urges us to treat the\nappeal as a writ proceeding. He asserts that a conservatorship\nproceeding under Insurance Code section 1011 is a special\n\fproceeding to which section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure\ndoes not apply. He points out that section 904.1,\nsubdivision (a)(1) is contained in Part 2 of that code and that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court \u201clong ago held that Part 2 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure extends generally only to civil \u2018actions,\u2019 and not\nto \u2018special proceedings.\u2019 \u201d (Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.\nTex-Cal Land Management, Inc. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 696, 707.) That\nremark, however, concerned the applicability of the appellate\nstay provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 916 et seq. (Tex-\nCal, at pp. 706\u2013707.) In the same case, the California Supreme\nCourt also observed that \u201c[i]t has long been established that the\nstatutory right of appeal of final judgments and orders extends\neven to \u2018special proceedings [including] those intended to be\nsummary in nature\u2019 unless the Legislature has expressly\nprohibited an appeal in the particular case.\u201d (Id. at p. 705.)\nConsistent with this statement is Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at\npages 322\u2013323, which entertained an appeal from an order\napproving a rehabilitation plan and held that the appeal\nencompassed all preliminary orders that preceded it.\n The commissioner fears that aggrieved parties in\nconservation proceedings will assert a right to immediate appeal\nfrom different types of rulings, including procedural orders and\nevidentiary findings, which will create confusion and delay. We\ndo not hold that any conservation-related order is appealable,\nmerely that the rehabilitation plan order that will resolve the\n\fconservation is appealable. 3 The commissioner also suggests that\nthe approval of the rehabilitation plan does not determine all of\nCIC\u2019s rights, since the commissioner will still periodically require\njudicial orders relating to implementation of the plan. But\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 323, noted that a proceeding\nfor a conservatorship of an insurer lasts \u201cuntil the proposed plan\nis ultimately passed upon.\u201d In addition, a final judgment is a\ndetermination that \u201c \u2018 \u201cterminates the litigation between the\nparties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done\nbut to enforce by execution what has been determined.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 288, 304.) The\norder approving the rehabilitation plan fits this description, since\nthe only thing remaining after that order is the execution of the\nplan, at the end of which CIC will merge with CIC II and cease to\nexist as an independent entity. We therefore agree with CIC that\nthe order approving the rehabilitation plan is appealable, and we\n\n3 In particular, interim orders involving the conservator\u2019s\n\nmanagement of the conserved insurer would likely not be\nappealable. For example, in this case CIC moved to modify the\nconservatorship order and to vacate the conservatorship. CIC\nnoted in its petition for writ of mandate challenging those orders\nthat they were not appealable. Similarly, an order allowing\ndiscovery, like the one the trial court entered here, or an order\napproving the commissioner\u2019s fixing of expenses of\nconservatorship, to be paid out of the assets of the conserved\ninsurer (\u00a7 1035, subd. (a)), would likely not be appealable under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(1). Any\nchallenge to such orders would have to be pursued by writ\npetition or in an appeal from the order approving the\nrehabilitation plan or otherwise ending the conservatorship.\n\fdecline the commissioner\u2019s invitation to treat the appeal as a writ\nproceeding.\n II. Standard of Review\n The commissioner placed CIC in conservatorship and\nproposed the rehabilitation plan pursuant to authority under\nsection 1011(c). \u201cThe statutory authority he exercises in that\neffort is an aspect of the police power of the state. It is\nsubstantial in its scope, but not boundless. Its basic parameters\nwere described by our Supreme Court over [85] years ago in\nCarpenter v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., supra, 10 Cal.2d at page\n329: \u2018The only restriction on the exercise of this power is that the\nstate\u2019s action shall be reasonably related to the public interest\nand shall not be arbitrary or improperly discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d\n(Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th\n393, 398.) As the parties here both recognize, this has been held\nto require a trial court to review a commissioner\u2019s action \u201cunder\nthe abuse of discretion standard [citation]: was the action\narbitrary, i.e., unsupported by a rational basis, or is it contrary to\nspecific statute, a breach of the fiduciary duty of the conservator\nas trustee, or improperly discriminatory?\u201d (In re Executive Life\nIns. Co. (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 344, 358.) On appeal, \u201c[w]e also\ntest the action of the trial court by the abuse of discretion\nstandard. [Citation.] In this connection we employ the\nequivalent of the substantial evidence test by accepting the trial\ncourt\u2019s resolution of credibility and conflicting substantial\nevidence, and its choice of possible reasonable inferences.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\f III. Analysis\n CIC challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of the\nconservatorship in the first place, its refusal to vacate it, and its\napproval of the rehabilitation plan that would now end it. We\nconsider each argument in turn.\n A. Imposition of the conservatorship\n CIC contends the conservatorship was unlawfully imposed\nbecause there have never been any concerns about CIC\u2019s solvency\nor financial condition. 4 CIC\u2019s argument rests on the interplay of\nsection 1011, which authorizes conservatorships of insurers, and\nsections 1215.2, 1215.10, 1215.12, and 1215.16, which concern\nacquisitions or mergers of insurers. While CIC\u2019s argument is not\ncomplicated, to follow it one must first understand the operation\nof the relevant statutes.\n Section 1011 states that the \u201csuperior court of the county in\nwhich the principal office of a person [purporting to do insurance\nbusiness] is located, upon the filing by the commissioner of the\nverified application showing any of the conditions in this\nsubdivision exist, . . . shall issue its order vesting title to all of the\nassets of that person, wheresoever situated, in the commissioner\nor his or her successor in office, in his or her official capacity, and\n\n4 The commissioner argues in a footnote that CIC cannot\n\nargue that a conservation based on an unapproved attempt to\nmerge also requires the threat of insolvency because CIC did not\nraise that issue below. We need not respond to arguments raised\nonly in a footnote. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)\n43 Cal.App.5th 404, 419 [\u201cAn appellant cannot bury a substantive\nlegal argument in a footnote and hope to avoid waiver of that\nargument.\u201d].)\n\fdirect the commissioner . . . to conduct, as conservator, the\nbusiness of the person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011; see \u00a7 1010 [conservatorship\nstatutes apply to, among others, all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state\u201d].) The list of circumstances\nsupporting a conservatorship includes \u201c[t]hat the person, without\nfirst obtaining the consent in writing of the commissioner, has\ntransferred, or attempted to transfer, substantially its entire\nproperty or business or, without consent, has entered into any\ntransaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate, or\nreinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with\nthe property or business of any other person.\u201d (\u00a7 1011(c).) It also\nincludes the circumstance \u201c[t]hat the person is found, after an\nexamination, to be in a condition that makes its further\ntransaction of business hazardous to its policyholders, or\ncreditors, or to the public.\u201d (Id., subd. (d).) The Legislature\nenacted section 1011 in 1935, and the wording of these triggering\nconditions for a conservatorship remains substantively\nunchanged since then. (Stats. 1935, ch. 145, \u00a7 1011, p. 540.)\n In 1969, the Legislature added article 4.7 to division 1, part\n2, chapter 2 of the Insurance Code and titled it the \u201cInsurance\nHolding Company System Regulatory Act.\u201d (Stats. 1969,\nch. 1275, \u00a7 1, pp. 2487\u20132488.) As relevant here, section 1215.2,\nsubdivision (a) states, \u201cA person shall not make a tender offer for,\nor a request or invitation for tenders of, or enter into an\nagreement to exchange securities for or acquire in the open\nmarket, any voting security, or any security convertible into a\nvoting security, of a domestic insurer or of any other person\n\fcontrolling a domestic insurer, if the other person is not\nsubstantially engaged either directly or through its affiliates in\nany businesses other than that of insurance, if, as a result of the\nconsummation thereof, the person would, directly or indirectly,\nacquire control of the insurer, and a person shall not enter into\nan agreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer, unless, at the time copies of the offer, purchase,\nrequest, or invitation are first published, sent, or given to\nsecurity holders or the agreement or transaction is entered into,\nas the case may be, the person has filed with the commissioner,\nand has sent to the insurer, a statement containing\u201d certain\ninformation. The required disclosures include the backgrounds\nand identities of everyone on whose behalf the transaction is to\nbe effected; the source of the funds to be used; and any plans or\nproposals to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or merge it.\n(\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (a)(1)\u2013(5).)\n Section 1215.2, subdivision (d) states, \u201cThe purchases,\nexchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control referred to in\nsubdivision (a) may not be made until the commissioner approves\nthe purchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of\ncontrol. The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the\ntransaction on or before the latter of 60 days after the statement\nrequired by subdivision (a) has been filed with the commissioner\nor, if a hearing is held pursuant to subdivision (f), 30 days after\nthe close of the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f).\u201d The\nstatute then lists reasons why the commissioner may disapprove\nthe transaction. (\u00a7 1215.2, subd. (d)(1)\u2013(5).)\n\f Section 1215.10, subdivision (a) allows the commissioner to\napply for an injunction when it appears to the commissioner that\nan insurer \u201chas committed or is about to commit a violation\u201d of\nthe Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act. Section\n1215.12 states in full, \u201cWhenever it appears to the commissioner\nthat any person has committed a violation of this article which so\nimpairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to\nthreaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business\nby it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or\nthe public, then the commissioner may proceed as provided in\nArticle 14 (commencing with Section 1010) of Chapter 1 of this\npart to take possession of the property of the domestic insurer\nand to conduct the business thereof.\u201d Finally, section 1215.16\nstates in full, \u201cAll laws and parts of laws of this state inconsistent\nwith this article are hereby superseded with respect to matters\ncovered by this article.\u201d\n CIC\u2019s argument based on these statutes takes two forms,\neach of them straightforward. CIC first argues narrowly that the\ncommissioner\u2019s conservatorship application alleged violations of\nsection 1215.2 to justify the conservatorship, so the\ncommissioner\u2019s failure to identify any financial impairment\nmeans his application did not satisfy section 1215.12\u2019s\nrequirements for a conservatorship. This is incorrect. The first\nsentence of the commissioner\u2019s application states that the\napplication rests on section 1011. The application later alleges\nrepeatedly that Menzies\u2019 attempt to merge CIC with CIC II\njustified a conservatorship under section 1011. The\n\fcommissioner unambiguously relied on his authority under\nsection 1011, not section 1215.12. The application does further\nallege that the attempted merger without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval also violated section 1215.2. But these further\nallegations do not undermine or disclaim the reliance on section\n1011, so the commissioner\u2019s application properly relied on his\nauthority under that statute.\n CIC also argues more broadly that the Legislature limited\nthe reach of section 1011(c) \u2014 which CIC terms a historic,\ngeneral statutory provision \u2014 when it enacted what CIC calls the\nspecific, remedial structure for unauthorized mergers in article\n4.7. CIC contends that by specifying in section 1215.12 that the\ncommissioner can impose a conservatorship under section 1011\nand related statutes for an unauthorized merger that \u201cso impairs\nthe financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten\ninsolvency or make the further transaction of business by it\nhazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the\npublic\u201d and enacting section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision, the\nLegislature repealed the broader authorization of\nconservatorships in section 1011(c) for any unauthorized merger.\nAccording to CIC, if an authorized merger does not so impair the\nfinancial condition of an insurer that it threatens insolvency or\nmakes the operation of the insurer hazardous, then the\ncommissioner may not impose a conservatorship and may only\npursue injunctive relief.\n We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended section\n1215.16 to expressly repeal section 1011(c), as CIC contends.\n\fMost obviously, section 1011 remains in effect; the bill that\nenacted sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 did not repeal section\n1011(c). Section 1215.16\u2019s supersession provision is not to the\ncontrary. Section 1215.12 invokes the conservatorship\nproceedings under section 1010 and following sections, so the\nLegislature intended those statutes to remain in effect. It would\nbe strange for the Legislature to allow section 1011(c) to remain\nin force, authorizing a conservatorship whenever an insurer\nattempts to merge its business without permission, while\nobliquely limiting it through sections 1215.12 and 1215.16 to\nauthorize a conservatorship only when a merger creates a risk of\nfinancial impairment. It would be particularly strange to do so\nwhile leaving section 1011, subdivision (d) in effect, which\nauthorizes a conservatorship whenever an insurer is found to be\nin a hazardous condition. A far more natural method of\nachieving the purpose that CIC ascribes to the Legislature would\nhave been to add the requirement of financial impairment to\nsection 1011(c), but the Legislature did not do this.\n Although CIC protests that section 1215.16 makes this a\nquestion of express repeal, in actuality CIC\u2019s argument is one of\nimplied repeal. \u201cRepeals by implication are disfavored.\u201d (Lopez\nv. Sony Electronics, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 627, 637.)\n\u201c \u2018Notwithstanding the \u201cpresumption against repeals by\nimplication,\u201d repeal may be found where (1) \u201cthe two acts are so\ninconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation,\u201d\nor (2) \u201cthe later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent\nto supersede the earlier\u201d provision.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because \u201cthe\n\fdoctrine of implied repeal provides that the most recently enacted\nstatute expresses the will of the Legislature\u201d [citation],\napplication of the doctrine is appropriate in those limited\nsituations where it is necessary to effectuate the intent of\ndrafters of the newly enacted statute. \u201c \u2018In order for the second\nlaw to repeal or supersede the first, the former must constitute a\nrevision of the entire subject, so that the court may say that it\nwas intended to be a substitute for the first.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Wishnev v. The\nNorthwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. (2019) 8 Cal.5th 199, 211.)\n As the commissioner points out, section 1215.12 is easy to\nharmonize with section 1011(c). The conservatorship statutes,\nincluding section 1011, apply to all persons \u201cpurporting to do\ninsurance business in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1010.) Section 1011(c)\nallows for a conservatorship of an insurer based on an attempted\nmerger without requiring a showing of insolvency or financial\nhazard.\n Section 1215.12, meanwhile, applies to a broader group\nthan just insurers, but allows for conservatorships in narrower\ncircumstances. Section 1215.12 allows the commissioner to place\nan insurer in a conservatorship when it appears to the\ncommissioner that \u201cany person\u201d has violated section 1215.2 or\nother statutes in a way that impairs the financial condition of an\ninsurer that threatens insolvency or makes the insurer\u2019s further\noperation hazardous. Section 1215.2, subdivision (a), among\nother things, prohibits a \u201cperson\u201d from making a tender offer or\nrequesting or inviting tenders for securities of an insurer or a\n\u201cperson\u201d controlling an insurer, or from \u201center[ing] into an\n\fagreement to merge with or otherwise to acquire control of a\ndomestic insurer\u201d unless, when the offer, request, or agreement is\nmade, the required information has been filed with the\ncommissioner. Section 1215.2 further provides that such\n\u201cpurchases, exchanges, mergers, or other acquisitions of control\u201d\nmay not be made without the commissioner\u2019s approval. (Id.,\nsubd. (d).) \u201cPerson\u201d is defined for both of these sections to include\nany individual or other entity. (\u00a7 1215, subd. (m).) Because\nsection 1215.12 applies to non-insurers and prohibits anyone\nfrom even offering to buy an insurer without satisfying the\nstatutory requirements, it makes sense that the Legislature\nwould limit conservatorships based on violations of such\nrequirements to those that threaten the solvency or safe\noperation of the insurer.\n The Legislature\u2019s limitation of the scope of the remedy for\nits new requirements applicable to non-insurers does not mean\nthat it also intended to limit the scope of the existing remedy\napplicable only to insurers. When an insurer violates section\n1215.2 by agreeing to merge, as CIC did, it triggers the provision\nin section 1011(c), even if that agreement did not also trigger\nsection 1215.12 because it did not threaten the insurer\u2019s solvency\nor make its continued operation hazardous. Because sections\n1215.2 and 1215.12 are not incompatible with section 1011(c),\nevince no intent to supersede section 1011(c), and did not revise\nthe entire subject of conservatorships of insurers, but rather\nadded a more limited conservatorship remedy for a broader set of\n\factors, we hold that section 1215.2 and 1215.12 did not expressly\nor impliedly repeal section 1011(c).\n CIC contends that the commissioner has only ever invoked\nsection 1011(c) for insurers in financial distress and cites various\ncases describing section 1011 conservatorships as the state\nequivalent of bankruptcy law for insurers. (E.g., State of\nCalifornia v. Altus Finance (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1295 [\u00a7 1011\n\u201cis part of . . . article 14,\u201d which \u201crelate[s] to the Commissioner\u2019s\ntreatment of insolvent insurers\u201d and is the \u201cequivalent of federal\nbankruptcy laws\u201d]; Financial Indemnity Co. v. Superior Court of\nLos Angeles (1955) 45 Cal.2d 395, 402 [\u201cThe primary purpose for\nthe drastic remedy [of conservatorship] . . . is to prevent\ndissipation of the assets of the company after the commissioner\nhas determined that a hazardous condition exists.\u201d].)\n We agree that this case appears to be the first decision\ndealing with a conservatorship involving an insurer not in\nfinancial distress. However, the absence of a precedent directly\non point demonstrates only that before CIC, solvent insurers\nwere careful to obtain the necessary approval before placing their\nbusiness at risk of conservatorship. While the conservatorship\nsystem does replace the bankruptcy system for insurers, who are\nexcluded from federal bankruptcy, that does not mean that only\nbankrupt or insolvent insurers can be placed under\nconservatorship. As our Supreme Court explained long ago in\nCarpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at page 329, \u201cIt is no longer open to\nquestion that the business of insurance is affected with a public\ninterest\u201d because \u201c[i]nsurance is a public asset, a basis of credit,\n\fand a vital factor in business activity.\u201d Carpenter involved an\ninsolvent insurer, but given the role insurance plays in the\neconomy and society, the public\u2019s interest in insurers and the\ninsurance industry extends beyond insolvency to ensuring that\ninsurers follow statutes and regulations enacted to protect\npolicyholders and the public.\n The plain language of section 1011(c) permits a\nconservatorship based on an attempted unauthorized merger\neven when the insurer involved is solvent, and it is not absurd for\nthe Legislature to intend to prohibit insurers from merging\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s consent, regardless of solvency\nquestions. We therefore follow the statute\u2019s plain language.\n(People v. Velador (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 687, 693 [if statutory\nlanguage is clear, courts must follow its plain meaning unless it\nwould result in absurd consequences that the Legislature did not\nintend].)\n B. Maintenance of the conservatorship\n CIC argues that even if the commissioner properly placed\nCIC under conservatorship based only on the attempted merger,\nthe commissioner and the trial court abused their discretion by\nnot vacating the conservatorship on CIC\u2019s motion when CIC\nagreed to an injunction prohibiting it from completing the\nmerger. CIC contends its offer to stipulate to an injunction made\nthe conservatorship unnecessary. It further contends the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to vacate the injunction failed to account for\nvarious facts, including that the merger was only necessary to\nsatisfy the Berkshire Hathaway deadline after the commissioner\n\frefused to approve or disapprove Menzies\u2019 application to acquire\nCIC due to concerns about the RPA litigation. CIC also asserts\nthat the department appeared at the New Mexico merger hearing\nand did not object, CIC complied when the commissioner asked it\nnot to file the certificate with the Secretary of State to complete\nthe merger in California, the commissioner failed to raise any\nconcerns about the RPA litigation during its consideration of\nMenzies\u2019 application to acquire CIC until days before the\nBerkshire Hathaway deadline, and CIC\u2019s assets and capital were\nmore than sufficient to address the maximum exposure from the\nRPA litigation.\n We reject CIC\u2019s argument for the same reasons that the\nNinth Circuit rejected the similar argument that the\nconservatorship proceeding was brought in bad faith. (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th 579.) As the Ninth\nCircuit explained, \u201cthe conservatorship action was brought for a\nlegitimate reason \u2014 indeed, [CIC\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019] own factual\nallegations make out a violation of \u00a7 1215.2(d) sufficient to\ntrigger a conservatorship under \u00a7 1011(c). The allegations make\nclear that [CIC and its affiliates] neither sought nor received\napproval from the [department] for the proposed purchase of the\ncontrolling interest in CIC I and the concomitant CIC I / CIC II\nmerger, as required by California Insurance Code \u00a7 1215.2(d),\nand that the merger was an obvious attempt to avoid the\nCalifornia insurance regulatory regime.\u201d (Id. at p. 597.) Given\nthat CIC created the RPA with the express intent of bypassing\nstate insurance regulations limiting the marketing of\n\fretrospective rating policies, the commissioner determined that\nthe RPA was unlawful and void, and that CIC attempted to\nmerge with an out-of-state entity a matter of days after the\ncommissioner raised concerns about CIC\u2019s litigation of suits\nbased on the void RPA, the commissioner could reasonably\ndetermine that it was necessary to place CIC under\nconservatorship to prevent CIC from pursuing any further\nschemes to dodge or stymie the commissioner\u2019s oversight, despite\nthe offer to stipulate to an injunction.\n The various facts that CIC cites, even if true, are beside the\npoint. Fundamentally, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, Menzies\n\u201cmade a $50 million bet with Berkshire Hathaway . . . that he\ncould complete the purchase of Berkshire [Hathaway]\u2019s\ncontrolling interest in CIC I by September 30, 2019.\u201d (Applied\nUnderwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 584.) The\ndeadline was not of the commissioner\u2019s making. Menzies lost the\nbet when the commissioner failed to approve the transaction by\nthe deadline Berkshire Hathaway set. The answer, then, was for\nMenzies to pay his loss by forfeiting the breakup fee (ibid.), not\nfor Menzies and CIC to try to seek to complete the transaction\nanyway by hurriedly redomesticating CIC within less than two\nweeks by merging with a newly created out-of-state entity\nwithout the commissioner\u2019s approval. Given CIC\u2019s demonstrated\nwillingness to flout the law for its own financial gain, the trial\ncourt and by extension the commissioner did not abuse their\ndiscretion by concluding that a conservatorship was necessary to\n\fensure CIC\u2019s compliance with the law, rather than acceding to\nCIC\u2019s preferred course of a stipulated injunction.\n This case is comparable in this regard to Caminetti v.\nGuaranty Union Life Ins. Co. (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 330. The\ncommissioner there placed an insurer in conservatorship because\nthe insurer\u2019s management was paying itself excessive salaries\nthat placed the insurer in a hazardous condition. (Id. at pp. 332\u2013\n335.) The insurer later argued that the trial court should have\nterminated the conservatorship because the insurer removed the\ngrounds for the conservatorship by voluntarily reducing the\nmanagement\u2019s salaries. (Id. at pp. 335\u2013336.) The Court of\nAppeal noted that the same management remained in control\nand found that the trial court or commissioner would only be\nwarranted in returning the company back to the management\u2019s\ncontrol if there was evidence that their state of mind had\nchanged. (Id. at p. 336.) The Court of Appeal deferred to the\ntrial court\u2019s conclusion, after taking evidence, that the\nmanagement \u201cshould not again be permitted to control the\ndestinies of the policyholders.\u201d (Ibid.) So, too, here, the court and\nthe commissioner would only have been obligated to terminate\nthe conservatorship if there were evidence that CIC\u2019s\nmanagement had changed its state of mind. We defer to the trial\ncourt\u2019s view that the stipulation to an injunction was insufficient,\ngiven the other evidence of CIC\u2019s intentionally evasive behavior.\n C. Rehabilitation plan to end the conservatorship\n CIC\u2019s remaining arguments challenge the terms of the\ncommissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan pursuant to which CIC can\n\fexit conservatorship, complete its merger with CIC II, and\nredomesticate in New Mexico.\n A conservatorship under section 1011 \u201ccontemplates, not\nthe liquidation of the company involved, but a conservation of the\nassets and business of the company over the period of stress by\nthe commissioner who thereafter yields the control and direction\nto the regular officers of the company.\u201d (Caminetti v. Superior\nCourt (1941) 16 Cal.2d 838, 843.) Section 1012 sets out the terms\nfor ending a conservatorship under section 1011. It states that\nwith one exception not relevant here, a conservatorship order\n\u201cshall continue in force and effect until, on the application either\nof the commissioner or of [the insurer under conservatorship], it\nshall, after a full hearing, appear to the court that the ground for\nthe order directing the commissioner to take title and possession\ndoes not exist or has been removed and that the person can\nproperly resume title and possession of its property and the\nconduct of its business.\u201d (\u00a7 1012.) \u201cIn order to effect\nrehabilitation, the Commissioner may enter into a court-\napproved rehabilitation agreement.\u201d (State of California v. Altus\nFinance, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1295; accord, \u00a7 1043 [\u201cthe\ncommissioner, as conservator or as liquidator, may, subject to the\napproval of said court, . . . mutualize or reinsure the business of\nsuch person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements\u201d]; Carpenter,\nsupra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 323 [\u201cwhen the commissioner files a\npetition to be appointed conservator and asks authority to work\nout a rehabilitation plan,\u201d the proceeding lasts \u201cuntil the\nproposed plan is ultimately passed upon\u201d].)\n\f Section 1043 does not delineate the scope of the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to enter into rehabilitation agreements,\nbut that authority is presumed to be limited by the provisions in\nthe other statutes governing the conservatorship proceedings in\nsections 1010\u20131062. (Commercial Nat. Bank v. Superior Court,\nsupra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 410.) One such statute is section\n1037, which lists various powers the commissioner has as the\nconservator of an insurer. Section 1037, subdivision (c) (section\n1037(c)) states that the commissioner \u201c[s]hall have authority to\ncompound, compromise or in any other manner negotiate\nsettlements of claims against that person upon such terms and\nconditions as the commissioner shall deem to be most\nadvantageous to the estate of the person being administered or\nliquidated or otherwise dealt with under this article.\u201d\n Because CIC sought to merge with an out-of-state entity\nand redomesticate in New Mexico, sections 1071.5 and 1072 are\nalso relevant here. Section 1071.5 states, \u201cEvery insurer which\nwithdraws as an insurer, or is required to withdraw as an\ninsurer, from this State shall, prior to such withdrawal, discharge\nits liabilities to residents of this State. In the case of its policies\ninsuring residents of this State it shall cause the primary\nliabilities under such policies to be reinsured and assumed by\nanother admitted insurer. In the case of such policies as are\nsubject to cancellation by the insurer, it may cancel such policies\npursuant to the terms thereof in lieu of such reinsurance and\nassumption.\u201d Section 1072 provides that if the commissioner\nexamines the books and records of a withdrawing insurer and\n\fdetermines that \u201cthe insurer has no outstanding liabilities to\nresidents of this State and no policies in favor of the residents of\nthis State uncanceled or the primary liabilities under which have\nnot been reinsured and assumed by another admitted insurer, as\nrequired by Section 1071.5, he shall cancel the insurer\u2019s\ncertificates of authority, if unexpired, and he shall permit the\ninsurer to withdraw. The commissioner may, in his discretion,\nwaive any or all of the above requirements if, after such\nexamination, he finds it to be in a solvent condition.\u201d\n 1. Section 2.6\u2019s settlement of the RPA litigation\n a. Relationship to basis for conservatorship\n CIC offers multiple reasons why the provision of the\nrehabilitation plan allowing CIC\u2019s policyholders to settle their\nclaims against CIC is legally unauthorized, but none has merit.\nMost generally, CIC contends the RPA litigation was not the\nbasis for the conservatorship and settlement of the RPA litigation\nis therefore not necessary to address the reasons for the\nconservatorship. The commissioner disputes whether section\n1012 requires each aspect of a rehabilitation plan to be limited to\nthe original grounds for the conservatorship, pointing out that\nsection 1012 states that a conservatorship ends when the court\nconcludes that the circumstances that gave rise to it no longer\nexist \u201cand that the person can properly resume title and\npossession of its property and the conduct of its business.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1012, italics added.) But he also maintains that settlement of\n\fthe RPA litigation is related to the grounds for the\nconservatorship.\n The language of section 1012 is broad, and the second\nclause is written in the present tense, suggesting that the\ncommissioner can include in a rehabilitation plan provisions\naimed at remediating flaws or issues he discovers in the\nconserved insurer during the course of the conservatorship that\nare not related to the reason for the conservatorship. But we\nneed not come to a definitive conclusion on this question.\nAssuming for the sake of argument that CIC is correct and a\nrehabilitation plan can only address the reasons for a\nconservatorship, the trial court and the commissioner reasonably\nconcluded that settlement of the RPA litigation does so. 5\n CIC attempted to merge without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval and depart the state because the commissioner refused\nto approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition of CIC. The Ninth Circuit\nrecently concluded as much, noting that Menzies merged CIC\nwith CIC II \u201cto bypass the California insurance regulatory regime\naltogether\u201d (Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th\nat pp. 584\u2013585) \u201cand that the merger was an obvious attempt to\navoid the California insurance regulatory regime\u201d (id. at p. 597).\nThe commissioner refused to approve Menzies\u2019 acquisition\n\n5 CIC argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the second\n\ncondition in section 1012 for termination of a conservatorship,\nthat the insurer can properly resume title and possession of its\nbusiness, violates state administrative law and due process.\nBecause we do not rely on this aspect of section 1012 to affirm the\ntrial court\u2019s order, we need not examine these arguments.\n\fbecause of concerns about the RPA litigation. If the\ncommissioner had not placed CIC in conservatorship, CIC could\nhave merged, thereby thwarting the commissioner\u2019s ability to\nsatisfy himself regarding CIC\u2019s liability under the RPA litigation.\nEnding the conservatorship without also addressing the\ncommissioner\u2019s concerns about the RPA litigation therefore would\nhave failed to remedy the motivation behind it. CIC asserts that\nthe merger was intended only to avoid collapse of the Berkshire\nHathaway deal due to the commissioner\u2019s refusal to approve or\ndisapprove the transaction, but its account ignores the substance\nof why that deal almost collapsed.\n b. Mandated departure\n CIC objects that its departure from California cannot\njustify section 2.6 because its departure is not voluntary but\nrather mandated by section 2.4 of the plan. 6 CIC did not object to\nsection 2.4 in the trial court and does not object to it on appeal, so\nthis argument is not well taken. CIC\u2019s claims about a mandated\ndeparture also belie the history of this case. CIC began the\nprocess of merging with CIC II and redomesticating to allow the\nBerkshire Hathaway transaction to close. The Berkshire\nHathaway transaction did close, which was one of the New\n\n6 Section 2.4 of the rehabilitation plan states that on the\n\ndate the reinsurance and assumption agreement takes effect, the\ncommissioner as conservator \u201cshall effectuate the merger of CIC\ninto and with\u201d CIC II, \u201cthereby completing the attempted\nredomestication of CIC from California to New Mexico, and upon\nthe effective date of the merger of CIC into and with CIC II and\nthe transfer of the domicile of CIC to New Mexico, CIC shall\ncease to be a California domestic insurer.\u201d\n\fMexico superintendent\u2019s conditions of approval of the merger.\nCIC II also satisfied the other condition, which was that CIC II\nfile articles of merger with the New Mexico secretary of state. All\nthat remains is the filing of the certificate of merger with the\nCalifornia secretary of state. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1108, subd. (d).) It is\nthus more accurate to say that sections 2.4 and 2.6 of the\nrehabilitation plan place conditions on the completion of the\ndeparture that is already under way.\n Given that CIC began the departure process without the\ncommissioner\u2019s approval and it is partly complete, the\ncommissioner is within his rights to place conditions on the\ncompletion of the departure. When an insurer follows the normal\nprocedure for withdrawal from the state by filing an application\nand surrendering its certificate to the commissioner (\u00a7 1070), the\n\u201cinsurer who has commenced the withdrawal process may not\nunilaterally terminate it and the Commissioner may condition\ntermination of the withdrawal process on appropriate remedial\naction by the insurer.\u201d (Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Gillespie\n(1990) 50 Cal.3d 82, 102 (Gillespie).) The commissioner must\nhave the same or greater authority over an insurer who is placed\nin conservatorship for attempting to extinguish its certificate\nthrough a merger and departure without the commissioner\u2019s\napproval. (See \u00a7 701 [an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority \u201cshall\nexpire with the expiration or termination of a corporate existence\nof the holder thereof\u201d].)\n\f c. Statutory basis\n According to CIC, section 1071.5, which the trial court cited\nas authority supporting section 2.6, is inapplicable for several\nreasons, including that the RPA litigation claims are not\n\u201cliabilities\u201d of CIC within the meaning of section 1071.5 and\nrequiring it to settle litigation as a condition of withdrawing from\nthe state would violate its constitutional rights.\n CIC\u2019s interpretation of section 1071.5 is dubious, but we\nneed not examine CIC\u2019s contentions in detail because the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority to fashion the rehabilitation plan does\nnot depend on section 1071.5. Section 1071.5 governs an\ninsurer\u2019s withdrawal from the state, so if CIC were simply trying\nto withdraw then section 1071.5 would govern. But CIC is not\nlike most withdrawing insurers. It is under conservatorship.\nSection 1037(c), which the trial court cited as supporting section\n2.6, allows the commissioner as conservator of an insurer to\n\u201ccompromise or in any other manner negotiate settlements of\nclaims against\u201d the conserved insurer. Sections 1012 and 1043\nalso empower the commissioner to enter into rehabilitation\nagreements to end a conservatorship. The commissioner\nreasonably concluded that settlement of the RPA litigation was\nnecessary to end the condition that gave rise to the\nconservatorship, as we concluded ante, so sections 1012, 1043,\nand 1037(c) provide sufficient authorization to support section\n2.6.\n CIC resists application of section 1037(c), arguing that\nstatute gives the commissioner authority to settle cases during\n\fthe conservatorship, not as a condition of exiting it. This gets\nthings backwards. As CIC itself notes, Commercial Nat. Bank v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at page 410 recognized\nthat the commissioner can reasonably exercise the state\u2019s police\npower and has authority under section 1043 to enter into\nrehabilitation agreements, subject to limitations in the other\nstatutes dealing with conservatorships. If section 1037(c)\nauthorizes settlements, that is no reason to think section 1043\ndoes not. CIC fails to show that the commissioner\u2019s section 1043\nauthority to use settlements to fashion a rehabilitation plan is\nnarrower than his section 1037(c) settlement authority during a\nconservatorship.\n d. Claims against affiliates\n CIC notes that section 1037(c) allows the commissioner as\nconservator to settle \u201cclaims against that person\u201d being\nconserved. It then argues that the RPA litigation mostly consists\nof claims against CIC\u2019s affiliates, not CIC itself. However, the\ncommissioner\u2019s authority in a conservatorship is not limited to\nthe entity being conserved. (Garamendi v. Executive Life Ins. Co.\n(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 504, 520, 523 (Garamendi).) A trial court\nmay assert in rem jurisdiction over assets of entities that have an\n\u201cidentity of interest\u201d with a conserved insurer and include them\nwithin the scope of the commissioner\u2019s rehabilitation plan for an\ninsurer if it is reasonably necessary to promote the insurer\u2019s\nrehabilitation. (Ibid.) Garamendi relied in part on the fact that\ninsurance conservatorships are a state law equivalent of\nbankruptcy and that federal bankruptcy law asserts jurisdiction\n\fover entities that are legally separate from the debtor where\nnecessary to the successful administration of a debtor\u2019s estate.\n(Id. at pp. 515\u2013517.) But Garamendi also emphasized that \u201cthe\nbusiness of insurance is affected with a public interest,\u201d\n\u201cinsurance is a public asset,\u201d and creditors, policyholders, and the\npublic have an important stake in preserving the business of\ninsurers. (Id. at pp. 515\u2013516.)\n As the trial court ruled, Garamendi\u2019s holding supports\nsection 2.6 of the plan here. While there is no indication that CIC\nis insolvent, the commissioner\u2019s authority springs from the same\nstatutes that allow conservatorships in cases of insolvency and\nthe public has an interest in regulation and legally sound\noperation of insurers like CIC. CIC is correct that neither the\ncommissioner nor the trial court found that CIC\u2019s affiliates were\nalter egos of CIC, and the relationship between CIC and its\naffiliates is not exactly the same as the entities at issue in\nGaramendi. But nothing in Garamendi conditioned its assertion\nof in rem jurisdiction on an alter ego finding, and its rationale\nbased on the public interest in insurers also applies here.\n(Garamendi, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 516\u2013520, 523.)\n CIC and its affiliates operated the RPA and EquityComp\nprograms as a joint enterprise, dividing obligations and authority\nfor the express purpose of avoiding regulation by the\ncommissioner, as the commissioner found in Shasta Linen and as\nother courts have concluded. (E.g., Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1116\u20131117 [agreeing with Shasta Linen\nthat CIC and its affiliates \u201cwere \u2018so enmeshed\u2019 and \u2018intertwined\u2019\n\fthat they should be considered together in determining whether\nthe RPA constitutes a modification of the CIC policies\u201d]; Luxor\nCabs, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 986 [viewing \u201cEquityComp as a\nsingle, integrated insurance program\u201d despite the distinctions\nbetween CIC and its affiliates]; Applied Underwriters, Inc. v.\nLara, supra, 37 F.4th at pp. 592\u2013593 [discussing Garamendi with\napproval].) As one of these courts noted, \u201cObviously, allowing an\ninsurer to circumvent the comprehensive regulatory structure\napplicable to the issuance of workers\u2019 compensation insurance in\nthis state simply by amending its approved policy forms through\na side agreement with a subsidiary is contrary to the public\npolicy underlying California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law and\ncannot be countenanced.\u201d (Luxor Cabs, at p. 986.) The RPA\nlitigation has reflected this integrated relationship between CIC\nand its affiliates, since in at least one case, a federal court\naffirmed an arbitration award requiring a policyholder to pay\npremiums to CIC, over the policyholder\u2019s objection that CIC was\nnot a party to the arbitration. (American, Etc., Inc. v. Applied\nUnderwriters Captive Risk Assurance Co. (N.D. Cal. Dec. 28,\n2017, No. 17-cv-03660 DMR) 2017 WL 6622993, at *3\u2013*5.) In\nthese circumstances, excluding the RPA litigation from the\nrehabilitation plan because plaintiffs sued one of the other\nentities involved in the joint EquityComp program besides CIC\nwould thwart the commissioner\u2019s authority to remedy the\nproblem that gave rise to the conservatorship.\n\f e. Most advantageous terms\n CIC contends that section 1037(c) only allows settlement of\nclaims \u201cupon such terms and conditions as the commissioner\nshall deem to be most advantageous to the estate of the person\nbeing administered\u201d (\u00a7 1037(c)) and asserts the trial court did not\nfind that section 2.6\u2019s three settlement options are to CIC\u2019s\nadvantage.\n CIC\u2019s statement of the standard governing settlements by\nan insurance conservator is incomplete. While section 1037(c)\nrequires settlements to be most advantageous to the estate,\nsection 1057 declares that when acting as a conservator, \u201cthe\ncommissioner shall be deemed to be a trustee for the benefit of all\ncreditors and other persons interested in the estate of the person\nagainst whom the proceedings are pending.\u201d And as In re\nExecutive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at page 376\nexplained, the commissioner\u2019s actions are also inflected with the\npublic interest, given the character of insurance and that the\ncommissioner \u201cacts not only as a trustee but also as a servant of\nthe state in the exercise of its police power.\u201d \u201cOf necessity, if\nrequired to satisfy the public interest, the Commissioner\npossesses considerable discretion in settling claims.\u201d (Id. at\np. 381.) Thus, when deciding whether a settlement of claims\nagainst a conserved insurer is \u201cboth in the best interest of the\nconservancy estate and necessary to vindicate the public interest\u201d\n(ibid.), the commissioner must consider not just the insurer itself,\nbut also others interested in the insurer, such as policyholders or\ncreditors, as well as the public interest at stake. Additionally,\n\feven when a settlement of one claim cannot be justified on its\nown, it may be justified if it is part of a global settlement or\ncontributes to a near global settlement. (Id. at p. 382.)\n The trial court quoted In re Executive Life Ins. Co.\u2019s\nstatement of the standard for settlements, described how section\n2.6 offered the possibility of a settlement of the substantial\nmajority of the RPA litigation, described in detail the substantial\nevidence supporting the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that CIC faced\nsignificant legal exposure in the litigation, and found section 2.6\nhad a rational basis in its entirety. The import of the trial court\u2019s\ndecision is that the commissioner reasonably concluded the\nsection 2.6 settlement options were most advantageous to the\npublic interest and the estate because of CIC\u2019s potential liability.\n Regarding CIC\u2019s potential liability, the trial court found\nsubstantial evidence supported the commissioner\u2019s belief that the\nRPA was void. Section 2.6\u2019s first settlement option reflects this\npossibility, since it would allow policyholders to settle by paying\nonly what they owe under the guaranteed cost policy. The trial\ncourt recognized that policyholders could also enforce the RPA,\ndespite its illegality, to prevent unjust enrichment to CIC.\nSection 2.6\u2019s third settlement option represents this possibility,\nsince it would allow policyholders to enforce the guaranteed cost\npolicies and the RPA in full, which might result in a payment to\nCIC.\n The trial court found that CIC could also be liable under\nthe Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.\n(UCL)) for engaging in unlawful acts based on the failure to file\n\fthe RPA for approval, unfair acts by using an unfiled insurance\npolicy that was not disclosed until after the policyholders were\nalready bound, and fraudulent practices by misrepresenting the\nEquityComp plan in marketing materials. The trial court found\nsection 2.6\u2019s second settlement option \u2014 which would allow\npolicyholders to obtain restitution of any amounts they paid over\nthe cost of a standard, approved retrospective rating plan \u2014 to be\na reasonable approach to calculating quantum meruit restitution,\nwhich would be a remedy for UCL violations.\n CIC does not mention, let alone dispute, any of the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusions regarding its potential liability under these\ntheories. Instead, it contends that a global settlement is not to\nCIC\u2019s advantage and violates its due process rights because CIC\ndefeated all attempts to certify classes of policyholders, the\nsettlement would prevent CIC from challenging each plaintiff\u2019s\nevidence, and it would require CIC to forfeit potentially\nmeritorious individual defenses, including showing that a\nplaintiff had suffered no damages. CIC also points out that its\nShasta Linen settlement with the department acknowledged that\nthe legality of the RPA was \u201cfor the courts to decide\u201d and asserts\nthat it prevailed in RPA litigation on numerous grounds.\n We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s and\ncommissioner\u2019s conclusions that CIC faces significant enough\nliability under the RPA litigation that it is most advantageous to\nCIC, policyholders, creditors, and the public for the commissioner\nto offer to settle on the terms in section 2.6. (See In re Executive\nLife Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 358 [courts must affirm\n\frehabilitation plan if it is not arbitrary, discriminatory, contrary\nto a specific statute, or a breach of the conservator\u2019s fiduciary\nduty as trustee].)\n The Shasta Linen settlement\u2019s statement about the courts\ndeciding the legality of the RPA is of no consequence, since it\npredated CIC\u2019s attempted unauthorized merger to evade the\ncommissioner\u2019s consideration of the RPA litigation and the\nresulting conservatorship. The settlement also reserved the\ncommissioner\u2019s right to \u201cinitiate any legal or administrative\nproceeding, to take any action permitted by law and to seek and\nobtain all relief and remedies available (including any fine or\npenalties) or to adjudicate the right of others, as otherwise\npermitted by law.\u201d Nothing in the settlement precludes section\n2.6.\n The trial court considered CIC\u2019s claim of substantial\nsuccess in the RPA litigation and reasonably found it\nunpersuasive. CIC did prevail in defeating class certification\nmotions, but those rulings have no bearing on the merits of any\nindividual policyholder\u2019s claims. The fact that the RPA litigants\nwere unable to satisfy the procedural requirements for class\naction due to individualized issues, as CIC asserts, is irrelevant\nto deciding whether the global settlement and the application of\nthe three settlement options is in CIC\u2019s interest. Section 2.6 does\nnot vitiate CIC\u2019s class certification victories in any event. The\npolicyholders eligible to settle under section 2.6 are those who\nalready filed claims, those whom CIC identifies as potentially\nowing CIC payments, and ten policyholders who had already\n\fsubmitted claims to the conservator. CIC does not contend that\nthese categories encompass the same number of policyholders\nthat a class action would have.\n Apart from class certification motions, the victories CIC\ncites primarily concern enforcement of arbitrability delegation or\nforum selection clauses in courts in other states or piecemeal\ndismissals of individual causes of action. These limited successes\ndo not show that CIC has a strong likelihood of ultimately\ndefeating policyholders\u2019 suits as a whole. The record as a whole\ncontains substantial evidence that policyholders prevailed more\noften in showing the RPA, or portions of it, to be void and\nunenforceable, especially after the issuance of the Court of\nAppeal decisions beginning with Nielsen Contracting, supra,\n22 Cal.App.5th 1096. CIC points out that the Court of Appeal\ndecisions the trial court cited concern the enforceability of the\narbitration agreement within the RPA, rather than the RPA\nitself. (E.g., id. at p. 1121, fn. 6 [decision was limited to factual\nrecord on the hearing on motion to compel and did not preclude\nparties from litigating merits of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action\nregarding the RPA].) This argument ignores that the same\ngrounds for invalidating an arbitration agreement within a\ncontract can provide a stronger basis for invalidating the entire\ncontract. (Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S.\n63, 71 [\u201cIn some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the\ncontract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the\nsame basis as applied only to the severable agreement to\n\farbitrate\u201d].) Moreover, other decisions the commissioner cited\ndeclared the entire RPA invalid.\n CIC notes that some decisions have found a policyholder\nliable for unpaid premiums regardless of the RPA\u2019s illegality.\n(E.g., Applied Underwriting, Inc. v. Top\u2019s Personnel, Inc. (D. Neb.\nAug. 2, 2018, No. 8:15-CV-90) 2018 WL 3675242, at *3\u2013*4.)\nAgain, there are decisions going the other direction.\nAdditionally, litigation of many of the cases was stayed because\nof the initiation of the conservatorship. Given that the\nEquityComp system was structured as a combination of the\nguaranteed cost policies and the RPA and that the commissioner\nsupplied an actuary\u2019s opinion that CIC\u2019s guaranteed cost\npremiums were roughly 33 percent higher than market rates, the\ntrial court could reasonably conclude that courts or arbitrators in\nthe future (including appellate courts, in cases where CIC had\nprevailed or would likely prevail in a lower court) would find it\nunfair and inequitable to enforce just the guaranteed cost plan\nrates after finding the RPA to be illegal. 7\n\n7 CIC disputes the 33 percent figure, claiming the actuary\n\nonly said in his deposition that the 33 percent figure was his\n\u201cimpression\u201d and relied on no data. CIC also notes that it\nprovided an actuarial expert\u2019s analysis that found CIC\u2019s rates\nwere in the middle of the market. But the department\u2019s actuary\nexplained elsewhere that CIC\u2019s rates were based on the loss\ntrends of its policy portfolio and those loss trends were higher\nthan the loss trends for the industry as a whole. The department\nalso noted in its reply that CIC\u2019s actuarial analysis was based on\nfiled rates, not the rates CIC actually charged, and did not reflect\nthat CIC\u2019s rates were higher than the industry-wide average\ndespite CIC not insuring policyholders with the highest losses.\n\f In short, the evidence from CIC and the commissioner\ndemonstrates at best that CIC has had limited success in the\nRPA litigation. This is not sufficient to show an abuse of\ndiscretion by the trial court or commissioner in finding section\n2.6\u2019s settlement options to be most advantageous to CIC\u2019s estate\nand interested third parties. Considering California\u2019s strong\npublic policy favoring the settlement of disputes (Rheinhart v.\nNissan North America, Inc. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1027)\nand the costs of litigation, the trial court could reasonably\ndetermine that settlement was beneficial to CIC here, especially\nbecause it would expedite the end of the conservatorship.\nAdditionally, settlement of a claim that may not be justified on\nits own can be justified as part of a global or near-global\nsettlement. (In re Executive Life Ins. Co., supra, 32 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 382.) Even if CIC might have defeated some of the RPA\ncases on the merits based on individualized defenses or had a net\nrecovery after some plaintiffs\u2019 damages were offset against\npremiums still owing to CIC or its affiliates, the trial court and\ncommissioner reasonably decided that it was most advantageous\nto achieve a near-global settlement, with the resulting litigation\ncost savings, by offering the three settlement options in section\n2.6.\n\nThe department\u2019s analysis constitutes substantial evidence, so\nthe trial court was entitled to decide which of these competing\nanalyses it found most persuasive.\n\f f. More favorable settlement\n CIC challenges option 2 specifically as offering RPA\nplaintiffs a more favorable outcome than they could have\nobtained through litigation because it calculates the fair market\nvalue of the benefits under the EquityComp plan by using a\ngeneral retrospective rating plan rather than one that CIC\noffered. Option 2 represents the commissioner\u2019s attempt to use a\ngeneric retrospective policy approved by the commissioner to\ncalculate the fair market value of the coverage a policyholder\nreceived from CIC, which CIC would be entitled to retain under\nthe UCL even if a plaintiff prevailed. As the trial court noted,\nfair market value is commonly defined as that amount \u201cthat\n\u2018hypothetical buyers and sellers\u2019 would pay in a \u2018hypothetical\ntransaction.\u2019 \u201d (Long Beach Memorial Medical Center v. Kaiser\nFoundation Health Plan, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 323, 343, 345\n[discussing measure of damages under quantum meruit claim,\nwhich was identical to restitution under UCL]; see also id. at\np. 346 [defining fair market value based on hypothetical\ntransactions \u201cis affirmatively helpful because it emphasizes\nanother pertinent legal principle \u2014 namely, that the parties\u2019\nprior actual transactions are not dipositive\u201d].) Option 2 therefore\nrepresents a reasonable approximation of a remedy that RPA\nplaintiffs might obtain through litigation, but it avoids the costs\nof litigation CIC would otherwise incur.\n 2. Reinsurance of CIC\u2019s policies under section 2.2\n Besides section 2.6\u2019s settlement options for the RPA\nlitigation, CIC also challenges the trial court\u2019s approval of section\n\f2.2 of the plan, which requires CIC to enter into a reinsurance\nand assumption agreement for its California policies. \u201cA\nreinsurance contract is \u2018one by which an insurer procures a third\nperson to insure him [i.e., the insurer] against loss or liability by\nreason of such original insurance.\u2019 (\u00a7 620.) If the agreement is\npurely for reinsurance, it benefits only the insurer; the original\ninsured has no interest in it (\u00a7 623) and acquires no rights under\nit. [Citation.] Such an agreement clearly cannot operate to\nrelieve the original insurer of any obligation to the insured. [\u00b6] A\ncontract by which a reinsurer assumes the policies of the original\ninsurer does result in the reinsurer being directly liable to the\noriginal insureds [citation], but it does not release the original\ninsurer, which remains jointly obligated with the reinsurer\n[citations.].\u201d (Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at pp. 95\u201396, italics\nomitted.)\n CIC\u2019s first argument is that section 2.2 improperly requires\nthe sale of over 85 percent of its business to end the\nconservatorship, which is tantamount to liquidation. CIC points\nout that liquidation is supposed to be the last resort in a\nconservatorship. (Carpenter, supra, 10 Cal.2d at p. 329.) But\nliquidation entails distributing an insurer\u2019s assets to creditors,\nand it is a last resort because it dissolves the company and\ndeprives policyholders of insurance protection. (Ibid.) CIC, by\ncontrast, will retain any proceeds from the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement, rather than distributing them to its\ncreditors, so section 2.2 is not a liquidation. Section 2.2 also does\n\fnot deprive any policyholders of insurance protection, so it need\nnot be a last resort like liquidation.\n Although CIC briefly suggests otherwise, reinsurance is\nwithin the commissioner\u2019s express authority as conservator.\nSection 1043 states that \u201cthe commissioner, as conservator or as\nliquidator, may, subject to the approval of said court, and subject\nto such liens as may be necessary mutualize or reinsure the\nbusiness of such person, or enter into rehabilitation agreements.\u201d\nThere can be no question that the commissioner has the\nnecessary authority.\n CIC claims that the commissioner could have pursued less\nonerous alternatives, including allowing CIC to continue to\nservice its policies after leaving the state. As noted ante, CIC\u2019s\nattempted merger with CIC II would have led to it departing\nfrom California, functionally equivalent to a withdrawal from the\nstate. Before withdrawing from the state, an insurer must\n\u201cdischarge its liabilities to residents of this State,\u201d including\ncausing its policies \u201cto be reinsured and assumed by another\nadmitted insurer.\u201d (\u00a7 1071.5.) The commissioner will then cancel\nthe withdrawing insurer\u2019s certificates of authority and allow the\ninsurer to withdraw. (\u00a7 1072.) Section 1072 gives the\ncommissioner discretion to waive this requirement if he finds the\nwithdrawing insurer to be solvent. (Ibid.)\n The default assumption of sections 1071.5 and 1072 is that\na withdrawing insurer will have its remaining policies reinsured\nand assumed by an admitted insurer. The commissioner\nreasonably decided to the take the same approach with CIC given\n\fthat its merger was functionally a withdrawal from the state.\nCIC protests that Gillespie, supra, 50 Cal.3d at page 99 held that\nan insurer that withdraws can still service its policies from out of\nstate, as demonstrated by the fact that section 1072 allows the\ncommissioner to waive the reinsurance and assumption\nrequirement for a solvent insurer. This is true, but the\ncommissioner still retains the discretion over whether to waive\nthe reinsurance and assumption requirement. (\u00a7 1072 [\u201cThe\ncommissioner may, in his discretion, waive any or all of the above\nrequirements . . . \u201d].) The trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin not requiring the commissioner to waive the presumptive\nrequirement of reinsurance and assumption here, where CIC\nattempted to merge and depart from California without the\ncommissioner\u2019s consent and with the purpose of evading the\ncommissioner\u2019s review of its handling of the RPA litigation. 8\n(Applied Underwriters, Inc. v. Lara, supra, 37 F.4th at p. 597\n[CIC merger \u201cwas an obvious attempt to avoid the California\ninsurance regulatory regime\u201d].)\n In its second challenge to section 2.2, CIC argues the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by approving the specific provision\nthat requires that any reinsurer who is affiliated with CIC, such\nas Continental, to use a third-party claims administrator. CIC\n\n8 The trial court also found the reinsurance and assumption\n\nrequirement justified based on evidence that CIC\u2019s management\nhad repeatedly evaded the commissioner\u2019s regulatory authority,\nboth before and during the conservatorship. Much, if not all, of\nthe evidence of this evasion provides further support for the trial\ncourt\u2019s order, but it is not necessary to consider it because CIC\u2019s\nconduct giving rise to the conservatorship is sufficient on its own.\n\fargues that the department proposed the third-party\nadministrator condition for a CIC-affiliated reinsurer without\nevidence to support it and then tried and failed to justify it\nretroactively.\n The trial court found the commissioner reasonably insisted\non a third-party claims administrator if Continental or another\nCIC affiliate reinsured and assumed CIC\u2019s policies, based in part\non the fact that Continental is operated by the same management\nas CIC, including Menzies as the president and chief executive\nofficer. The trial court also found substantial evidence showed\nthat CIC had not treated policyholders fairly by (1) increasing\npayouts on claims or inflating the reserves necessary for claims,\nthereby triggering higher costs for policyholders; and (2) keeping\nclaims open to postpone having to return unused premiums to the\npolicyholders, so that CIC could maximize the investment returns\nit made on the funds.\n We find substantial evidentiary support for all three points.\nFirst, the record shows that Menzies is Continental\u2019s president\nand chief executive officer and Jeffrey Silver is its Secretary.\nMenzies and Silver hold similar roles in CIC as well as AUCRA,\nwhich is another of the entities involved in the RPA and the\nEquityComp program. Given the identical management,\nallowing Continental to reinsure and assume CIC\u2019s policies and\ncontinue servicing claims would defeat the reinsurance and\nassumption agreement\u2019s purpose of protecting policyholders from\nmanagement that has demonstrated its willingness to attempt to\nevade the commissioner\u2019s oversight. It would essentially change\n\fthe nameplate on the door but allow the business to continue to\noperate as usual. This alone is sufficient to support the third-\nparty administrator requirement.\n Second, the commissioner submitted evidence showing that\nthe EquityComp program incentivized CIC to increase payments\nor reserves for claims unnecessarily and that CIC in fact did so.\nRegarding the incentive, most retrospective rating plans increase\nthe premiums a policyholder pays linearly as losses increase, up\nto a maximum premium. But the EquityComp plan increased\npremiums steeply for the initial portion of losses to a certain\namount, then raised premiums more slowly if losses continued to\nincrease. If CIC overpaid claims and thereby increased its losses,\nor if it set an artificially high estimate of reserves necessary to\npay losses on a claim in the future, it could trigger the initial\nsteep increase in premiums that policyholders would have to pay.\nCounsel for plaintiffs in many of the RPA cases, Larry J.\nLichtenegger, submitted a declaration detailing specific instances\nin which CIC\u2019s overpayment of employee claims increased\npolicyholders\u2019 costs, including one in which a putatively injured\nformer employee was working for a competitor, and CIC verified\nthe fraud but continued paying the former employee. The\ncommissioner also cited the Shasta Linen case, which relayed a\npolicyholder\u2019s account of CIC\u2019s failure to investigate potential\nfraud on a claim that cost the policyholder over $100,000.\n(Shasta Linen, supra, at p. 38.)\n Finally, the commissioner provided evidence that CIC kept\nclaims open to retain policyholders\u2019 funds longer, to maximize\n\fCIC\u2019s profits. The EquityComp program was structured to allow\nAUCRA (the CIC-affiliated reinsurer that took risk and\npremiums from CIC and passed them back to the policyholders)\nto require policyholders to post collateral to secure their payment\nof additional premiums due to losses. Setting high collateral\namounts for future losses benefited CIC and its affiliates because\nCIC could earn investment returns on the collateral and did not\nhave to share the returns with the policyholders. CIC followed\nthese incentives in several cases documented in Lichtenegger\u2019s\ndeclaration. For example, CIC refused to accept an employee\u2019s\noffer to settle a claim for less than the amount of reserves set\naside for the claim, even though the policyholder, which would\nincur the cost for the settlement, wanted to pay it in order to\nhave CIC refund the excess reserves.\n In response to this evidence, CIC cites evidence that the\ndepartment allowed CIC to continue to handle claims during the\nconservatorship and CIC was rated highly in claims handling in\nstate audits. CIC also attacks Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility,\nasserting, among other things, that he and his clients were\nobviously self-interested and arguing that he cited very few\nspecific examples of claims handling. Finally, CIC argues,\nprimarily in a footnote, that it submitted a declaration by an\nexpert who reviewed CIC\u2019s files for the policyholders mentioned\nand refuted Lichtenegger\u2019s allegations.\n The trial court reasonably rejected or discounted CIC\u2019s\narguments. The commissioner could reasonably conclude that his\noversight and that of his representatives, including being\n\fphysically present at CIC\u2019s offices in Nebraska, were sufficient to\ndeter CIC from its prior abusive practices. CIC\u2019s high marks in\naudits of its claims handling do not undercut the commissioner\u2019s\nevidence of overpayments. As the trial court noted, the audits\nlooked for evidence of underpayments, not overpayments, so\nCIC\u2019s high scores do not refute the evidence that CIC was\noverpaying claims to collect higher premiums from its\npolicyholders. And Lichtenegger\u2019s declaration did not purport to\nprovide an exhaustive description of all of his clients\u2019 qualms\nabout CIC\u2019s claims handling, so the quantity of examples he cited\nis not disqualifying. Although Lichtenegger\u2019s credibility was\nlegitimately open to question for various reasons (including his\nposition as advocate for policyholders with RPA litigation claims\nagainst CIC), credibility decisions were for the trial court and the\ncommissioner to make. The court and commissioner could\nreasonably decide to rely on Lichtenegger, given his unique\nfamiliarity with the experiences of many different policyholders.\nAlthough CIC\u2019s expert declaration provided the trial court an\nalternative view of the evidence, the trial court was ultimately\nfaced with conflicting evidence on both sides, and CIC\u2019s evidence\nrelating to its claims handling was not so overwhelming as to\nundercut the value of the commissioner\u2019s evidence as a matter of\nlaw.\n In sum, we are unpersuaded that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by approving section 2.2.\n DISPOSITION\n The trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\n\f BROWN, P.

ECF Nos. 50; 52. Defendant, the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d),\n\nopposes the Motion. ECF No. 51. Because Eddington fails to show he is eligible for attorneys\u2019\n\nfees, the Court recommends that Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nEddington is a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, which he refers to as \u201ca leading think\n\ntank dedicated to promoting individual liberty.\u201d Decl. of Patrick G. Eddington, ECF No. 50-1 \u00b6\u00b6\n\n3\u20134. Eddington\u2019s research and publications focus on domestic surveillance and political\n\nrepression. Id. \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Eddington filed a FOIA request with the National Security Division\n\n(\u201cNSD\u201d) of the DOJ. Id. \u00b6 6. Eddington sought records from June 3, 2015, to May 15, 2019,\n\nconcerning the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective\n\nDiscipline Over Monitoring Act of 2015 (\u201cUSA FREEDOM\u201d). Id. at 4\u20135.1 According to\n Citations throughout this Report and Recommendation are to the page numbers in a filing\u2019s\nECF header.\n\fEddington, the Act placed conditions on the Government\u2019s collection of citizens\u2019\n\ntelecommunications metadata. Id. \u00b6 7. Eddington\u2019s FOIA request had two parts: \u201c1) internal or\n\nexternal reports on the efficacy of programs carried out under [USA FREEDOM], including\n\nsolicited or unsolicited feedback from agents or intelligence analysts, whether formal or informal\n\nin nature; and 2) any correspondence dealing with the termination or initiation of programs\n\nconducted under [USA FREEDOM].\u201d Id. at 4.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, the DOJ acknowledged receipt of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request. Id. at \u00b6\n\n10, 6. The DOJ informed Eddington that it processed requests \u201con a first-in, first-out basis.\u201d Id.\n\nat 6. The DOJ also noted that the processing time for Eddington\u2019s request would depend on the\n\ncomplexity of the request, whether the request involved sensitive information or many records,\n\nand whether the DOJ needed to consult with other agencies to process the request. Id.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nEddington filed suit less than a month later, on July 12, 2019. ECF No. 1. In the\n\nComplaint, he requested that the DOJ conduct a reasonable search and produce all non-exempt\n\nrequested records. Id. at 2\u20133. The DOJ answered the Complaint on August 27, 2019. ECF No.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, the Parties filed their first joint status report (\u201cJSR\u201d), in which the\n\nDOJ stated it was \u201cin the process of conducting its searches\u201d for responsive records. ECF No. 11\n\n\u00b6 2. The DOJ noted it had to seek those records from individual custodians, as there was no\n\ncentralized database. Id. The DOJ anticipated completing its search by October 31, 2019. Id. On\n\nthat date, the DOJ informed the Court that it had completed its search for part one of Eddington\u2019s\n\nFOIA request and found no responsive records. ECF No. 12 \u00b6 2. The Parties also discussed\n\nnarrowing part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request to exclude internal communications. ECF Nos.\n\f12 \u00b6 2; 13 \u00b6 2. The DOJ claimed that including those communications in its search would cause a\n\ndelay in any document production. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 2; 14 \u00b6 2. The Parties, however, did not reach\n\nan agreement on narrowing part two of the request. ECF Nos. 13 \u00b6 3; 14 \u00b6 3.\n\nIn January 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it estimated completing its search for\n\npart two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA request by March 3, 2020. ECF No. 14 \u00b6 4. On that date, the DOJ\n\ntold Eddington that it had completed its search and was reviewing results. ECF Nos. 51\u20131; 17 \u00b6\n\n4. The DOJ stated it would provide Eddington with another response by May 3, 2020. ECF No.\n\n51\u20131. On March 17, 2020, however, the agency informed the Court that the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nwould impact its ability to timely process records and issue a response. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 5.\n\nOn May 13, 2020, the DOJ informed the Court that it could not provide another response\n\nor production schedule because the DOJ\u2019s telework policies prevented access to a classified server\n\non which the responsive records were kept. ECF No. 19 \u00b6 4. These access restrictions continued\n\nuntil April 2022. See ECF Nos. 20 \u00b6 4; 38 \u00b6 3.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, the DOJ stated it had recently resumed processing Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest and had located approximately 600 potentially-responsive pages. ECF No. 38 \u00b6 4. The\n\nDOJ\u2019s processing involved coordination with other government agencies, including the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). ECF Nos. 38 \u00b6 5; 50-1 \u00b6 11; 51-3. On December 16, 2022, the\n\nFBI produced a redacted and previously-sealed declaration that the Government had filed in the\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ECF Nos. 50-1 at 7\u201324; 51-3.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, the DOJ issued its final response to part two of Eddington\u2019s FOIA\n\nrequest. ECF Nos. 41 \u00b6 5; 51-2. The DOJ informed Eddington that it had located seventy-two\n\npages of responsive records, all of which the DOJ withheld pursuant to various FOIA exemptions.\n\nECF No. 51-2. Eddington did not challenge any of the agency\u2019s withholdings or redactions. ECF\n\fNo. 50-1 \u00b6 14. On March 29, 2024, Eddington filed this Motion for an award of $18,980.15 in\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees and costs. ECF Nos. 50; 52.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to FOIA\u2019s fee recovery provision, a court may assess reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n\nand litigation costs against the United States in a case \u201cin which the complainant has substantially\n\nprevailed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i). The objectives of this provision are twofold: 1) to\n\nencourage FOIA litigation that benefits the public interest when private interest is lacking; and 2)\n\nto compensate plaintiffs for enduring an agency\u2019s unreasonable stonewalling in complying with\n\nFOIA\u2019s requirements. See Kwoka v. Internal Revenue Serv., 989 F.3d 1058, 1063 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\n\nEven if the Court deems the plaintiff a prevailing party under the FOIA statute, a fee award is not\n\nautomatic. See Morley v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 894 F.3d 389, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam)\n\n(noting that FOIA states that the Court \u201cmay\u201d award fees to a prevailing plaintiff, not that the\n\nCourt \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d). The Court retains broad discretion in deciding whether to award fees.\n\nSee Hall & Assocs. v. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 210 F. Supp. 3d 13, 19 (D.D.C. 2016) (citations\n\nomitted), aff\u2019d per curiam, No. 16-5315, 2018 WL 1896493 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 9, 2018)\n\n(unpublished).\n\nTo recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under FOIA, a plaintiff must be both eligible for and\n\nentitled to fees. Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. Cent. Intel. Agency, 811 F.3d 22, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2016). If a\n\nplaintiff is eligible and entitled, they may recover a fee award that is reasonable. Urb. Air\n\nInitiative, Inc. v. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 442 F. Supp. 3d 301, 310 (D.D.C. 2020) (citations omitted).\n\f I. Eddington Is Not Eligible to Recover Attorneys\u2019 Fees Because He Has Failed to\n Establish That He Substantially Prevailed in This Lawsuit.\n\nA. Legal Standard\n\nOne of the ways a plaintiff can show they substantially prevailed in the litigation is by\n\nestablishing that they obtained relief through \u201ca voluntary or unilateral change in position by the\n\nagency, if the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim [was] not insubstantial.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(ii). This is\n\nreferred to as the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d Grand Canyon Tr. v. Bernhardt, 947 F.3d 94, 95 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2020) (per curiam).\n\nUnder the catalyst theory, the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that, but\n\nfor the plaintiff filing suit, the agency would not have performed the desired act, such as producing\n\nrecords. Id. at 97 (citations omitted); see Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Harris, 653 F.2d 584,\n\n587 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting this is a question of causation). Courts look at the totality of the\n\ncircumstances to determine whether there is a causal nexus between a plaintiff filing suit and an\n\nagency\u2019s change in position. See Conservation Force v. Jewell, 160 F. Supp. 3d 194, 202 (D.D.C.\n\n2016) (citation omitted). If factors unrelated to the lawsuit trigger an agency\u2019s disclosure, the\n\nplaintiff has not demonstrated causation and is not a prevailing party under the catalyst theory.\n\nGrand Canyon Tr. v. Zinke, 311 F. Supp. 3d 381, 389 (D.D.C. 2018), aff\u2019d sub nom. Grand Canyon\n\nTr., 947 F.3d 94.\n\nAlthough timing may be relevant in this analysis, a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a complaint and an\n\nagency\u2019s subsequent disclosure is not enough to show causation. See Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d\n\nat 97; see also Pub. L. Educ. Inst. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 744 F.2d 181, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating\n\nsomething \u201cmore than post hoc, ergo propter hoc must be shown\u201d). There must be \u201chard evidence\u201d\n\nbeyond timing that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit caused the agency to release documents or provide other\n\nrequested relief. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, the Court may\n\fconsider whether the agency had a reasonable amount of time to respond to a FOIA request before\n\nthe plaintiff filed suit. See First Look Inst. Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Glob. Media, No. 20-cv-3499,\n\n2024 WL 3744818, at *4 (D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2024) (collecting cases), report and recommendation\n\nadopted sub nom. First Look Media Works, Inc. v.

Cir. July 2, 2025) (unpublished). The\n\nCourt also considers whether unavoidable external factors caused an agency\u2019s delay, including\n\ninadvertent administrative constraints. See Env\u2019t Integrity Project v. United States Env\u2019t Prot.\n\nAgency, 316 F. Supp. 3d 320, 328 (D.D.C. 2018).\n\nB. Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\nEddington makes a half-hearted argument that he is eligible for fees under the catalyst\n\ntheory.2 ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. His only meaningful argument is that the lawsuit caused\n\na \u201csudden acceleration\u201d of the DOJ\u2019s production. ECF No. 50 at 4. Under that theory, Eddington\n\npoints to two pieces of alleged \u201chard evidence.\u201d Id. at 5-6. He asserts that the DOJ \u201cimmediately\n\nbegan processing\u201d his request once he filed suit because the DOJ stated in the Parties\u2019 first JSR\n\nthat the agency was in the process of conducting searches. ECF Nos. 1; 50 at 5; see also ECF No.\n\n11 \u00b6 2. Relying on the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report,3 Eddington contrasts the nearly four-month\n\nperiod between his May 15, 2019 FOIA request and the Parties\u2019 first JSR, with the DOJ\u2019s average\n Indeed, he devoted only two paragraphs in his opening Motion to this argument.\n Each fiscal year, agencies must publicly report certain statistical information concerning\ntheir FOIA processes to the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Government\nInformation Services. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e). Courts in this District have relied on these reports\nin FOIA cases. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Sec. Couns. v. C.I.A., 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 259 n.14 (D.D.C. 2012),\naff\u2019d, 969 F.3d 406 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\n\fprocessing time in the NSD of over one year for \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests.4 ECF No. 50 at 5\u20136.\n\nEddington claims that the disparity between the average processing time and the time it took for\n\nthe DOJ to start processing his FOIA request shows that it is \u201clikely\u201d that the DOJ would not have\n\nprocessed his request as soon as it did absent this lawsuit. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135.\n\nEddington also asserts that the DOJ failed to provide evidence of its pre-suit processing steps.\n\nECF No. 52 at 4\u20135.\n\nThe DOJ argues that Eddington fails to provide any \u201cevidence that this suit caused [the\n\nDOJ] to change what it already was doing with respect to the FOIA request.\u201d ECF No. 51 at 8.\n\nThe DOJ first argues that it is not the case that the agency failed to communicate with Eddington\n\nprior to his lawsuit because the agency let him know it was processing the request. Id. at 7. The\n\nDOJ sent a letter on June 17, 2019, informing Eddington that it would process his request as\n\nquickly as possible consistent with the agency\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and the administrative\n\ndemands of the request. Id. at 7, 10\u201311; see also ECF No. 50-1 at 6. Second, the DOJ argues that\n\nthe DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report does not provide any conclusive evidence of a \u201csudden acceleration\u201d\n\nin this case. ECF No. 51 at 11\u201312. Among other things, the agency points out that the Report\n\nsimply provides averages from one fiscal year, which necessarily means that there were requests\n\nthat were processed in less time than the average. Id. at 11. The agency also points out that the\n\nReport fails to account for other \u201cunforeseen contingent events that may operate to quicken or slow\n\ndown the processing of a FOIA request.\u201d Id. The DOJ also notes that Eddington\u2019s argument\n\nhinges entirely on FOIA statistics from 2019 despite the DOJ not completing processing in this\n\ncase until January 2023. Id. at 12.\n See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., United States Department of Justice Annual Freedom of\nInformation Act Report: Fiscal Year 2019 34 (2019) (\u201c2019 FOIA Report\u201d),\nhttps://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1253751/dl?inline=.\n\f C. Discussion\n\nEddington has failed to establish that it is more probable than not that his lawsuit caused\n\nthe DOJ to change its pre-suit position on his FOIA request. Eddington asks the Court to find that\n\nhe has substantially prevailed in this lawsuit based solely on the proposition that the NSD\u2019s average\n\ntime in 2019 for fully processing a complex FOIA request was greater than the time it took for the\n\nagency to start processing Eddington\u2019s request. ECF Nos. 50 at 5\u20136; 52 at 2\u20135. Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that this alleged disparity establishes the DOJ \u201csuddenly accelerated\u201d processing\n\nbecause Eddington filed suit. ECF No. 50 at 4.\n\nCourts in this District have concluded that an agency\u2019s \u201csudden acceleration\u201d in processing\n\na FOIA request after a plaintiff files suit may show that the lawsuit caused the agency to change\n\nits position. Terris, Pravlik & Millian, LLP v. Cents. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., 794 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 29, 38 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Crooker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 663 F.2d 140 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1980)). This necessarily means that a plaintiff must first show that the agency initially took\n\nan adverse position on the FOIA request or engaged in an unexplained delay before the plaintiff\n\nfiled suit. See First Look Media Works, Inc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *4. A plaintiff must then\n\nprove that \u201cthe agency did in fact accelerate its response to the FOIA request because of the\n\nlawsuit.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Eddington does not make either showing.\n\nEddington fails to show that the DOJ initially took an adverse position on his FOIA request\n\nor engaged in a significant and unexplained pre-suit delay. See Am. Wild Horse Campaign v. U.S.\n\nBureau of Land Mgmt., No. 22-cv-3061, 2024 WL 3967256, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 26, 2024) (noting\n\nthat an agency\u2019s significant delay can support an inference that the agency forgot about or ignored\n\nthe request). Although the DOJ does not provide a declaration explaining its pre-suit processing,\n\nEddington\u2019s own evidence shows that the agency was aware of his FOIA request. ECF No. 50-1\n\fat 6. The agency sent Eddington a response within thirty-three days of his FOIA request. Id. \u00b6 10.\n\nIn that pre-suit letter, the agency informed Eddington that it would process his request as quickly\n\nas possible in line with the DOJ\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d policy and other administrative demands. Id.\n\nat 6; see Grand Canyon Tr., 311 F. Supp. 3d at 390 (holding that plaintiff was not eligible for fees\n\ndespite the agency\u2019s failure to produce a declaration). Accordingly, this is not a case in which the\n\nagency ignored the FOIA request, took an adverse pre-suit position, or delayed significantly in\n\ngetting back to Eddington.\n\nMoreover, Eddington filed suit only fifty-eight days after making his FOIA request and\n\nonly twenty-five days after the agency first responded to him. ECF No. 50-1 at \u00b6 10. This further\n\nundermines the argument that there was some supposed pre-suit delay. First Look Media Works,\n\nInc., 2024 WL 4262773, at *5; Am. Wild Horse Campaign, 2024 WL 3967256, at *1, *3 (finding\n\nthe plaintiff was not eligible for fees despite the agency failing to communicate pre-suit with the\n\nplaintiff for eight months after confirming receipt). Eddington cannot manufacture a \u201csudden\n\nacceleration\u201d simply by rushing to file suit and then claiming that the lawsuit caused the DOJ to\n\nsubsequently process and release documents. The timing of Eddington\u2019s lawsuit means that the\n\nagency would in any circumstance be producing documents after the suit was filed. Gov\u2019t\n\nAccountability & Oversight v. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, No. 23-cv-3268, 2024 WL 4828107, at *5\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 19, 2024). Eddington has failed to show that the DOJ was doing anything but\n\nproceeding business as usual on his FOIA request before he filed suit. Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe\n\nof Indians v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 750 F.2d 117, 120 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\u201cAbsent any evidence on\n\nthe matter, the natural inference is that the [defendant] was simply responding to the [plaintiff\u2019s]\n\nrequest.\u201d).\n\f Eddington also fails to show that the DOJ suddenly accelerated processing his FOIA\n\nrequest because of his lawsuit. In determining whether an agency would have taken longer to\n\nproduce responsive records absent a lawsuit, the Court may compare the agency\u2019s processing time\n\nfor a specific FOIA request against the agency\u2019s average processing time for similar requests. See,\n\ne.g., Gov\u2019t Accountability & Oversight, 2024 WL 4828107, at *4. Eddington errs, however, in\n\nattempting to make an apples-to-apples comparison between his case and the average processing\n\ntime for 2019 \u201ccomplex\u201d FOIA requests. First, Eddington merely assumes without any support\n\nthat his case qualifies as \u201ccomplex\u201d as the agency defined that term for inclusion of cases in the\n\n2019 report.5 See 2019 FOIA Report at 34 (recording that the NSD had an average processing\n\ntime of approximately 110 days for simple FOIA request versus an average of approximately 418\n\ndays for complex FOIA requests). Second, Eddington does not account for the fact that, even if\n\nhis case did qualify as \u201ccomplex,\u201d the report still presents only an average number, necessarily\n\nmeaning that there were complex cases which were processed faster than the average.\n\nThird, the DOJ\u2019s 2019 FOIA Report captures the average time the DOJ took to complete\n\nprocessing for a FOIA request, not the time it took to initiate processing. See id. at 5 (defining a\n\nprocessed FOIA request as \u201ca request . . . for which an agency has taken final action in all\n\nrespects\u201d). As Eddington acknowledges, the DOJ did not complete processing for his FOIA\n\nrequest until January 11, 2023, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. ECF Nos. 41; 50 at 5 n.2; 51-\n\n2. The DOJ, therefore, took approximately 1,337 days to process Eddington\u2019s FOIA request.\n\nEddington does not offer any explanation to account for the fact that this 1,377-day processing\n\ntime was actually longer than the 418-day average upon which he relies. Finally, Eddington does\n In the 2019 FOIA Report, the DOJ defines a complex request as \u201ca FOIA request that an\nagency using multi-track processing places in a slower track based on the high volume and/or\ncomplexity of the records requested.\u201d See 2019 FOIA Report at 5.\n\fnot provide any evidence that, absent the Covid-19 pandemic, the DOJ would have completed\n\nprocessing his request much faster than this 418-day average. See Harrington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\n\nHealth & Hum. Servs., No. 20-cv-2671, 2022 WL 17555428, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 9, 2022)\n\n(concluding the plaintiff was ineligible for fees despite the agency completing processing \u201ca few\n\nmonths faster\u201d than the agency\u2019s estimated completion date).\n\nIn sum, Eddington has not shown that the DOJ initially engaged in an unexplained delay\n\nbefore he filed suit or that his lawsuit caused the DOJ to suddenly accelerate processing for his\n\nFOIA request. Eddington does not provide hard evidence that he substantially prevailed in this\n\nlitigation beyond the fact that the DOJ processed his FOIA request and produced documents after\n\nhe filed suit. Conservation Force, 160 F. Supp. 3d at 206. Accordingly, Eddington is not eligible\n\nfor attorneys\u2019 fees. Grand Canyon Tr., 947 F.3d at 97 (citations omitted). Because Eddington has\n\nfailed to show that he is eligible for fees, the Court need not consider whether he is entitled to fees\n\nor if his requested award is reasonable.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends Eddington\u2019s Motion be DENIED.\n\nDate: July 23, 2025\n\n___________________________________\n MOXILA A.

Part One of request\n\nsought records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the total number of labor hours worked during that period,\n\nand Part Two demanded records \u201csufficient to establish\u201d the hours devoted \u201cto investigations of\n\nany and all matters related to left wing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist\n\nagendas-anarchists like Antifa and other agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Def.\u2019s\n\nMot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 13 [hereinafter Def.\u2019s Mot.], Decl. of Michael G. Seidel, ECF No.\n\n13-1 [hereinafter Seidel Decl.], \u00b6 5, Ex. A. The FBI produced a one-page record in response to the\n\nfirst part of the request, but as to the second advised Plaintiff:\n\nThe FOIA does not require federal agencies to answer inquiries,\n create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions concerning\n queried data. Rather the FOIA requires agencies to provide access\n to reasonably described, nonexempt records. The questions posed\n\f in the referenced letter are not FOIA requests because they do not\n comply with the FOIA and its regulations. Therefore, your request\n is being administratively closed.\n\nId., Ex. F.\n\nDefendant moves for summary judgment. See Def.\u2019s Mot. Plaintiffs do not contest the\n\nagency\u2019s response to Part One of the request. Mem. in Support of Pls.\u2019 Mot. in Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s\n\nMot., ECF No. 19 [hereinafter Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n], at 2 n.1. Their dispute concerns Part Two. At issue is\n\nwhether Plaintiffs properly exhausted administrative remedies as to that portion of the demand,\n\nand whether Defendant conducted an adequate search for records. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 8\u201310; Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n\n\nat 9\u201311.\n\nThe court finds that Defendant performed an adequate search with respect to Part Two of\n\nthe request. It therefore does not reach the exhaustion issue. See Hidalgo v. FBI, 344 F.3d 1256,\n\n1258 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (stating that \u201cthe exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional because the\n\nFOIA does not unequivocally make it so\u201d). Accordingly, the court will enter judgment in favor of\n\nDefendant.\n\nII.\n\nTo demonstrate it conducted an adequate search, an \u201cagency must show that it made a good\n\nfaith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably\n\nexpected to produce the information requested.\u201d Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 920 F.2d 57,\n\n68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The agency must provide a \u201creasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the\n\nsearch terms and the type of search performed, and averring that all files likely to contain\n\nresponsive materials (if such records exist) were searched.\u201d Id. An agency affidavit is accorded a\n\npresumption of good faith if it is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory, and . . . submitted in\n\ngood faith.\u201d Eddington v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 35 F.4th 833, 837 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting\n\fSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). That presumption cannot be\n\novercome with \u201cpurely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of [the request].\u201d\n\nId. (quoting SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200) (alteration in original). The plaintiff must provide\n\n\u201c\u2018countervailing evidence\u2019 as to the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\u201d Iturralde v. Comptroller of\n\nthe Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citation omitted). \u201cIf a review of the\n\nrecord raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of well defined requests and positive\n\nindications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is inappropriate.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nIn this case, Defendant\u2019s declaration from Michael Seidel is entitled to a presumption of\n\ngood faith. It is \u201crelatively detailed and non-conclusory\u201d and explains why the FBI produced no\n\nrecords in response to Part Two of the request. See Eddington, 35 F.4th at 837; Seidel Decl.,\n\nSeidel is the Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section of the FBI.\n\nSeidel Decl. \u00b6 1. He states that, to identify responsive information, the agency turned to the\n\nPerformance Management Unit (PMU), Resources Planning Office, in the Office of the Associate\n\nDeputy Director. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 23. Seidel explains:\n\nPMU is responsible for organizing and making management data\n accessible to the FBI to impact decisions on program management,\n resource allocation and organizational planning. PMU structures\n and arranges information related to various aspects of the FBI\n operations and resources, and ensures that crucial data is readily\n available and easily retrievable when needed.\n\nId. PMU advised that its ability to report validated hours for specific cases assigned to the\n\nWashington Field Office was \u201climited.\u201d Id. \u00b6 26. FBI agents record hours worked on cases and\n\nassociate certain classification codes, but \u201cthere is no tracking mechanism for distinguishing cases\n\nrelated to specific events.\u201d Id. There is no classification code associated with matters such as \u201cleft\n\nwing domestic terrorism . . . includ[ing] \u2018violent, extremist agendas-anarchists like Antifa and\n\nother agitators\u2019 arising from the summer 2020 riots.\u201d Id. To fulfill Part Two of the request, the\n\fFBI \u201cwould be required to answer inquiries, create records, conduct research, or draw conclusions\n\nconcerning queried data which are not required under FOIA.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27. The FBI \u201cdoes not\n\nmaintain the specific data sought by Plaintiffs\u201d in Part Two of their request. Id. \u00b6 32.\n\nPlaintiffs submit two critiques of the search. First, grasping on to the word \u201climited,\u201d which\n\nPMU used to describe its capacity to retrieve labor hours data about specific events, Plaintiffs\n\nassert that the declaration lacks sufficient specificity to establish that responsive data does not\n\nexist. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10. But that contention overlooks Seidel\u2019s explanation that \u201cto fulfill\n\nPlaintiffs[\u2019] request\u201d the agency would have to sift through the available data, analyze it, drawn\n\ninferences from it, and create a new record. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 27. The declaration leaves no room for\n\ndoubt that data responsive to Part Two does not independently exist.\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs fault the agency for not inquiring into whether the data sought \u201cmay have\n\nalready been compiled\u201d in some other form. Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. As Plaintiffs put it: \u201c[T]he FBI\n\nappears to only have searched for source data to produce \u2018records sufficient to show\u2019; it appears\n\nthey did not search for compilations of that data that answer the same question.\u201d Id. at 11.\n\nBut Plaintiffs offer no \u201ccountervailing evidence\u201d to believe that such a compilation exists. They\n\ndo not assert that the FBI \u201cfailed to search particular offices or files where the document might\n\nwell have been found.\u201d Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315. They do not contend that the agency \u201cfailed\n\nor refused to interview government officials for whom there was strong evidence that they might\n\nhave been helpful in finding the missing documents.\u201d Id. And Plaintiffs point to no \u201cevidence\n\nthat would indicate that at the time the Department searched its files there was reason to believe\u201d\n\nthat a responsive compilation of data was contained in the files. Id.; see Eddington, 35 F.4th at\n\n838 (describing Iturralde as \u201clisting ways government affidavit or declaration could be\n\ninadequate\u201d).\n\f In the end, Plaintiffs merely speculate that a report or some other record exists that contains\n\nthe highly specific information that they seek: verified labor hours spent by (1) a particular FBI\n\nfield office (2) during a defined three-month period (3) on investigations into left-wing domestic\n\nterrorist groups like Antifa and \u201cother agitators\u201d that (4) arose out of \u201cthe summer 2020 riots.\u201d\n\nSee Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10\u201311. Plaintiffs\u2019 supposition that such a data compilation might exist is not\n\nenough to raise substantial doubt about the adequacy of the agency\u2019s search.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court grants Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nECF No. 13. A final, appealable order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nDated: July 23, 2025 Amit P. Mehta\n United States District Judge\n\n5"

For the following reasons, we grant Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s writ application for the limited purpose of ordering the trial court to\n\nconsider Ms. Toussaint\u2019s \u201cNotice of Intent to File Supervisory Writ (\u201cNotice of\n\nIntent\u201d) as a timely motion for appeal.\n\nRELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL\n HISTORY\n\nOn October 3, 2022, Nichele1 Spears died during a colonoscopy screening.\n\nOn June 1, 2023, her husband, Sean Toussaint, filed a request for the appointment\n\nof a medical review panel. The medical review panel rendered an opinion on July\n\n18, 2024, therein finding that a nurse and doctor breached the applicable standard\n\nof care during Nichele Spears\u2019 procedure. Shortly thereafter, on September 3,\n\n2024, Sean Toussaint also died. On October 15, 2024, the Orleans Parish Civil\n\nDistrict Court appointed Ms. Toussaint, the sister of Sean Toussaint, as the\n\nadministratrix of his succession. Only one week later, on October 22, 2024, Rhyan\n\n1 The name \u201cNicole\u201d also appears in Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application; but this Opinion\n\nwill use the name \u201cNichele\u201d because that is the name listed in the medical review panel opinion\nand the Petition for Damages, both of which are discussed later.\n\fSpears, who is the son of Nichele Spears, filed a Petition for Damages in Orleans\n\nParish Civil District Court against the nurse and doctor regarding his mother\u2019s\n\ndeath.\n\nSubsequently, on April 15, 2025, Ms. Toussaint filed her Motion to\n\nIntervene, whereby she contended she had an interest in intervening in Rhyan\n\nSpears\u2019 lawsuit pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091 because she had been appointed\n\nadministratix of Sean Toussaint\u2019s succession; was a surviving heir of Sean\n\nToussaint; and sought the same or similar relief as Rhyan Spears.2 As Ms.\n\nToussaint explained in her Motion to Intervene, prior to his death, Sean Toussaint\n\nhad initiated a wrongful death and survival action against the defendants named in\n\nRhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit. Ms. Toussaint asserted that as the administratrix of Sean\n\nToussaint\u2019s estate, she therefore had \u201cthe right and responsibility to sue on behalf\n\nof [the] estate to recover assets owed to it, defend against claims, and ensure the\n\nestate interests [were] protected in the succession process\u201d pursuant to La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 3196.3 Rhyan Spears, the defendant nurse, and the State of Louisiana on behalf\n\nof the defendant doctor each filed an opposition to Ms. Toussaint\u2019s Motion to\n\nIntervene and asked the trial court to dismiss it.\n\nOn June 12, 2025, the trial court conducted a hearing on Ms. Toussaint\u2019s\n\nMotion to Intervene. In a judgment dated June 17, 2025, the trial court denied Ms.\n\nToussaint\u2019s Motion to Intervene and dismissed it with prejudice. On July 7, 2025,\n\nMs. Toussaint filed her Notice of Intent. Therein, she specified that she was\n\n2 Regarding the ability to intervene, La. C.C.P. art. 1091 states that \u201c[a] third person\n\nhaving an interest therein may intervene in a pending action to enforce a right related to or\nconnected with the object of the pending action against one or more of the parties thereto.\u201d\nAccording to La. C.C.P. art. 1031, an intervention is an incidental demand.\n 3 Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 3196 provides that \u201cIn the performance of\n\nhis [or her] duties, a succession representative may exercise all procedural rights available to a\nlitigant.\u201d\n\fseeking review of the June 17, 2025 judgment and requested that the trial court\n\nstay the proceedings in Rhyan Spears\u2019 lawsuit pending this Court\u2019s decision. On\n\nJuly 9, 2025, the trial court signed the order permitting Ms. Toussaint to seek\n\nsupervisory review but denied Ms. Toussaint\u2019s request for a stay of the\n\nproceedings. This Court received Ms. Toussaint\u2019s timely writ application on July\n\n16, 2025.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\nIn her writ application, Ms. Toussaint asserts two assignments of error:\n\n1. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that filing of a\n request for a Medical Review Panel under La. R.S. 40:1231.8\n does not constitute the legal initiation of a medical malpractice\n claim.\n\n2. [Ms. Toussaint] alleges that the [t]rial [c]ourt erred and\n committed reversible error when it deemed that an appointed\n administrator of a deceased claimant\u2019s estate did not have legal\n authority to continue a pending medical malpractice action\n initially filed by the decedent.\n\nIn our review of Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application, we realized a procedural issue\n\nthat must be addressed before this Court can consider the merits of these above\n\narguments.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIssue One: Whether a Writ Application was the Proper Procedural Vehicle for\nSeeking Review of the Trial Court\u2019s Judgment\n\nBy filing a writ application regarding the trial court\u2019s June 17, 2025\n\njudgment dismissing her Motion to Intervene, Ms. Toussaint sought to invoke this\n\nCourt\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction rather than our appellate jurisdiction. This Court\n\n\u201chas appellate jurisdiction of . . . all civil matters\u201d and \u201chas supervisory jurisdiction\n\nover cases which arise within its circuit.\u201d La. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 10. \u201cThis [C]ourt\u2019s\n\fappellate jurisdiction extends to final judgments identified as such by appropriate\n\nlanguage and to interlocutory judgments when expressly provided by law.\u201d First\n\nNBC Bank v. River Park Dev., L.L.C., 2021-1209, p. 3 (La. App. 1 Cir. 4/8/22),\n\n341 So.3d 827, 829 (first citing La. C.C.P. arts. 1918 and 2083; and then citing\n\nBarfield v. Tammany Holding Co., 2016-1420 (La. App. 1 Cir. 6/2/17), 2017 WL\n\n2399020, *1). We begin our discussion with the question of whether a writ\n\napplication\u2014rather than an appeal\u2014was the proper procedural vehicle for Ms.\n\nToussaint to seek review of the judgment. To resolve this issue, we must determine\n\nif the trial court\u2019s judgment was appealable. If so, an appeal was the proper method\n\nfor seeking review instead of a writ application.\n\nWe find the relevant codal articles and jurisprudence interpreting them\n\nsupport a finding that a judgment dismissing a request to intervene is an appealable\n\njudgment. Defining the types of judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1841 states that a final\n\njudgment is one \u201cthat determines the merits in whole or in part.\u201d According to La.\n\nC.C.P. art. 2083, \u201c[a] final judgment is appealable in all causes in which appeals\n\nare given by law, whether rendered after hearing, by default, or by reformation\n\nunder [La. C.C.P. art.] 1814.\u201d Regarding final judgments, La. C.C.P. art. 1915\n\nspecifies that a final judgment can be a partial one. That is,\n\nA. A final judgment may be rendered and signed by the court,\n even though it may not grant the successful party or parties all of the\n relief prayed for, or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case,\n when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to less than all of the parties,\n defendants, third party plaintiffs, third party defendants, or\n intervenors.\n\nLa. C.C.P. art. 1915 (A)(1). In interpreting La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) in Simmons\n\nv. Chambliss, the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal (\u201cSecond Circuit\u201d)\n\freviewed the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining exceptions of no right of action and\n\nno cause of action and dismissing the claims in intervention asserted by Anthony J.\n\nBruscato (\u201cMr. Bruscato\u201d). 37,461, p. 2 (La. App. 2 Cir. 8/20/03), 852 So.2d 1237,\n\n1238. Prior to considering the merits of the appeal, the Second Circuit ruled the\n\nappeal could proceed because the judgment was a final judgment as to Mr.\n\nBruscato under La. C.C.P. art. 1915(A)(1) since he had been dismissed from the\n\naction and was no longer a party thereto. Id. at p. 2, 852 So.2d at 1239.\n\nAdditionally, in Servi-Clean Industries, Inc. v. Tonti Management Corp., the\n\nLouisiana Supreme Court explained that a judgment dismissing an intervention is a\n\n\u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the contemplation of La. C.C.P. art. 1841 as it is a\n\ndetermination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding. 336 So.2d 799,\n\n805 (La. 1976).\n\nMoreover, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal has specifically held\n\nthat when a trial court denies a petition to intervene, this constitutes an appealable\n\njudgment. First NBC Bank, 2021-1209, p. 3, 341 So.3d at 829 (citations omitted).\n\nFurther, this Court has reviewed a trial court\u2019s judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene under its appellate jurisdiction. See generally Roy Anderson Corp. v. 225\n\nBaronne Complex, L.L.C., 2022-0784 (La. App. 4 Cir. 4/11/23), 360 So.3d 144;\n\nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 455 So.2d 1260 (La. App.\n\n4th Cir. 1984). In light of the foregoing, we find a judgment denying a request to\n\nintervene is an appealable judgment. Thus, an appeal was the proper method for\n\nMs. Toussaint to seek review of the trial court\u2019s judgment denying her Motion to\n\nIntervene, not an application for supervisory writ.\n\fIssue Two: How to Proceed with a Writ Application Seeking Review of an\nAppealable Judgment\n\nNext, we must consider how to proceed in light of our above holding that the\n\ntrial court\u2019s judgment was an appealable judgment for which Ms. Toussaint should\n\nhave filed an appeal rather than a writ application. In In re Howard, the Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court considered a plaintiff\u2019s filing of a writ application with the\n\nLouisiana Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal rather than an appeal regarding the\n\nunderlying appealable judgment. 541 So.2d 195 (La. 1989). The Louisiana\n\nSupreme Court explained the plaintiff made a mistake by seeking review of the\n\njudgment by supervisory writs rather than appeal. Id., 541 So.2d at 197. Noting,\n\nhowever, that the plaintiff filed her motion and order with the trial court within the\n\ndelay for taking a devolutive appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the\n\nmatter to the trial court with instructions to treat the plaintiff\u2019s notice of intent as a\n\nmotion for appeal and to grant the plaintiff an appeal from the judgment. Id.\n\nLike the plaintiff in In re Howard, Ms. Toussaint made a mistake when she\n\nsought review of the June 17, 2025 judgment by supervisory writs rather than by\n\nappeal because the judgment was appealable. Nevertheless, Ms. Toussaint filed her\n\nNotice of Intent and associated order well within the delays for taking an appeal.\n\nLa. C.C.P. arts. 2087, 2121, 2123. Accordingly, and because \u201c[e]very pleading\n\nshall be so construed as to do substantial justice,\u201d we find the same approach\n\nutilized by the Louisiana Supreme Court in In re Howard is proper here. La. C.C.P.\n\nart. 865. Though Ms. Toussaint erroneously titled her pleading \u201cNotice of Intent to\n\nFile Supervisory Writ,\u201d the trial court should have disregarded the erroneous title,\n\ntreated the pleading as a timely motion for appeal, and granted the appropriate\n\norder. In the interest of justice, and because Ms. Toussaint was entitled to an\n\fappeal of the June 17, 2025 final judgment upon the timely filing of a pleading\n\nseeking review of that judgment, we remand the matter to the trial court to treat\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s July 7, 2025 pleading seeking review of the June 17, 2025\n\njudgment as a timely motion for appeal. In light of this, we pretermit discussion of\n\nMs. Toussaint\u2019s assignments of error.\n\nDECREE\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we grant Ms. Toussaint\u2019s writ application for the\n\nlimited purpose of remanding this matter to the trial court with instructions to grant\n\nMs. Toussaint an appeal from the June 17, 2025 judgment.\n\nWRIT GRANTED; REMANDED\n\n7"

FISCHER, J., concurred in\njudgment only.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nPer Curiam.\n {\u00b6 1} This is an election case concerning respondent Franklin County Board\nof Elections\u2019 certification of respondent Holly Stein\u2019s name for placement on the\nNovember 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a candidate for the Ward 4 seat on the\nWhitehall City Council. Relators, Lori Elmore and the City of Whitehall, contend\nthat the board erred in certifying Stein\u2019s name because, they say, she does not meet\nthe two-year residency requirement found in Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\nAs relief, relators request a writ of prohibition to prevent the board from placing\nStein\u2019s name on the ballot. We grant the writ.\n I. BACKGROUND\n {\u00b6 2} Whitehall is a municipal corporation located within Franklin County\nand is governed by a charter. Section 3(a) of the charter provides that \u201cCouncil\nmembers for wards shall have resided in their respective wards and Council\nmembers at large shall have resided in the City for at least two years next preceding\ntheir election.\u201d Whitehall Charter, \u00a7 3(a).\n {\u00b6 3} In January 2025, Stein filed with the board a declaration of candidacy\nand a petition seeking nomination to represent Ward 4 on the Whitehall City\nCouncil. The board later certified Stein\u2019s name for placement on the November 4,\n2025 general-election ballot. Elmore currently serves as an at-large member of the\nWhitehall City Council and is a qualified Whitehall elector.\n {\u00b6 4} In February 2025, Elmore filed a protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy,\nand the board held a hearing on Elmore\u2019s protest in March. At the hearing, Elmore\ncontended that the board should disqualify Stein from the ballot because she did\nnot meet Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year residency requirement. Elmore interpreted\nSection 3(a) as requiring ward candidates to have lived in their respective wards for\nthe two years prior to the election at issue, meaning that for purposes of the\nNovember 4, 2025 general election, Stein must have lived in Ward 4 since\nNovember 4, 2023. In support of her claim that Stein did not meet this requirement,\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nElmore pointed to, among other things, Stein\u2019s voting records. Elmore deduced\nfrom these records that Stein resided in Licking County\u2014and thus outside Ward 4\nand Whitehall\u2014throughout 2023.\n {\u00b6 5} Stein appeared at the protest hearing, admitted that she lived in\nLicking County throughout 2023, and argued that she should nonetheless remain a\nWard 4 candidate for the Whitehall City Council. Stein maintained that under this\ncourt\u2019s decision in State ex rel. Rocco v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2017-\nOhio-4466, the Whitehall Charter required only that she have resided in Ward 4 for\nany two-year period preceding the election. Because she lived in Ward 4 from 2019\nuntil 2022, she asserted, her candidacy complied with Section 3(a)\u2019s two-year\nresidency requirement. Alternatively, based on principles of grammar, she argued\nthat the requirement applied only to at-large candidates and that ward candidates\nneed only show that they resided in their ward at any preceding time. Stein argued\nthat because she resided in her ward before the November 4, 2025 general election,\nher candidacy complied with Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n {\u00b6 6} At the conclusion of the hearing, the board denied Elmore\u2019s protest.\n {\u00b6 7} Relators then filed this original action seeking a writ of prohibition to\nprevent the board from placing Stein\u2019s name on the ballot or, alternatively, a writ\nof mandamus ordering the board to grant Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s\ncandidacy. We denied relators\u2019 motion to expedite the case. 2025-Ohio-1090.\nAfter respondents each filed a motion to dismiss the action, we granted the motions\nas to relators\u2019 mandamus claim, denied the motions as to the prohibition claim, sua\nsponte ordered respondents to answer the complaint as to the prohibition claim, and\nsua sponte granted an alternative writ of prohibition, scheduling the submission of\nevidence and briefs. 2025-Ohio-1757.\n {\u00b6 8} The case is ripe for our decision on relators\u2019 prohibition claim.\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n {\u00b6 9} To be entitled to a writ of prohibition, relators must show that (1) the\nboard has exercised quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power was\nunauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ would result in injury for which no\nadequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of the law. State ex rel. Elder v.\nCamplese, 2015-Ohio-3628, \u00b6 13. This court has observed that after a board of\nelections exercises its quasi-judicial power by denying a protest, relief in\nprohibition is available to prevent the placement of a name or issue on a ballot\nprovided that the election has not yet been held. See, e.g., Tatman v. Fairfield Cty.\nBd. of Elections, 2004-Ohio-3701, \u00b6 14.\n {\u00b6 10} There is no dispute that the board exercised quasi-judicial power by\ndenying Elmore\u2019s protest against Stein\u2019s candidacy. Nor is there a dispute that\nrelators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law due to the\nproximity of the November 4 election. Still more, the parties do not dispute the\nrelevant facts. What remains to be decided, then, is a purely legal question\nconcerning the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter.\n A. Rocco\u2019s dueling opinions and the meaning of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\n {\u00b6 11} Relators argue that under Section 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter, a\nward candidate for city council must have lived in her respective ward for at least\nthe two years immediately before the election at issue. Because Stein indisputably\ndid not live in Ward 4 during any part of 2023, they maintain, she should not have\nbeen certified for placement on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot as a\nWard 4 candidate.\n {\u00b6 12} Relators insist that their understanding of Section 3(a) is borne out\nby its plain meaning, thereby obviating the need for interpretation. They correctly\nobserve that when this court construes a city charter, general rules of statutory\ninterpretation apply. See State ex rel. Miller v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections,\n2021-Ohio-831, \u00b6 33. Thus, because the Whitehall Charter conveys an\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nunambiguous meaning, the argument runs, the charter must be applied rather than\ninterpreted. See Pelletier v. Campbell, 2018-Ohio-2121, \u00b6 14. But although\nrelators start their argument with an appeal to plain meaning, they immediately\npivot to parsing Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d against the\nbackdrop of how that phrase was understood by members of this court in Rocco,\n2017-Ohio-4466. In relators\u2019 view, Justice DeWine\u2019s dissenting opinion in that\ncase advanced the correct understanding of the phrase\u2014i.e., that \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as being synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\n {\u00b6 13} For their part, respondents urge us to follow the lead opinion in\nRocco, under which the phrases \u201cnext preceding\u201d and \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d\nshould be understood as having different meanings. Under respondents\u2019 view of\nSection 3(a), Stein need only have lived in Ward 4 for any two-year period\npreceding the upcoming election, not the period immediately preceding the\nelection. Respondents emphasize that under Section 23(a) of the Whitehall Charter,\nmayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City for three years\nimmediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they seek election.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Respondents maintain that had the charter\u2019s drafters intended\nfor Section 3(a) to mean what relators say it means, then the drafters would have\nused the same language for ward candidates that they used for mayoral candidates.\n {\u00b6 14} Because Rocco looms large in this case, we begin our analysis by\ndiscussing that case. At issue there was whether Andrea Rocco should appear on\nthe ballot as a candidate for the City of Westlake\u2019s law director. The Westlake\nCharter provided that\n\n\u201c[t]he Director of Law shall be a qualified elector at the time of his\n election, shall have been a resident of the City for at least eighteen\n (18) months immediately preceding his election, an attorney at law\n duly admitted to the practice of law before the courts of the State of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nOhio, and been engaged in the active practice of law in Ohio for a\n period of six (6) years next preceding his election.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Rocco at \u00b6 8 (lead opinion), quoting Westlake Charter,\nart. IV, \u00a7 4.\n {\u00b6 15} Multiple protests were brought against Rocco\u2019s candidacy, arguing\nthat because she had not practiced law for the six years immediately preceding the\nupcoming election, her candidacy was defective. The Cuyahoga County Board of\nElections sustained the protests, and Rocco then brought an original action in this\ncourt, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the board to place her name on the\nballot.\n {\u00b6 16} Four separate opinions resulted. Although a majority of the court\nvoted to grant the writ, the majority could not agree on a rationale. The lead\nopinion, authored by former Justice O\u2019Donnell and joined by former Justice French,\ndetermined that the Westlake Charter required only that candidates for law director\nhave been engaged in the active practice of law for any period of six years preceding\nthe election at issue. Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 2. Former Justice O\u2019Neill concurred\nin judgment only and authored an opinion addressing a separate issue that has no\nbearing on this case. See id. at \u00b6 23-24 (O\u2019Neill, J., concurring in judgment only).\nJustice Fischer concurred in judgment only without an opinion. Former Chief\nJustice O\u2019Connor dissented, opining that the charter required law-director\ncandidates to have been engaged in the active practice of law during the six-year\nperiod immediately preceding the election. Id. at \u00b6 35 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting).\nAnd Justice DeWine authored a dissent joined by then-Justice Kennedy, expressing\na view similar to the one advanced by former Chief Justice O\u2019Connor. See id. at\n\u00b6 52 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 17} In support of the court\u2019s judgment granting the writ, the lead opinion\nexplained that whereas the Westlake Charter uses the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d in\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nprescribing the practice-of-law requirement, it uses the phrase \u201cimmediately\npreceding\u201d in prescribing the residency requirement. Reasoning that the difference\nin wording must have been meant to convey a difference in meaning, the lead\nopinion inferred that the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d meant something different from\nthe phrase \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d especially because the two phrases appeared\nin \u201cclose proximity\u201d to each other. Id. at \u00b6 16. As the lead opinion put it, had the\ncharter\u2019s drafters intended to require candidates to have been engaged in the active\npractice of law during the six-year period immediately preceding the election at\nissue, they would have used wording to that effect, \u201c[b]ut they did not do so.\u201d Id.\nThe lead opinion also emphasized that under the charter, candidates had to have\npracticed law for \u201ca period of six (6) years\u201d rather than \u201cthe period of six (6) years.\u201d\n(Emphasis added in Rocco.) Id. at \u00b6 13, quoting Westlake Charter, art. IV, \u00a7 4.\nBecause \u201ca\u201d is an indefinite article conveying the sense of \u201cany,\u201d the lead opinion\nreasoned, the charter required only that candidates have been engaged in the\npractice of law for any six-year period preceding the election. See id. Last, the\nlead opinion invoked the policy principle that doubts should be resolved in favor of\nthose seeking office to enable the public to have the benefit of choice among all\nqualified persons. Id. at \u00b6 18.\n {\u00b6 18} The dissenters countered that the lead opinion\u2019s approach sapped the\nphrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d of its ordinary meaning. They pointed out that under\nseveral lexical sources, there was no linguistic daylight between \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38\n(DeWine, J., dissenting). As discussed below, they also observed that the Revised\nCode contains numerous instances in which it makes sense to construe \u201cnext\npreceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30-32\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 39-40 (DeWine, J., dissenting). And they also\nsaw a sensible policy reflected in their construction of the charter\u2014namely, that the\nvoters would be better served by a candidate currently engaged in the practice of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nlaw than by one whose practice had lain dormant. Id. at \u00b6 33 (O\u2019Connor, C.J.,\ndissenting); id. at \u00b6 51 (DeWine, J., dissenting).\n {\u00b6 19} The above discussion of Rocco raises the question whether we\nshould follow the lead opinion\u2019s analysis or the dissenters\u2019.1 A plurality opinion\ndoes not constitute binding authority, but a court may rely on a plurality opinion if\nit finds the opinion to be persuasive. NASCAR Holdings, Inc. v. Testa, 2017-Ohio-\n9118, \u00b6 18. For the reasons explained below, we decline to follow the Rocco lead\nopinion here.\n {\u00b6 20} As noted above, general rules of statutory interpretation apply in\ndiscerning the meaning of a city charter. Miller, 2021-Ohio-831, at \u00b6 33. Foremost\namong these rules is that \u201c\u2018[t]he words of a governing text are of paramount\nconcern, and what they convey, in their context, is what the text means.\u2019 \u201d State v.\nReed, 2020-Ohio-4255, \u00b6 17, quoting Scalia and Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts, 56 (2012). In the absence of a legislative definition\nor technical meaning, it is proper to use dictionaries to discern a word\u2019s plain and\nordinary meaning. See Rancho Cincinnati Rivers, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of\nRevision, 2021-Ohio-2798, \u00b6 21; see also Athens v. McClain, 2020-Ohio-5146, \u00b6 30\n(\u201cIn determining the \u2018common and ordinary meaning\u2019 of words, courts may look to\ndictionaries.\u201d); State v. Wells, 2001-Ohio-3, \u00b6 8 (\u201cTo determine the common,\neveryday meaning of a word, we have consistently used dictionary definitions.\u201d).\n {\u00b6 21} The lead opinion in Rocco strayed from these principles. As the\ndissenters noted, the lead opinion did not even try to discover the plain and ordinary\nmeaning of the words \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d Rocco, 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 27\n(O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 43 (DeWine, J., dissenting). Rather, the lead\nopinion inferred that because the Westlake Charter used the phrases \u201cimmediately\n\n1. Although the Rocco lead opinion was followed in State ex rel. Nasal v. Miami Cty. Bd. of\nElections, 2021-Ohio-2993, \u00b6 10, and State ex rel. Emhoff v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2018-\nOhio-1660, \u00b6 20, Nasal was a plurality decision and Emhoff relied on Rocco\u2019s practice-of-law\nanalysis, which is not an issue in this case.\n\f January Term, 2025\n\npreceding\u201d and \u201cnext preceding\u201d in close proximity to each other, the phrases must\nhave different meanings. Before drawing this inference, however, the lead opinion\nshould have first consulted proper lexical sources to determine the meaning of\n\u201cnext\u201d and \u201cimmediately.\u201d See Rancho at \u00b6 21. Doing so establishes that \u201cnext\u201d\nand \u201cimmediately\u201d are synonymous, as the dissenters carefully demonstrated.\n {\u00b6 22} One source cited by the dissenters defined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting); id. at \u00b6 38 (DeWine, J.,\ndissenting), citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002). Another\ndefined \u201cnext\u201d as \u201c[n]earest; closest; immediately following.\u201d (Emphasis in\noriginal.) Id. at \u00b6 28 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting), citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n(6th Ed. 1990). And a thesaurus identified \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d as synonyms\nof \u201cnearest.\u201d Id., citing Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (4th Ed. 1977). What is\nmore, as Justice DeWine observed, decisions by Ohio courts pointed in the same\ndirection, deeming \u201cnext preceding\u201d as synonymous with \u201cimmediately\npreceding.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 41 (DeWine, J., dissenting), citing Cincinnati v. Kirk, 20 Ohio\nApp. 452, 453 (1st Dist. 1925), and Mansfield v. Hunt, 10 Ohio C.D. 567, 569, 1900\nWL 1068 (5th Dist. 1900). The lead opinion failed to furnish any lexical authorities\nor decisions by Ohio courts cutting the other way. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 23} Citing several examples, the dissenters also showed that the Revised\nCode uses \u201cnext preceding\u201d synonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding.\u201d\nConsider two. First, Chief Justice O\u2019Connor cited a statute requiring prior notice\nof public auctions of personal property by either or both of two methods: (1) by\nplacing notice of the sale in a \u201c\u2018newspaper of general circulation in the county\nduring a period of fifteen days next preceding the sale\u2019 \u201d and/or (2) by posting an\nadvertisement in five public places where the sale would take place \u201c\u2018not less than\nfifteen days next preceding the sale.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 30 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting),\nquoting R.C. 2113.41(A). In either event, the property had to be sold \u201c\u2018at a fixed\nprice or for the best price obtainable.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting R.C. 2113.40. As Chief Justice\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nO\u2019Connor observed, under the lead opinion\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnext preceding,\u201d\nnotice of the auction could be provided years in advance. But that outcome would\nplainly frustrate the statute\u2019s goal of ensuring attendance at the auction and\nconcomitantly drive down the auction prices.\n {\u00b6 24} A second example of the Revised Code\u2019s use of \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nsynonymously with \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d can be found in Justice DeWine\u2019s\nRocco dissent, which cites a statute concerning watershed-district budgets. He\nnoted that the statute\u2019s third paragraph requires certification of an annual budget to\nthe county commissioners and that its fourth paragraph directs the county\ncommissioners to perform specified duties \u201c\u2018[u]pon receipt of the certification\nunder the next preceding paragraph of this section.\u2019 \u201d Id., 2017-Ohio-4466, at \u00b6 40\n(DeWine, J., dissenting), quoting R.C. 6105.08. Reading the two paragraphs\ntogether, Justice DeWine explained, \u201c[t]he fourth paragraph makes sense only if\n\u2018the next preceding paragraph\u2019 is the third paragraph, i.e., the immediately\npreceding paragraph.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 25} Unlike the dissents, the lead opinion in Rocco offers no examples\nfrom the Revised Code to support its interpretation of the Westlake Charter\nprovision at issue. See id. at \u00b6 14-18 (lead opinion).\n {\u00b6 26} The above discussion establishes that \u201cimmediately preceding\u201d and\n\u201cnext preceding\u201d are synonyms, and it undercuts the view expressed in the Rocco\nlead opinion that the phrases must have different meanings based on the canon\nknown as the presumption of consistent usage. That canon provides that \u201ca material\nvariation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.\u201d (Boldface deleted.) Reading\nLaw at 170. But although this court has invoked the canon in numerous decisions,\nsee, e.g., Metro. Secs. Co. v. Warren State Bank, 117 Ohio St. 69, 76 (1927); Obetz\nv. McClain, 2021-Ohio-1706, \u00b6 21, it is not ironclad. As Justice DeWine pointed\nout, the canon has been frowned on by no less than the late Justice Joseph Story of\nthe United States Supreme Court. Rocco at \u00b6 46 (DeWine, J., dissenting) (noting\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nthe criticism that the canon assumes an unrealistic level of perfection in legal\ndrafting). As with most canons, the presumption of consistent usage makes sense\nwhen applied \u201cpragmatically\u201d but may be overcome \u201cby context.\u201d Reading Law at\n171. For the reasons given in the dissenting opinions of Chief Justice O\u2019Connor\nand Justice DeWine, context should have trumped the presumption in Rocco.\n {\u00b6 27} Applying the logic of the Rocco dissenters here, we conclude that\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter requires that ward candidates for the\nWhitehall City Council have resided in their respective wards for at least the two\nyears immediately preceding the election at issue. The fact that Section 23(a) of\nthe charter specifies that mayoral candidates \u201cshall have been residents of the City\nfor three years immediately prior to the regular municipal election at which they\nseek election\u201d does not, as respondents argue, require a different result. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondents\u2019 view is that had the drafters of the charter intended to require\nward candidates to have been residents of their respective wards for a period of time\nimmediately prior to the election, as the charter provides with respect to mayoral\ncandidates, the drafters would have used wording to that effect. But that argument,\nwhich appeals to the presumption of consistent usage, fails for all the reasons\nexplained above. Moreover, unlike in Rocco, (1) the two competing phrases here\nare not in close proximity to each other and (2) Section 3(a) does not place the\nindefinite article \u201ca\u201d directly before the phrase \u201cnext preceding.\u201d Thus, even if we\nconsidered the lead opinion in Rocco persuasive, the difference between the\nstructure of the charter at issue in that case and the structure of the charter at issue\nhere would counsel against reliance on that opinion in this case.\n {\u00b6 28} The fact that we do not apply the presumption of consistent usage in\nthis case does not mean that it may never be invoked in a future case. Rather, as\nthe dissenters in Rocco explained, there will be some cases\u2014like this one\u2014in\nwhich the canon should be set aside. Indeed, because \u201c[n]o canon of interpretation\nis absolute,\u201d the force of a canon in any particular case \u201cmay be overcome by the\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\nstrength of differing principles that point in other directions.\u201d (Boldface deleted.)\nReading Law at 59.\n {\u00b6 29} In the end, it is plain to us that the board\u2019s denial of Elmore\u2019s protest\nwas unauthorized by law because it failed to give proper effect to Section 3(a) of\nthe Whitehall Charter. Because Section 3(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnext preceding\u201d\nmeans \u201cimmediately preceding,\u201d we conclude that Stein had to have resided in\nWard 4 for at least the two years immediately preceding the November 4, 2025\ngeneral election. Because Stein does not meet this requirement, she cannot appear\non the general-election ballot.\n B. Determining to whom the two-year residency requirement applies\n {\u00b6 30} Stein alone advances a more ambitious argument as to why we\nshould deny the writ. In her view, the two-year residency requirement of Section\n3(a) of the Whitehall Charter does not apply to her at all; rather, she says that the\nrequirement applies only to candidates running to be at-large members of the city\ncouncil. According to Stein, the requirement does not apply to ward candidates,\nbecause of the \u201cand\u201d that separates the reference to ward candidates from the\nreference to at-large candidates. By this logic, Stein need only have resided in\nWard 4 at some point in time for any period\u2014say, a day\u2014to qualify as a Ward 4\ncandidate. Because the parties do not dispute that Stein has previously resided in\nWard 4, adopting her argument would mean that her name should remain certified\nfor placement on the ballot.\n {\u00b6 31} Although courts use rules of grammar to determine the meaning of\nlegal texts, see Stiner v. Amazon, Inc., 2020-Ohio-4632, \u00b6 14, Stein fails to identify\na grammar principle that we could apply here to help determine whether, as she\nsays, the residency requirement modifies only the clause applicable to at-large\ncandidates. Instructive here is the series-qualifier canon, which provides that\n\u201c[w]hen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or\nverbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the\n\f January Term, 2025\n\nentire series\u201d (boldface deleted), Reading Law at 147. The Reading Law treatise\noffers an illustration of this canon, explaining that the phrase \u201c[i]nstitutions or\nsocieties that are charitable in nature\u201d (italics deleted) should be understood as\nmeaning that \u201cthe institutions as well as the societies must be charitable.\u201d Id. at\n148 (calling this an example of a \u201cpostpositive modifier\u201d because the qualifying\nphrase is \u201cpositioned after\u201d what it modifies). Providing a second illustration, the\ntreatise says that a qualifying phrase should not carry over when a \u201cdeterminer (a,\nthe, some, etc.) [is] repeated before the second element.\u201d (Italics in original.) Id.\nThus, the phrase \u201c[t]he charitable institutions or the societies\u201d (italics deleted)\nshould be understood as meaning \u201cthat the societies need not be charitable\u201d due to\nthe presence of the second \u201cthe.\u201d Id.\n {\u00b6 32} In this case, Section 3(a)\u2019s constructions are parallel and there is no\ndeterminer before the second element, thus suggesting that the two-year residency\nrequirement applies both to ward candidates and to at-large candidates. We\nrecognize that Section 3(a) arguably does not fit neatly within the canon\u2019s technical\ndefinition, because the constructions at issue here are wordier than the examples in\nthe treatise and are not strictly composed of either all nouns or verbs in a series.\nBut another example, aided by a dose of pragmatism, helps explain why the\nunderlying logic of the canon should nonetheless apply here.\n {\u00b6 33} Suppose a school administrator were to say: \u201cMiddle-school\nstudents scheduled to participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their\nanswers at the microphone in room 101 and elementary-school students scheduled\nto participate in today\u2019s noon spelling bee shall announce their answers at the\nmicrophone in room 102 without the aid of a dictionary.\u201d It makes no sense to\nthink that the middle-school students are permitted to announce their answers by\nreading from a dictionary but that the elementary-school students are not. By\nsimilar logic, it makes no sense to think that Section 3(a) permits interloping ward\ncandidates but forbids interloping at-large candidates. Plainly, both types of\n\f SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\ncandidates are expected to be responsive to their constituents and attuned to their\ninterests, and the two-year residency requirement promotes that goal.\n {\u00b6 34} In sum, we conclude that the two-year residency requirement of\nSection 3(a) of the Whitehall Charter applies both to ward candidates and to at-\nlarge candidates for the Whitehall City Council.\n III. CONCLUSION\n {\u00b6 35} Because Stein\u2019s candidacy does not comply with Section 3(a) of the\nWhitehall Charter, we grant a writ of prohibition preventing the board from placing\nher name on the November 4, 2025 general-election ballot.\n Writ granted.\n _________________\n McTigue & Colombo, L.L.C., J.

The Tennessee Department of\nChildren\u2019s Services (\u201cDCS\u201d) filed a petition in the Juvenile Court for Hawkins County\n(\u201cthe Juvenile Court\u201d) seeking to terminate the parental rights of Rikiya P. (\u201cMother\u201d) to\nher minor children Annabelle, Jasmine, and Liam (\u201cthe Children,\u201d collectively), as well as\nthe parental rights of Daniel R. (\u201cFather\u201d) to Liam.1 The Children had been removed from\nMother and Father\u2019s custody because Mother starved and beat Kenna, Father\u2019s daughter\nby another mother.2 Father was aware of the abuse but failed to protect Kenna. The\nJuvenile Court terminated Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of severe\nchild abuse. Mother and Father appeal. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground\nof severe child abuse was proven against Mother and Father by clear and convincing\nevidence. We find further, as did the Juvenile Court, that clear and convincing evidence\nsupports termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as being in the best interest\nof the Children. We affirm.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Juvenile Court Affirmed;\n Case Remanded\n\nD. MICHAEL SWINEY, C.J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J.

Davenport, V, Kingsport, Tennessee, for the appellant, Rikiya P.\n\nEmily C. Morley, Rogersville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Daniel R.3\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter, and Mara L. Cunningham, Assistant\nAttorney General, for the appellee, the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services.\n\nOPINION\n\nBackground\n\nMother is the mother of Annabelle, born May 2013; Jasmine, born June 2014; and\nLiam, born December 2019. Aaron P. is the father of Annabelle and Jasmine. Father is\nthe father of Liam. Father has an older daughter, Kenna, by another mother. At the\ninception of this case, Mother, Father, Aaron P., the Children, and Kenna all lived under\nthe same roof. In May 2021, Kenna, then age sixteen, tried to run away. A neighbor\nstopped Kenna and returned her. Law enforcement later performed a welfare check but\ndid not see Kenna. That night, law enforcement returned. Mother and Father told the\nofficers that Kenna was away visiting a relative. That was false. Law enforcement found\nKenna hiding under a bed. She was bruised, emaciated, and had a shaved head. Afterward,\nthe Children and Kenna were removed into state custody. DCS filed a petition for\ndependency and neglect, but it was never adjudicated.\n\nOn May 25, 2022, DCS filed a petition seeking to terminate Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s\nparental rights to their respective children. Kenna has since reached majority age. DCS\nproceeded against Mother and Father on the ground of severe child abuse. Trial on DCS\u2019s\npetition was on November 29, November 30, and December 1, 2023. We proceed to review\nthe pertinent testimony from trial. Both Mother and Father declined to testify, invoking\ntheir rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nDr. Andrew Steven Wilt (\u201cDr. Wilt\u201d), an expert witness and the doctor who treated\nKenna after her removal, testified by deposition. Kenna suffered from \u201csevere\nmalnutrition.\u201d Kenna\u2019s weight for her age was less than the bottom first percentile, as was\nher body mass index. Dr. Wilt said it was most medically reasonable that Kenna\u2019s\nmalnutrition was not due to anything Kenna had done to herself but was the result of her\nbeing denied enough food. Kenna weighed 83 pounds when she was admitted to the\nhospital. Kenna had shown signs of \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d in which a malnourished\nperson does not properly handle the reintroduction of proper nutrients, which in turn can\n Father\u2019s previous attorney, Gerald T. Eidson, submitted Father\u2019s appellate brief.\n -2-\n\flead to death. In addition to starvation, Kenna showed signs of having been abused\nphysically, including facial bruising; a subconjunctival hemorrhage (a bleed in the white\npart of one\u2019s eye); bruises on her back; and bruises on her scapula. Kenna told Dr. Wilt\nthat Mother had hit her with a broom and a dustpan. Kenna also reported that she had lived\nunder strict rules about eating and drinking. For breakfast, she tended to have pack of\noatmeal. She was allowed to eat ramen or Chef Boyardee for lunch and dinner. Despite\nthese meager offerings, Kenna remained hungry. When the home ran out of oatmeal, she\nwas given a protein drink instead. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s malnourishment was\nsuch that it was likely to cause severe bodily injury or death. In Dr. Wilt\u2019s view, a\nreasonably prudent medical professional who saw Kenna in the condition she was in would\nhave made a referral.\n\nLisa Hawryluk (\u201cHawryluk\u201d), a DCS caseworker, took the stand to testify. Father\ntold Hawryluk that Kenna had done this to them, and he did not want her back in his home.\nMother likewise blamed Kenna. The thrust of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s positions was that\nthe family\u2019s problems were brought about by Kenna\u2019s bad behavior, not their parenting.\nHawryluk said that Kenna, now out of the family home, was glad to drink something\nbesides water and consumed whatever was given to her. On cross-examination, Hawryluk\nacknowledged that the Children appeared clean and did not have any marks visible.\n\nRetired detective Jeff Greer (\u201cGreer\u201d) testified. Greer saw Kenna at Mother\u2019s and\nFather\u2019s home in her malnourished state. Kenna appeared \u201cvery emaciated\u201d to Greer. She\nwas bruised around one eye and her head. According to Greer, the other children did not\nlook emaciated. Father told Greer that Kenna \u201creally didn\u2019t eat,\u201d but admitted they used\nfood as a punishment. Mother, in turn, told Greer that Kenna refused to eat. Corporal\nAnthony Crosby (\u201cCrosby\u201d) of the Hawkins County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified, as well.\nCrosby said that Kenna looked \u201cseverely abused.\u201d She had a black eye and looked like she\nwas \u201cliterally starving to death.\u201d\n\nConstance Cole (\u201cCole\u201d), a former DCS worker, testified next. Cole previously\nworked on the Children\u2019s case. Cole said that the Children were placed in a home together\nwhile Kenna was placed in a separate home. Cole acknowledged that Mother and Father\nhave a parental attachment to the Children but said that it is not of a healthy kind.\nAnnabelle broke down and cried at the first parental visitation. Cole said that she did not\nbelieve this was due to Annabelle missing her parents. In fact, Annabelle said that she was\nscared because \u201cthey beated me.\u201d However, Cole acknowledged that some of the visits\nwent well. Visitation remained supervised. Annabelle and Jasmine told Cole that they\nwere fearful of returning home. Annabelle and Jasmine said that the parents had been mean\nto Kenna. With respect to positive steps taken by Mother and Father, Cole testified that\nthey had housing and jobs. They also underwent parenting classes. All the same, in Cole\u2019s\nview, the Children should be freed for adoption. Cole explained why this was her view:\n -3-\n\f The abuse that Kenna received while in their care. I would be afraid that\n other children would face that same abuse and the older they get they would\n face the same abuse and it was horrific. Every time I met with Kenna she\n was vibrant and I never saw the things that were described to me by the\n Defendants in her. I never saw the attitudes or any of that in her. I saw a\n thriving young lady. I would be fearful for the other children.\n\nSchool counselor Jason Floyd (\u201cFloyd\u201d) testified. Regarding Annabelle and\nJasmine, Floyd said: \u201cOn a couple occasions separately and every now and again they\nwould want to come in together. They would say they are starving us and not giving us\nany food. When I would ask questions to explore that further they wouldn\u2019t say anything\nelse.\u201d Floyd said that Annabelle was very anxious early on, and Jasmine exhibited\ndisruptive behaviors. In addition, Tracy Burke (\u201cBurke\u201d), a CASA volunteer who worked\nwith the Children, testified. Annabelle told Burke that Mother pulled her hair, slapped her\nin the face or legs, and withheld food from her. Even still, Annabelle said that this was\n\u201cnothing like what they had seen done to Kenna.\u201d Annabelle also reported that Father once\npulled a gun on Kenna.\n\nLarissa J., Kenna\u2019s foster mother, testified.4 Kenna came to live with Larissa J. in\nMay 2021. According to Larissa J., Kenna initially looked \u201cvery frail and skinny.\u201d\nKenna\u2019s head was shaved, and she had a lot of bruises. When Kenna came to live with\nLarissa J., she ate regularly. Kenna then weighed between 80 and 90 pounds. Since then,\nshe has risen to around 140 pounds. Larissa J. enrolled Kenna in school. Kenna did not\nhave any high school credits when she was enrolled. Nevertheless, Kenna has since\ngraduated and has a job.\n\nKenna testified next. Kenna, age 19 at trial, is Father\u2019s daughter. Kenna was asked\nto describe a typical day in Mother and Father\u2019s home. According to Kenna, she woke up\n\u201csuper early,\u201d went to the living room to sit all day, and then went to bed. Mother made\nKenna sit on the floor in a certain precise way as a form of punishment. If Kenna failed to\ndo so, Mother hit her or yelled at her. Kenna needed permission to use the restroom.\nOtherwise, an alarm went off signaling that she could go. Kenna had no television or\ncomputer. For breakfast, she had one bowl of plain oatmeal. This was not by Kenna\u2019s\nchoice. For lunch, she was allowed to have canned soup or Chef Boyardee. It was not\nheated; she had to eat it out of the can. Dinner was the same. If Kenna asked for more,\nMother yelled at her. Kenna could drink only water. Meanwhile, cameras monitored\nKenna in the home. Kenna testified that Father threatened her with a gun twice. Kenna\nwas asked if Father ever tried to protect her from Mother. Kenna said that Father did \u201ca\n Larissa J.\u2019s first name is spelled Larisa in some parts of the record.\n -4-\n\fcouple of times,\u201d but he told her it was not for her benefit, but to protect Mother from\ngetting in trouble.\n\nOn cross-examination, Kenna said that her own mother left her when she was a year\nor a year-and-a-half old, and Mother was at one time a mother figure to her. Asked why\nshe did not climb out of her bedroom window to find food, Kenna said that the window\nwas screwed shut. Kenna acknowledged certain correspondence in which she admitted to\nbeing stubborn. Kenna also said that Mother was \u201cjust a typical mom\u201d to Annabelle and\nJasmine.\n\nMike Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), the Children\u2019s DCS case manager, testified. Smith said that\nthe Children are doing well in foster care. Jasmine and Annabelle were two years behind\nin school, based on their prior lack of education. However, they have made significant\nimprovements. Regarding the Children\u2019s attachment to Mother and Father, Smith testified:\n\nQ. Would you be able to tell the Court if you believe there is a secure and\n healthy parental attachment between these children and the parents?\n A. This is a difficult situation. Annabelle and Jasmine both have disclosed\n that they both don\u2019t want to have any contact with their mother. There are\n certainly concerns there. They both have disclosed that they love their father\n and they would like to see their father. I have seen an attachment there in\n those visits. Liam due to his age obviously he recognizes his mother and\n father. He likes seeing them and he is excited to see them. The question I\n have wondered about with the attachment factor with Liam and generally\n when I see a two or three year old at the end of visits whenever there is some\n kind of separation from the visits a child will normally scream, cry, it is\n usually a traumatic experience to separate the child from the visit. We never\n have that issue with Liam. He is happy to go. He is happy to come and\n happy to go. That has always been an odd situation.\n\nSmith testified that while Father was engaged during the visits, Mother tended to\nuse her phone on the couch. Smith acknowledged that Mother and Father paid child\nsupport. Asked if Mother or Father had undergone a mental health intake, Smith said:\n\nThere is some question with that. I have requested documentation. It is not\n to my liking but it is to her credit, [Mother] has sent me a screen shot of a\n piece of paper from her therapist, but as far as ongoing or what is being\n discussed in therapy, I don\u2019t have any knowledge of it. [Father] has reported\n that he is going to Camelot. I haven\u2019t had any verification from that. I think\n it was Camelot and I may be mistaken as far as the provider but he has\n reported that he is receiving therapy. . . .\n -5-\n\fAt a February 2023 visit, Jasmine locked herself in a bathroom crying that Mother abused\nthem. Jasmine threatened to kill herself. She also threatened to stab Mother if she had to\nsee her again. After this incident, Jasmine spent a week in the hospital. Mother\u2019s visits\nwith Annabelle and Jasmine were suspended.\n\nNext at trial, Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s employer testified favorably about Mother and\nFather. In addition, Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., testified favorably about Mother and\nFather, as well. Pamela P. testified, in effect, that Kenna\u2019s bad behavior was the problem\nin the household, not Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parenting. When confronted with photographs\nof Kenna, Pamela P. testified:\n\nQ. You stated that you left in March, 2021, is that correct?\n A. That\u2019s correct.\n Q. Can you look at this picture and see if that is how Kenna looked when you\n left?\n A. Well, she has her pick marks. I was not here for this picture and that\n timing exactly. I have seen her have injuries before from nobody being at\n home.\n THE COURT: She asked you if that is how she looked when you left?\n A. When I last saw her?\n THE COURT: Yes.\n A. No. She was thin and she had pick marks but, no, I didn\u2019t see this.\n THE COURT: Thank you.\n Q. Same thing. Did she look like this when you left? Is that her haircut that\n she had when you left?\n A. No, Ma\u2019am, but it is the haircut she described that she wanted.\n Q. Oh, it is?\n A. Yes.\n Q. Okay, that is what she said she wanted her hair to look like?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. Okay, thank you. Did she have black eyes when you last saw her and is\n that an injury she would have inflicted upon herself?\n A. Twice. One time she had one black eye and the second time she had two\n and no one was there all day. She didn\u2019t expect to see me.\n Q. Did you ask her about her injuries?\n A. Oh, I had an accident and she would go hide in her room.\n Q. Are you aware that both Annabelle and Jasmine have made statements\n that they also had food restrictions in the home of your daughter?\n A. I am not aware but I know better.\n Q. You don\u2019t believe the children are saying that?\n -6-\n\f A. I believe I have broken children that never got the help they wanted and\n they could be coerced in any way.\n Q. You believe these children are being coerced?\n A. Yes, Ma\u2019am.\n Q. What evidence do you have of them being coerced?\n A. What evidence do I have?\n Q. Yes.\n A. I can\u2019t state because it is evidenced presented through other people.\n Q. You can\u2019t state?\n THE COURT: You can answer her question, Ma\u2019am.\n A. Why do I think so because other people have told me and I know the kids\n are broken and I have been told in the past that they are in fear of everything\n going on and they can be coerced. I know they always had plenty of food.\n\nIn January 2024, the Juvenile Court entered its final order in which it terminated\nMother\u2019s parental rights to the Children and Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. The Juvenile\nCourt found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the ground of severe child abuse had\nbeen proven against both Mother and Father. The Juvenile Court also found that clear and\nconvincing evidence supported termination of Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s parental rights as\nbeing in the Children\u2019s best interest. The Juvenile Court specifically found Kenna to be a\ncredible witness. The Juvenile Court also credited the testimony of witnesses Hawryluk,\nGreer, Crosby, Larissa J., Cole, Floyd, Burke, and Smith. By contrast, the Juvenile Court\nspecifically found the testimony of Mother\u2019s mother, Pamela P., in which she blamed\nKenna for the family\u2019s situation, not credible. In its detailed Memorandum Opinion\nincorporated into its termination order, the Juvenile Court found, in relevant part:\n\nOn May 17, 2021, Kenna was 16 years old, and had been living . . .\n with her father, two other adults, and three younger children. When law\n enforcement discovered Kenna under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed they knew\n immediately from her appearance and condition that she needed medical\n attention. Kenna looked emaciated, as if she was \u201cstarving to death.\u201d She\n had bruising on her face and head, and she had a bizarre haircut.\n Kenna was transported by ambulance to Hawkins County Memorial\n Hospital, and then to Johnson City Medical Center, where law enforcement\u2019s\n observations were confirmed. When Kenna arrived at JCMC she appeared\n visibly dirty, malnourished and bruised. Her appearance was described by\n Dr. Wilt as \u201cwasted or cachectic.\u201d Her ribs were visible, and her hips and\n spine were protruding. In addition to the bruising on her face and head, she\n had bruising down her back and on her shoulder blades. Upon admission,\n Kenna was approximately 5\u2019 6\u201d tall, and weighed 83 pounds. Kenna was\n diagnosed as being severely malnourished due to caloric restriction by the\n -7-\n\fcaregivers in her home. Her malnourishment was so severe that her life was\nat risk from refeeding syndrome. Even in the face of Kenna\u2019s wasted\nappearance, and her obvious need for immediate medical care, Respondents\ncould not recall the last time she had seen a doctor and did not seek medical\nhelp.\n Kenna has also consistently recounted her physical and emotional\nabuse at the hands of Respondents: from being beaten by [Mother]; to being\nthreatened with a hand gun by [Father]; to having her sense of femininity\nsheared away by [Aaron P.]. It is evident to the Court that all three\nrespondents actively participated in her systematic starvation, and in her\nextreme isolation. This evidence was uncontested at trial, and the Court finds\nby a preponderance of the evidence that Kenna suffered from abuse and\nneglect.\n\n***\n\nKenna suffered no burns at the hands of Respondents. No evidence\nwas presented at trial that Kenna suffered any broken bones, or a concussion.\nThe Court does find, however, that being struck in the head by [Mother] with\nher fists and a broom was likely to cause a broken nose or concussion. No\nevidence was introduced that the child suffered subdural bleeding, cerebral\nedema, or a brain contusion. Upon her admission to JCMC, Kenna did have\na subconjunctival hemorrhage. Kenna did have deeply disturbing bruising\non her face and head, and along her spinal column and across her shoulders.\nWhile Kenna was defeminized by her forced haircut, it did not result in\npermanent or protracted disfigurement. Kenna did report that [Mother] had\nhit her with a broom, a bowl, and a belt. Still, Kenna\u2019s wasted condition does\nnot quite fit squarely within any of the abhorrent injuries specifically detailed\nin the statutory definition. The Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201csevere bodily injury\u201d\nelement, however, does not end there.\n While the statutory definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d includes\nspecific examples, it is \u201cnot limited to\u201d those listed examples. Our Supreme\nCourt has held that the words \u201cincludes, but not limited to\u201d are terms of\nenlargement, not terms of restriction. See Lovlace v Copley, 418 S.W.3d 1,\n18 (Tenn. 2013). This language allows a court to employ its aforementioned\ncommon sense to determine whether an injury suffered by a child can\nreasonably be defined as a serious bodily injury. As such, the Court finds\nthat any reasonable person would conclude that a child who is so severely\nmalnourished that she requires hospitalization and medically monitored\nnourishment, has sustained a serious bodily injury. Accordingly, the Court\n\n-8-\n\ffinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the abuse and neglect suffered\nby Kenna was likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n Likewise, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nabuse and neglect suffered by Kenna was likely to cause death. Kenna\u2019s\nmalnourishment was so severe that she exhibited signs of refeeding\nsyndrome, which poses a severe risk of death. Dr. Wilt testified\nunequivocally that Kenna\u2019s severe malnourishment was likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nPerhaps the most damning evidence of Respondents\u2019 knowing\nexposure of Kenna to severe abuse is the fact that they tried to hide her from\nthe authorities. When a Sheriff\u2019s deputy first responded to the residence for\na welfare check, [Aaron P.] told Kenna to hide under his bed, and told law\nenforcement she was not there. When authorities returned to the residence,\nKenna was again told to hide under [Aaron P.\u2019s] bed, and [Mother] and\n[Father] lied about Kenna\u2019s whereabouts. Respondents\u2019 actions clearly\nbetray a consciousness of guilt. They knew that Kenna\u2019s discovery by\nauthorities would reveal the abuse they had inflicted on her. The Court,\ntherefore, finds by clear and convincing evidence that [Father], [Mother], and\n[Aaron P.] each knowingly exposed Kenna to abuse or neglect likely to cause\nsevere bodily injury or death.\n Furthermore, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that\n[Father] and [Mother] used force on Kenna likely to cause serious bodily\ninjury or death. As discussed above, [Mother] used her hands and objects,\nsuch as a broom, to strike Kenna in the face and head. This force was likely\nto cause a broken bone or concussion. Additionally, the uncontradicted\nevidence at trial was that [Father] twice threatened Kenna with a gun; on one\noccasion pointing a loaded gun at her forehead and stating, \u201cI want to shoot\nyou.\u201d There is no doubt in the Court\u2019s mind that this behavior constitutes a\nuse of force likely to result in serious bodily injury or death.\n\n***\n\nThe Court, having addressed the underlying facts and elements of the\nstatutory ground of severe child abuse, must now address the ground itself.\n\u201cOnce these specific underlying facts are established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, the court must step back to look at the combined weight of all\nof those facts, to see if they clearly and convincingly show severe child\nabuse.\u201d Id. at 457 quoting In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 591-592 (Tenn. App.\n\n-9-\n\f2012). The Court finds that the Department has proved by clear and\nconvincing evidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] have\ncommitted severe child abuse as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102.\n\n***\n\n[Best Interest]\n\n(A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the\nchild\u2019s critical need for stability and continuity of placement throughout\nthe child\u2019s minority. None of the children are currently in an adoptive\nplacement. The children have also been removed from Respondents\u2019 custody\nfor more than two and a half years. Respondents\u2019 therapeutic visitation has\nnever been increased. In fact, [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was\nsuspended at the time of trial. There has never been a trial home placement,\nor even unsupervised visitation. Considering that Respondents\u2019 case for a\nreturn of custody has not advanced at all in more than two and a half years,\nthe instant termination of their parental rights will free the children for\nadoption and perhaps facilitate a pre-adoptive placement. This factor weighs\nin favor of the termination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is\nlikely to have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical\ncondition. A return of Jasmine and Annabelle to the custody of [Mother]\nand/or [Aaron P.] would have a negative effect on their emotional and\npsychological condition. Both girls were present in the home when Kenna\nwas being severely abused. Jasmine witnessed her mother pulling Kenna\u2019s\nhair, and Kenna screaming. She witnessed her mother yelling at Kenna to sit\ncorrectly. Annabelle also witnessed the severe abuse of Kenna. She\ndescribed scary events, and recounted her own maltreatment. At the prospect\nof a visit with her parents, Jasmine threatened to hurt herself and her mother,\nresulting in her admission to Woodridge Psychiatric Hospital. Annabelle did\nnot want to visit with her parents, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic\nstress disorder. All of these facts were uncontradicted by [Mother] and\n[Aaron P.] at trial. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the termination\nof [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n There was no evidence presented at trial regarding Liam\u2019s emotional,\npsychological, or medical condition, likely due to his young age. The Court\nis unable to make a factual finding regarding what effect a change of\ncaretakers would have on Liam. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\nagainst the termination of [Father\u2019s] or [Mother\u2019s] parental rights to Liam.\n\n-10-\n\f (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability\nin meeting the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety\nneeds. Respondents have not had a meaningful opportunity to meet these\nneeds in more than two and a half years. Of course, the children\u2019s removal\nwas the result of Respondents\u2019 own actions. The evidence is undisputed that\nat the time of their removal, the children subject to this petition appeared\nwell. They did not appear malnourished; they were not bruised like Kenna.\nThe evidence is also undisputed that prior to their removal they were\nallegedly being home schooled with a curriculum not accredited in\nTennessee, and that they were educationally behind. It is equally undisputed\nthat when in Respondents\u2019 custody, the children lived in a home of casual\nviolence and abuse. A home in which adults assault, threaten and abuse one\nchild does not meet the safety needs of any child. This factor weighs in favor\nof termination of all Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy\nparental attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable\nexpectation that the parent can create such attachment. As already\ndiscussed, the evidence presented at trial clearly establishes that neither\n[Mother] nor [Aaron P.] have a secure and healthy parental attachment with\nJasmine or Annabelle. Moreover, neither [Mother] nor [Aaron P.] testified\nregarding their attachment with, or love for, their children, or how they\nexpect to recreate that relationship. There was simply no evidence\nintroduced at trial that would allow the Court to conclude that there is a\nreasonable expectation that [Mother] or [Aaron P.] can create a healthy\nparental attachment with Annabelle or Jasmine. The undisputed evidence\nsuggests the opposite.\n At the time of trial, Liam was nearly four years old. He has been\nremoved from his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s custody for significantly more than\nhalf his young life. Again, neither [Father] nor [Mother] elected to testify\nregarding their parental attachment with or love for Liam, or how they hope\nto create such attachment. This factor weighs in favor of the termination of\nall Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other\ncontact with the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate\na positive relationship with the child. The evidence at trial establishes that,\nwhen available, Respondents regularly attended therapeutic visitation with\nthe children, and that Respondents behavior during the visits was largely\nappropriate. [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] visitation was suspended in 2023,\nthough the suspension does not appear to have resulted from their behavior\nat the visit. As of trial, [Father] was still attending visits with Liam.\n\n-11-\n\f With regard to [Mother] and [Aaron P.], this factor weighs neither in\nfavor of nor against termination. With regard to [Father], this factor weighs\nagainst termination.\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home. The\nevidence presented at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and\nAnnabelle are fearful of their parents. Jasmine was so fearful of a visit that\nshe credibly threated [sic] to hurt herself and her mother, requiring her\nadmission to a psychiatric hospital. Annabelle has consistently maintained\nthat she does not want to see her parents, and she has been diagnosed with\npost-traumatic stress disorder. While [Father] is not the father of Jasmine or\nAnnabelle, the Court has no doubt their fear also extends to him. There was\nno evidence introduced at trial that Liam was in fear of his parents.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s\nhousehold trigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or\npost-traumatic symptoms. Much as in the previous factor, the evidence\nintroduced at trial is clear and undisputed that Jasmine and Annabelle are\nterrified of all Respondents. There is simply no question that Respondents\ntrigger and exacerbate the girls\u2019 experience of trauma and post-traumatic\nsymptoms. The Court does not have to speculate, as there is undisputed\nevidence of this actually happening. Again, there was no evidence presented\nat trial that would allow the Court to make this same conclusion with regard\nto Liam.\n With regard to [Mother\u2019s] and [Aaron P.\u2019s] rights to Jasmine and\nAnnabelle, this factor weighs heavily in favor of termination. With regard to\n[Mother\u2019s] and [Father\u2019s] rights to Liam, this factor weighs neither in favor\nof nor against termination.\n (H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment\nwith another person or persons in the absence of the parent. The children\nare not in a pre-adoptive home. There was no evidence introduced at trial\nthat the children had developed a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson who is still involved in their care in the absence of the parent. The\nchildren had become attached with their initial foster parent who had hoped\nto adopt them, but due to the development of a serious illness was no longer\nable to care for them. Still, the children do not have a healthy attachment\nwith Respondents. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor against\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n\n-12-\n\f (I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships\nwith persons other than parents and caregivers, including biological or\nfoster siblings, and the likely impact of various available outcomes on\nthese relationships and the child\u2019s access to information about the\nchild\u2019s heritage. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle have been placed together\nsince their removal from Respondents more than two and a half years ago.\nThere is direct evidence that Jasmine and Annabelle rely on their relationship\nfor comfort and safety. Their school counsellor, Mr. Floyd, testified that the\nchildren would want to meet with him together. Annabelle scolds her CAC\ninterviewer that she and Jasmine could have been interviewed together. It is\nevident to the Court that this sibling relationship is paramount, and is\nessential to the best interest of all three children. Indeed, their relationship\nwith each other has been the only constant in their lives. This factor weighs\nheavily in favor of the Court\u2019s decision being uniform for all three children.\n (J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and\nbeneficial for the child to be in the home of the parent, including\nconsideration of whether there is criminal activity in the home or by the\nparent, or the use of alcohol, controlled substances, or controlled\nsubstance analogues which may render the parent unable to consistently\ncare for the child in a safe and stable manner. No evidence was presented\nthat Respondents had issues with substance abuse. There was testimony that\nRespondents had largely completed the actions steps set forth for them by\nthe Department. There was some dispute as to whether Respondents had\ncompleted a mental health assessment. Of course, Respondents could have\naddressed this question had they elected to testify. They could have also\nintroduced confirming documentation. They did neither. More importantly,\nRespondents did not testify that they had made a lasting adjustment regarding\ntheir abusive conduct, or even deny that such conduct ever happened. There\nis simply no evidence that allows the Court to conclude, in the face of\nundisputed evidence that Respondents severely abused Kenna, that the\nchildren would be safe in their parents\u2019 home. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available\nprograms, services, or community resources to assist in making a lasting\nadjustment of circumstances, conduct, or conditions. The Court\u2019s\nassessment of this factor mirrors that of factor (J). While Respondents\nlargely completed the action steps set forth by the Department, no\ndocumentary evidence was submitted as an exhibit, and there was no\ntestimony that Respondents have made a lasting adjustment to their abusive\nconduct which resulted in the removal of the children from their custody.\n -13-\n\fThe undisputed testimony at trial was that Respondents refused to accept\nresponsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This factor weighs in favor of\ntermination of Respondent\u2019s parental rights.\n (L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist\nthe parent in making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in\nthe custody of the department. The Court cannot conclude from the\nevidence presented at trial that the Department made reasonable efforts to\nassist Respondents in making a lasting adjustment that would allow the return\nof the children. This factor weighs against termination of Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nestablishing paternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or\naddressing the circumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award\nof custody unsafe and not in the child\u2019s best interest. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated a sense of urgency in\nregaining custody of the children, or in addressing the undisputed abuse of\nKenna which led to the removal of the children in the first place.\nRespondents did not testify regarding any steps they had taken to regain\ncustody of the children. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\nRespondents refused to accept responsibility for their abuse of Kenna. This\nfactor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or\nfrequenting the home of the parent, has shown brutality or physical,\nsexual, emotional, or psychological abuse or neglect toward the child or\nany other child or adult. This Court has found by clear and convincing\nevidence that each of [Father], [Mother], and [Aaron P.] severely abused\nKenna. This factor weighs heavily in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019\nparental rights.\n (O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for\nthe child or any other child. Liam, Jasmine, and Annabelle resided in a\nhome in which Respondents were severely abusing another child. Jasmine\nand Annabelle were twice removed from the custody of [Mother] and [Aaron\nP.] before their current removal. The Court simply cannot find that the\nchildren were ever provided safe and stable care by Respondents. This factor\nweighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the child to thrive. No evidence was\npresented at trial that Respondents demonstrated an understanding of the\nbasic and specific needs required for the children to thrive. The undisputed\nevidence is that Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was\n\n-14-\n\f occurring, which has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine.\n This factor weighs in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s\n basic and specific needs and in which the child can thrive. No evidence\n was presented at trial that Respondents demonstrated the ability and\n commitment to creating a home that meets the children\u2019s basic and specific\n needs and in which the children can thrive. The undisputed evidence is that\n Respondents provided a home in which severe abuse was occurring, which\n has resulted in lasting trauma to Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs\n in favor of terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n (R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is\n healthy and safe for the child. There was no testimony or other evidence\n introduced at trial regarding the physical environment of any of\n Respondents\u2019 current homes. This factor weighs neither in favor of nor\n against termination.\n (S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token\n financial support for the child. The undisputed testimony at trial was that\n Respondents paid their child support. The amount of support was not\n identified. This factor weighs against termination.\n (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would\n be detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n The Court has found by clear and convincing evidence that each of [Father],\n [Mother], and [Aaron P.] committed severe child abuse against Kenna. The\n undisputed evidence supports this finding. Respondents did not deny the\n abuse; they did not accept responsibility for their conduct. They did not\n address how things have changed. They did not address the trauma suffered\n by Annabelle and Jasmine. This factor weighs heavily in favor of\n terminating Respondents\u2019 parental rights.\n This Court acknowledges, and truly believes, that not all parental\n misconduct is irredeemable. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 877 (Tenn.\n App. 2005). But knowing full well what is at stake, Respondents declined to\n dispute the overwhelming evidence that they severely abused a child;\n declined to accept any responsibility for Kenna\u2019s wasted condition and the\n trauma suffered by Annabelle and Jasmine; and declined to tell the Court\n what steps they have taken to redeem themselves. This Court has no choice\n but to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that the termination of\n Respondents\u2019 parental rights is in the best interest of the children.\n\n(Footnote omitted). Mother and Father timely appealed to this Court.\n -15-\n\f Discussion\n\nWe restate and consolidate Mother\u2019s issues into the following dispositive issues: 1)\nwhether the Juvenile Court erred in finding the ground of severe child abuse against Mother\nand 2) whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of Mother\u2019s parental\nrights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. Father does not challenge the ground for\ntermination found against him but raises an issue as to Liam\u2019s best interest.\n\nAs our Supreme Court has instructed regarding the standard of review in parental\nrights termination cases:\n\nA parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of her child is among the\n oldest of the judicially recognized fundamental liberty interests protected by\n the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.5 Troxel v.\n Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); Stanley\n v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); In re\n Angela E., 303 S.W.3d 240, 250 (Tenn. 2010); In re Adoption of Female\n Child, 896 S.W.2d 546, 547-48 (Tenn. 1995); Hawk v. Hawk, 855 S.W.2d\n 573, 578-79 (Tenn. 1993). But parental rights, although fundamental and\n constitutionally protected, are not absolute. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 250. \u201c\u2018[T]he [S]tate as parens patriae has a special duty to protect minors .\n . . .\u2019 Tennessee law, thus, upholds the [S]tate\u2019s authority as parens patriae\n when interference with parenting is necessary to prevent serious harm to a\n child.\u201d Hawk, 855 S.W.2d at 580 (quoting In re Hamilton, 657 S.W.2d 425,\n 429 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983)); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747,\n 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 250.\n \u201cWhen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks\n not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388. \u201cFew consequences of judicial\n action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u201d Id. at 787, 102\n S.Ct. 1388; see also M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136\n L.Ed.2d 473 (1996). The parental rights at stake are \u201cfar more precious than\n any property right.\u201d Santosky, 455 U.S. at 758-59, 102 S.Ct. 1388.\n Termination of parental rights has the legal effect of reducing the parent to\n the role of a complete stranger and of \u201csevering forever all legal rights and\n U.S. Const. amend. XIV \u00a7 1 (\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without\ndue process of law . . . .\u201d). Similarly, article 1, section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution states \u201c[t]hat no\nman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled,\nor in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers or\nthe law of the land.\u201d\n -16-\n\f obligations of the parent or guardian of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-\n 113(l)(1); see also Santosky, 455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388 (recognizing\n that a decision terminating parental rights is \u201cfinal and irrevocable\u201d). In light\n of the interests and consequences at stake, parents are constitutionally\n entitled to \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d in termination proceedings.\n Santosky, 455 U.S. at 754, 102 S.Ct. 1388; see also Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc.\n Servs. of Durham Cnty., N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d\n 640 (1981) (discussing the due process right of parents to fundamentally fair\n procedures).\n\nAmong the constitutionally mandated \u201cfundamentally fair\n procedures\u201d is a heightened standard of proof \u2013 clear and convincing\n evidence. Santosky, 455 U.S. at 769, 102 S.Ct. 1388. This standard\n minimizes the risk of unnecessary or erroneous governmental interference\n with fundamental parental rights. Id.; In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d 586, 596\n (Tenn. 2010). \u201cClear and convincing evidence enables the fact-finder to\n form a firm belief or conviction regarding the truth of the facts, and\n eliminates any serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of these\n factual findings.\u201d In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596 (citations omitted).\n The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard ensures that the facts are\n established as highly probable, rather than as simply more probable than not.\n In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 861 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); In re M.A.R.,\n 183 S.W.3d 652, 660 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).\n\nTennessee statutes governing parental termination proceedings\n incorporate this constitutionally mandated standard of proof. Tennessee\n Code Annotated section 36-1-113(c) provides:\n\nTermination of parental or guardianship rights must be based\n upon:\n\n(1) A finding by the court by clear and convincing evidence that\n the grounds for termination of parental or guardianship rights\n have been established; and\n (2) That termination of the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s rights is in the\n best interests of the child.\n\nThis statute requires the State to establish by clear and convincing proof that\n at least one of the enumerated statutory grounds6 for termination exists and\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(1)-(13).\n -17-\n\f that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d\n at 250; In re F.R.R., III, 193 S.W.3d 528, 530 (Tenn. 2006); In re Valentine,\n 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). \u201cThe best interests analysis is separate\n from and subsequent to the determination that there is clear and convincing\n evidence of grounds for termination.\u201d In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 254.\n Although several factors relevant to the best interests analysis are statutorily\n enumerated,7 the list is illustrative, not exclusive. The parties are free to offer\n proof of other relevant factors. In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 878. The trial\n court must then determine whether the combined weight of the facts\n \u201camount[s] to clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the child\u2019s\n best interest.\u201d In re Kaliyah S., 455 S.W.3d 533, 555 (Tenn. 2015). These\n requirements ensure that each parent receives the constitutionally required\n \u201cindividualized determination that a parent is either unfit or will cause\n substantial harm to his or her child before the fundamental right to the care\n and custody of the child can be taken away.\u201d In re Swanson, 2 S.W.3d 180,\n 188 (Tenn. 1999).\n\nFurthermore, other statutes impose certain requirements upon trial\n courts hearing termination petitions. A trial court must \u201censure that the\n hearing on the petition takes place within six (6) months of the date that the\n petition is filed, unless the court determines an extension is in the best\n interests of the child.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(k). A trial court must\n \u201center an order that makes specific findings of fact and conclusions of law\n within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d Id. This portion of\n the statute requires a trial court to make \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of\n law as to whether clear and convincing evidence establishes the existence of\n each of the grounds asserted for terminating [parental] rights.\u201d In re Angela\n E., 303 S.W.3d at 255. \u201cShould the trial court conclude that clear and\n convincing evidence of ground(s) for termination does exist, then the trial\n court must also make a written finding whether clear and convincing\n evidence establishes that termination of [parental] rights is in the [child\u2019s]\n best interests.\u201d Id. If the trial court\u2019s best interests analysis \u201cis based on\n additional factual findings besides the ones made in conjunction with the\n grounds for termination, the trial court must also include these findings in the\n written order.\u201d Id. Appellate courts \u201cmay not conduct de novo review of the\n termination decision in the absence of such findings.\u201d Id. (citing Adoption\n Place, Inc. v. Doe, 273 S.W.3d 142, 151 & n. 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)).\n Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i).\n -18-\n\f B. Standards of Appellate Review\n\nAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in\n termination proceedings using the standard of review in Tenn. R. App. P.\n 13(d). In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at\n 246. Under Rule 13(d), appellate courts review factual findings de novo on\n the record and accord these findings a presumption of correctness unless the\n evidence preponderates otherwise. In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596; In\n re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d 387, 393 (Tenn. 2009); In re Adoption of A.M.H., 215\n S.W.3d 793, 809 (Tenn. 2007). In light of the heightened burden of proof in\n termination proceedings, however, the reviewing court must make its own\n determination as to whether the facts, either as found by the trial court or as\n supported by a preponderance of the evidence, amount to clear and\n convincing evidence of the elements necessary to terminate parental rights.\n In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d at 596-97. The trial court\u2019s ruling that the\n evidence sufficiently supports termination of parental rights is a conclusion\n of law, which appellate courts review de novo with no presumption of\n correctness. In re M.L.P., 281 S.W.3d at 393 (quoting In re Adoption of\n A.M.H., 215 S.W.3d at 810). Additionally, all other questions of law in\n parental termination appeals, as in other appeals, are reviewed de novo with\n no presumption of correctness. In re Angela E., 303 S.W.3d at 246.\n\nIn re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507, 521-24 (Tenn. 2016) (footnotes in original but\nrenumbered). In conjunction with a best interest determination, clear and convincing\nevidence supporting any single ground will justify a termination order. E.g., In re\nValentine, 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002). Although Father does not challenge the\nground for termination found against him, we must review it anyway. In re Carrington H.,\n483 S.W.3d at 511 (\u201c[A]ppellate courts must review a trial court\u2019s findings regarding all\ngrounds for termination and whether termination is in a child\u2019s best interests, even if a\nparent fails to challenge these findings on appeal.\u201d).\n\nWe first address Mother\u2019s issues, beginning with whether the Juvenile Court erred\nin finding the ground of severe child abuse against her. On May 25, 2022, when DCS filed\nits petition, the ground of severe child abuse read as follows:\n\n(g) Initiation of termination of parental or guardianship rights may be based\n upon any of the grounds listed in this subsection (g). The following grounds\n are cumulative and nonexclusive, so that listing conditions, acts or omissions\n in one ground does not prevent them from coming within another ground:\n\n***\n -19-\n\f (4) The parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child\n abuse, as defined in \u00a7 37-1-102, under any prior order of a court or is found\n by the court hearing the petition to terminate parental rights or the petition\n for adoption to have committed severe child abuse against any child[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nAs relevant, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102 provides:\n\n(27) \u201cSevere child abuse\u201d means:\n (A)(i) The knowing exposure of a child to or the knowing failure to protect\n a child from abuse or neglect that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or\n death and the knowing use of force on a child that is likely to cause serious\n bodily injury or death;\n (ii) \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d shall have the same meaning given in \u00a7 39-15-\n 402(c)[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-102(b)(27)(A) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022). Regarding\nwhat \u201cknowing\u201d conduct consists of in the context of severe child abuse, our Supreme\nCourt has held:\n\n[F]or severe child abuse, a person\u2019s conduct is considered \u201cknowing,\u201d and a\n person is deemed to \u201cknowingly\u201d act or fail to act, when he actually knows\n of relevant facts, circumstances or information, or when he is either in\n deliberate ignorance of or in reckless disregard of such facts, circumstances,\n or information presented to him. Under this standard, the relevant facts,\n circumstances, or information would alert a reasonable parent to take\n affirmative action to protect the child. For deliberate ignorance, a parent can\n be found to have acted knowingly when he has specific reason to know the\n relevant facts, circumstances, or information but deliberately ignores them.\n For reckless disregard, if the parent has been presented with the relevant\n facts, circumstances, or information and recklessly disregards them, the\n parent\u2019s failure to protect can be considered knowing.\n\nIn re Markus E., 671 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Tenn. 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402 provides, as relevant:\n\n(c) \u201cSerious bodily injury to the child\u201d includes, but is not limited to, second-\n or third-degree burns, a fracture of any bone, a concussion, subdural or\n -20-\n\f subarachnoid bleeding, retinal hemorrhage, cerebral edema, brain contusion,\n injuries to the skin that involve severe bruising or the likelihood of permanent\n or protracted disfigurement, including those sustained by whipping children\n with objects and acts of female genital mutilation as defined in \u00a7 39-13-110.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-15-402(c) (West eff. July 1, 2019).\n\nMother challenges the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings that she committed severe child\nabuse. She asserts that, while the Juvenile Court focused on Kenna\u2019s risk for \u201crefeeding\nsyndrome,\u201d refeeding syndrome was not an abusive act by Mother but simply a result of\nincreasing caloric intake to a malnourished person. Mother argues further that there was\nno basis for the Juvenile Court\u2019s finding that Mother\u2019s striking Kenna with her fists or a\nbroom were likely to cause a broken nose or a concussion.\n\nThe Juvenile Court made detailed factual findings regarding Mother\u2019s abusive acts\ntoward Kenna. The evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s factual\nfindings. Furthermore, the Juvenile Court credited Kenna\u2019s testimony, including her\naccount of suffering at Mother\u2019s hands. We defer to a trial court\u2019s credibility determination\nabsent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Kelly v. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 692\n(Tenn. 2014). This record contains no clear and convincing evidence that would serve to\noverturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s credibility determinations regarding Kenna or any of the\nother witnesses.\n\nThe record reveals that Mother brutally abused Kenna by starving and beating her.\nMother\u2019s emphasis on refeeding syndrome misses the forest for the trees. Had Mother not\nstarved Kenna in the first place, Kenna would not have been at risk for refeeding syndrome.\nMother\u2019s abusive acts led to Kenna becoming gravely malnourished. This Court has\npreviously recognized malnourishment as a basis for sustaining the ground of severe child\nabuse. See In re Keara J., 376 S.W.3d 86, 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2012) (\u201c[W]e conclude that\nthe evidence overwhelmingly establishes Keara as a severely abused child who was\nsuffering the effects of knowing nutritional and physical neglect in her parents\u2019 care.\u201d).\nHere, Mother purposefully deprived Kenna of sufficient food, leading to Kenna becoming\nseverely emaciated. Dr. Wilt testified that Kenna\u2019s condition was such that she faced likely\nstarvation or death, had it continued. Had it not been for the intervention of law\nenforcement, Kenna might well have died of starvation thanks to Mother. Mother\u2019s\nstarvation of Kenna constituted severe child abuse under any definition of the term.\n\nMother also takes issue with the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings regarding her beatings of\nKenna. The Juvenile Court found that, while Kenna had not suffered any broken bones or\na concussion, \u201cbeing struck in the head by [Mother] with her fists and a broom was likely\nto cause a broken nose or concussion.\u201d Mother contends that this finding has no basis. We\n -21-\n\fdisagree. The Juvenile Court\u2019s findings reflect the common sense understanding that an\nadult repeatedly striking a child in the face with fists and/or various hard objects is likely\nto cause that child to have a broken nose or concussion. Mother\u2019s actions toward Kenna\nwent far beyond any legitimate discipline and fell squarely into the statutory definition of\nacts likely to cause serious bodily injury.\n\nAs a final point on this issue, Mother argues strenuously that since Kenna was not\nher child, she should not be held to the duties of a parent or guardian. Mother\u2019s argument\nis without merit. The ground for parental rights at issue, (g)(4), provides for termination\nwhen \u201c[t]he parent or guardian has been found to have committed severe child abuse . . .\nagainst any child[.]\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(g)(4) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30,\n2022) (emphasis added). Thus, it does not matter that Kenna was not Mother\u2019s child. The\nGeneral Assembly has decided that inflicting severe abuse on any child, not only one\u2019s\nbiological or legal child, will sustain the ground of severe child abuse. We find, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that the ground of severe child abuse was proven against Mother by clear\nand convincing evidence.\n\nWe next address whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. On May 25, 2022, when DCS\nfiled its petition, the best interest factors read as follows:\n\n(i)(1) In determining whether termination of parental or guardianship rights\n is in the best interest of the child, the court shall consider all relevant and\n child-centered factors applicable to the particular case before the court.\n Those factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n (A) The effect a termination of parental rights will have on the child\u2019s critical\n need for stability and continuity of placement throughout the child\u2019s\n minority;\n (B) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to\n have on the child\u2019s emotional, psychological, and medical condition;\n (C) Whether the parent has demonstrated continuity and stability in meeting\n the child\u2019s basic material, educational, housing, and safety needs;\n (D) Whether the parent and child have a secure and healthy parental\n attachment, and if not, whether there is a reasonable expectation that the\n parent can create such attachment;\n (E) Whether the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact with\n the child and used the visitation or other contact to cultivate a positive\n relationship with the child;\n (F) Whether the child is fearful of living in the parent\u2019s home;\n\n-22-\n\f(G) Whether the parent, parent\u2019s home, or others in the parent\u2019s household\ntrigger or exacerbate the child\u2019s experience of trauma or post-traumatic\nsymptoms;\n(H) Whether the child has created a healthy parental attachment with another\nperson or persons in the absence of the parent;\n(I) Whether the child has emotionally significant relationships with persons\nother than parents and caregivers, including biological or foster siblings, and\nthe likely impact of various available outcomes on these relationships and\nthe child\u2019s access to information about the child\u2019s heritage;\n(J) Whether the parent has demonstrated such a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it safe and beneficial for the\nchild to be in the home of the parent, including consideration of whether there\nis criminal activity in the home or by the parent, or the use of alcohol,\ncontrolled substances, or controlled substance analogues which may render\nthe parent unable to consistently care for the child in a safe and stable\nmanner;\n(K) Whether the parent has taken advantage of available programs, services,\nor community resources to assist in making a lasting adjustment of\ncircumstances, conduct, or conditions;\n(L) Whether the department has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent\nin making a lasting adjustment in cases where the child is in the custody of\nthe department;\n(M) Whether the parent has demonstrated a sense of urgency in establishing\npaternity of the child, seeking custody of the child, or addressing the\ncircumstance, conduct, or conditions that made an award of custody unsafe\nand not in the child\u2019s best interest;\n(N) Whether the parent, or other person residing with or frequenting the\nhome of the parent, has shown brutality or physical, sexual, emotional, or\npsychological abuse or neglect toward the child or any other child or adult;\n(O) Whether the parent has ever provided safe and stable care for the child\nor any other child;\n(P) Whether the parent has demonstrated an understanding of the basic and\nspecific needs required for the child to thrive;\n(Q) Whether the parent has demonstrated the ability and commitment to\ncreating and maintaining a home that meets the child\u2019s basic and specific\nneeds and in which the child can thrive;\n(R) Whether the physical environment of the parent\u2019s home is healthy and\nsafe for the child;\n(S) Whether the parent has consistently provided more than token financial\nsupport for the child; and\n\n-23-\n\f (T) Whether the mental or emotional fitness of the parent would be\n detrimental to the child or prevent the parent from consistently and\n effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision of the child.\n (2) When considering the factors set forth in subdivision (i)(1), the prompt\n and permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is presumed to\n be in the child\u2019s best interest.\n (3) All factors considered by the court to be applicable to a particular case\n must be identified and supported by specific findings of fact in the court\u2019s\n written order.\n (4) Expert testimony is not required to prove or disprove any factor by any\n party.\n (5) As used in this subsection (i), \u201cparent\u201d includes guardian.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-113(i) (West July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).\n\nMother argues that the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest analysis. According\nto Mother, she \u201chas not had a meaningful opportunity to meet the needs of her children in\nmore than two and a half years\u201d because DCS took the Children from her. Mother says it\nwas wrong for the Juvenile Court to hold this separation against her because it presumes\nthat she did what she was accused of doing. Mother also points out that, despite Kenna\u2019s\ncondition, the Children appeared to have been properly fed and were not bruised. In\nessence, Mother argues that, regardless of what she may have done to Kenna, the Children\nwere fine in her care. Mother also says that the Juvenile Court wrongly held her decision\nnot to testify against her.\n\nImplicit to Mother\u2019s argument is that she merely is alleged to have abused Kenna.\nHowever, a bench trial has been held in this matter. The Juvenile Court found that Mother\ncommitted severe child abuse against Kenna based upon its findings that Mother starved\nand beat Kenna. We have found nothing in the record to overturn the Juvenile Court\u2019s\nfactual findings. On the contrary, the record fully supports the Juvenile Court\u2019s findings.\nMother\u2019s abuse of Kenna no longer is a mere allegation\u2014it is an adjudicated fact. It was\nMother\u2019s abusive actions that led to the Children\u2019s removal and her separation from them.\nMother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take responsibility for it, is the\nweightiest factor in this matter. Regarding Mother\u2019s argument that the Children appeared\nnormal despite Kenna\u2019s condition, that is both insufficient and misleading. The Children\nwere in the same household where Mother\u2019s brutality and violence against Kenna unfolded.\nAnnabelle and Jasmine required therapy and fell behind educationally. While the Children\nmay not have been subjected to the same horrors that Mother inflicted on Kenna, they were\nnevertheless exposed to a climate of abuse and fear. Thus, it is inaccurate to suggest that\nthe Children somehow led normal lives notwithstanding what Mother did to Kenna. It was\nappropriate for the Juvenile Court to consider Mother\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna in\n -24-\n\fconcluding that the Children were at risk of facing similar abuse should they be returned\nto Mother\u2019s care. There is no hint that Mother understands the severity of what she did to\nKenna or even that what she did to Kenna was wrong. Finally, regarding Mother\u2019s\nassertion that the Juvenile Court held her refusal to testify against her, we find that not to\nbe the case. The Juvenile Court did not punish Mother for declining to testify. It merely\nnoted that Mother could have shed more light on certain factors had she chosen to testify.\nThat was a correct observation by the Juvenile Court. Mother chose not to testify, and the\nJuvenile Court was by necessity limited to the evidence adduced from other sources. In\nsum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as to each applicable best interest factor.\nThe evidence does not preponderate against the Juvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We\nfind by clear and convincing evidence, as did the Juvenile Court, that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interest. We affirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s\njudgment terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights to the Children.\n\nWe next address Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam. Father does not contest the ground\nof severe child abuse found against him. All the same, under our Supreme Court\u2019s holding\nin In re Carrington H., we are required to address it. The Juvenile Court made detailed\nfindings regarding Father\u2019s role in the severe abuse suffered by Kenna. Father stood by\nwhile his daughter was starved and suffered beatings at Mother\u2019s hands. Father even\npointed a gun at Kenna on occasion. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground of\nsevere child abuse was proven against Father by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThe final issue we address is whether the Juvenile Court erred in finding that\ntermination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. On this issue, Father\nmakes several contentions as to why he believes the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest\nanalysis. Father states that he has appropriate housing; that he is employed; that he\ncompleted a parenting assessment; that he completed an alcohol and drug program; that his\nvisits with Liam were appropriate; that he has completed the tasks required of him; and\nthat Liam liked seeing him on visits. According to Father, the Juvenile Court did not give\nenough weight to these positives in its analysis.\n\nFather is correct in that he did certain positive things during the custodial period.\nThe Juvenile Court recognized as much in its order. For example, the Juvenile Court found\nthat the factor concerning visitation weighed against terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to\nLiam. The record reflects that Liam was happy to see Father on visits. By the same\nmeasure, however, the record reflects that Liam is happy in general. In any event, the\nJuvenile Court did not utterly discount Father\u2019s positive acts. Even still, hinging upon \u201cthe\ncircumstances of a particular child and a particular parent, the consideration of one factor\nmay very well dictate the outcome of the analysis.\u201d In re Gabriella D., 531 S.W.3d 662,\n682 (Tenn. 2017) (quoting In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d 838, 878 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).\n -25-\n\fUnder the circumstances of this case, severe child abuse is the paramount concern. Father\nstood by while his daughter Kenna was starved and beaten by Mother. Father even\ncontributed to the abuse by pointing a gun at Kenna on occasion. There is no hint that\nFather has ever taken responsibility for the brutality Kenna endured. Instead, Father\nblamed Kenna. Father\u2019s severe abuse of Kenna, and subsequent failure to take\nresponsibility for it, outweighs his positive actions and poses the real risk that Liam could\nsuffer similar abuse in Father\u2019s care. In sum, the Juvenile Court made detailed findings as\nto each applicable best interest factor. The evidence does not preponderate against the\nJuvenile Court\u2019s detailed findings. We find by clear and convincing evidence, as did the\nJuvenile Court, that termination of Father\u2019s parental rights is in Liam\u2019s best interest. We\naffirm the Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to Liam.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe judgment of the Juvenile Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the\nJuvenile Court for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed 50% to\nthe Appellant, Rikiya P., and 50% to the Appellant, Daniel R., and their surety, if any.\n\n____________________________________\n D.

The circuit court found that it was timely accepted and that a\n\nbinding settlement agreement was formed. Over the wife\u2019s objection, the court entered a\n\njudgment for absolute divorce based on mutual consent. The court incorporated (but did\n\nnot merge) the settlement agreement into the judgment. The Appellate Court of Maryland\n\ndisagreed and reversed the judgment of the circuit court. We affirm the judgment of the\n\nAppellate Court.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nThis contested divorce case was commenced by Petitioner Todd Pattison\n\n(\u201cHusband\u201d) on May 24, 2019, when he filed a complaint for an absolute divorce against\n\nRespondent Deborah Pattison (\u201cWife\u201d), who filed a counterclaim the following month. The\n\nparties alleged various grounds for divorce, none of which are relevant here.\n\nTrial was scheduled to begin on October 5, 2020. On September 16, 2020, over\n\nWife\u2019s objection, the court postponed the trial until March 2021. Two days later, the parties\n\nattended a pretrial/settlement conference at which they spent approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a retired judge. No settlement was reached.\n\nOn Friday, September 25, 2020, Wife\u2019s counsel sent a hand-delivered settlement\n\npackage to Husband\u2019s counsel containing a Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement\n\nAgreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), bearing Wife\u2019s signature. Among other terms, the\n\nAgreement provided that, \u201c[i]n order to balance the equities of the parties in and to their\n\nproperties, Husband shall pay to Wife a monetary award . . . in the amount of $760,000.00\n\fto be paid\u201d in six installments over two and one-half years. To secure this obligation, the\n\nAgreement required Husband to execute a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d), attached as\n\nExhibit A to the Agreement. The Agreement also stated that Husband\u2019s business and living\n\ntrust \u201cshall guarantee payment of this monetary award obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an\n\nunconditional guaranty (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d) was included in the settlement package.\n\nThe cover letter with the proposed Agreement stated:\n\nEnclosed please find two (2) signed, initialed and notarized originals\n of the Pattison Marital Settlement Agreement for counter-execution by your\n client. A redlined copy of the pages of the Agreement depicting my revisions\n to the version which you sent to me yesterday is also attached; note that non-\n substantive changes were also made at pages 5, 6 and 8 in addition to the\n \u201crepairs\u201d language on pages 3-4. Further note that changes to page 8 were\n made in order to reflect the fact that there is a Note to be paid according to\n its terms and that the Guarantors will not be signing the Note itself.\n\nAlso enclosed is the final version of the Promissory Note (Ex. A) and\n the form of the Guaranty which has been approved by [Wife].\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nHusband received the settlement package by email that same day, but signed the\n\ndocuments the following Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, Husband filed an amended complaint seeking an absolute\n\ndivorce based on mutual consent. See MD. CODE ANN., FAM. LAW (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 7-103(a)(3)\n\n(2019 Repl. Vol.). Among other things, Husband alleged that he and Wife entered into the\n\fAgreement. He requested that the court incorporate but not merge the Agreement into a\n\njudgment of absolute divorce.\n\nWife timely answered the amended complaint on October 12, 2020, alleging that\n\nHusband failed to timely accept her settlement offer and that, therefore, the Agreement was\n\na nullity.\n\nHusband moved to enforce the settlement agreement on October 16, 2020. The court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on March 16, 2021. Husband and Wife both testified. The\n\ncircuit court granted Husband\u2019s motion. The court recognized that settlement agreements\n\nare contracts, and that mutual assent is an \u201cessential prerequisite to the creation or\n\nformation of a contract.\u201d The court then analyzed the language of the Agreement and\n\nconcluded that its plain terms were definite and reflected the parties\u2019 intent to be bound.\n\nThe court rejected Wife\u2019s argument that her offer was conditioned on Husband\n\nsigning the Agreement on September 25, 2020. The court acknowledged that the cover\n\nletter contained language \u201cindicating\u201d a condition that Husband needed to sign the\n\nAgreement on September 25, 2020, but that Husband \u201cdenie[d]\u201d that the letter imposed a\n\n\u201chard deadline, and point[ed] to language\u201d in the letter \u201cindicating an expectation that the\n\nagreement would be finalized by the following week.\u201d The court weighed the credibility\n\nof the witnesses and concluded that Wife\u2019s offer did not include \u201ca definite time expiration\n\nof September 25th, 2020.\u201d The court stated that even if it did, \u201ccontract formation still\n\nwould have occurred through the action of the parties.\u201d The court did not explain the factual\n\nbasis for that finding, but instead proceeded to find that even if Wife had imposed a hard\n\ndeadline, she waived it.\n\f To that end, the court stated that \u201cthe evidence presented at the hearing indicated\n\nthat counsel was in communication throughout the day and the parties were being updated\n\nby their respective counsel.\u201d The court reasoned:\n\nAt some point on the 25th [Husband] indicated through counsel that\n he would not be able to sign the agreement until Monday.\n There is no evidence presented to indicate that [Wife] rejected\n [Husband]\u2019s offer to sign the agreement on Monday, the 28th, rather than\n Friday. In fact, the evidence indicates a willingness to accept the separation\n [agreement] from [Husband] on Monday.\n As a result, [Husband] signed and returned the separation agreement\n on September 28th, 2020.\n Importantly, the first time the issue of untimeliness was raised by\n [Wife] was when she filed her answer to the amended complaint 17 days\n later. [Wife]\u2019s failure to raise the issue until 17 days after [Husband] accepted\n her offer constitutes a waiver of the requirement to sign the separation\n agreement on the 25th.\n\nCiting section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, 1 the court stated:\n\nan offeror who has imposed a time limit in its offer does not in fact insist\n upon it, and by further negotiations the offeror may indicate a continued\n willingness to stand by the terms of its offer. Any such manifestation of\n continued willingness on the part of the offeror will extend the time during\n which acceptance may occur, constituting in effect a new offer which may\n be accepted, and if so accepted, will ripen into a contract.\n\nSee 1 Samuel Williston & Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 5:5 (4th\n\ned.).\n\nFrom there, the court determined that it was \u201cnot persuaded that [Wife] was\n\nunwilling to extend the time during which acceptance [could] occur after learning that\n The circuit court cited to section 5:5 of Williston on Contracts, \u201cLapse by\nexpiration of time stated in offer.\u201d In the May 2025 updated version of Williston on\nContracts, that passage is found in section 5:7.\n\f[Husband] was unable to perform\u201d on September 25. Thus, the court found \u201cthat mutual\n\nconsent of the parties to form a contract, namely the [Agreement], ha[d] occurred.\u201d\n\nB\n\nWife noted an appeal. The Appellate Court of Maryland dismissed her appeal\n\nbecause no final judgment had been entered. Pattison v. Pattison, 254 Md. App. 294\n\n(2022).\n\nOn remand, the court granted Husband an absolute divorce by mutual consent and\n\nincorporated but did not merge the Agreement into the divorce decree.\n\nWife appealed again, and in a reported opinion, the Appellate Court reversed.\n\nPattison v. Pattison, 262 Md. App. 504 (2024). The court found that no contract was\n\nformed because Husband failed to execute the Agreement by the end of the day on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, as required by Wife\u2019s explicitly stated condition. Id. at 529, 534-35.\n\nThe court also found no evidence supporting the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Wife had\n\nwaived this condition. Id. at 534.\n\nWe granted Husband\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. Pattison v. Pattison, 489 Md.\n\n243 (2024).\n\nII\n\nA\n\nHusband contends that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement because Wife signed the document on September 25, 2020, and he signed it on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020. He argues that Wife accepted the terms of the Agreement through her\n\nsignature, and that her condition for same-day execution was not part of the Agreement but\n\fwas rather an extrinsic attempt to change its terms. To that end, Husband argues that the\n\nintegration clause in the Agreement\u2014which states that the document contains the entire\n\nunderstanding of the parties\u2014precludes consideration of the condition in the cover letter.\n\nTo support his position, Husband points to his testimony at the hearing that he did\n\nnot interpret the cover letter as imposing a hard deadline of September 25. Husband\n\ntestified: \u201cMy interpretation was [Wife\u2019s counsel] needed all the executed documents by\n\nMonday, because without the personal guarant[y] and the promissory note the settlement\n\nagreement is unenforceable.\u201d\n\nHusband argues that even if the cover letter imposed an acceptance deadline, it was\n\nan unreasonable condition. According to Husband, that\u2019s because the parties\u2019 attorneys\n\ncommunicated on the morning of September 25, and Wife\u2019s counsel knew that nobody\n\nwould be at Husband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office to accept delivery of the settlement package. He\n\nargues that the email with the settlement package was not received by his counsel until\n\n3:51 p.m., \u201cjust over an hour from the close of the business day.\u201d Husband contends that\n\nhe did not receive the original package until September 28. Relying on Canaras v. Lift\n\nTruck Services, Inc., 272 Md. 337 (1974), Husband argues that \u201c[w]hether a provision in a\n\ncontract is a condition the nonfulfillment of which excuses performance depends upon the\n\nintent of the parties to be ascertained from a fair and reasonable construction of the\n\nlanguage used in light of all the surrounding circumstance[s] when they executed the\n\ncontract.\u201d\n\nHusband also relies on section 41 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts for the\n\nproposition that whether an offer is accepted within a reasonable amount of time \u201cis a\n\fquestion of fact[,] depending on all the circumstances existing when the offer and attempted\n\nacceptance are made.\u201d And he argues that he \u201cacted as quickly and as reasonably under\n\nthe facts and circumstances of this case as he could\u201d to fully execute the settlement\n\ndocuments.\n\nFinally, Husband contends that even if Wife imposed a September 25 deadline for\n\nacceptance, she waived it. According to Husband, Wife never communicated her rejection\n\nof the Agreement until she responded to his motion to enforce the Agreement. And, he\n\nmaintains, the circuit court determined that Wife knew Husband could not sign the\n\ndocuments until Monday and that Husband\u2019s counsel was not in his office to accept their\n\ndelivery. Thus, he argues, the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in finding that\n\nWife \u201cwaived strict compliance with her attempted condition[.]\u201d\n\nB\n\nProperty settlement agreements are analyzed under the same principles as other\n\ncontracts. Bruce v. Dyer, 309 Md. 421, 439 (1987). 2 Mutual assent is a prerequisite to the\n In a divorce proceeding, one of the benefits of entering into a property settlement\nagreement is that it provides a basis to obtain a divorce on an expedited basis based on\nmutual consent. But to do that, the parties must put their agreement in writing and submit\nit to the court, which in turn must make a finding that the best interests of the parties\u2019 minor\nchildren, if any, are served by the agreement. FL \u00a7 7-103(a)(3). There is no dispute that\nHusband and Wife intended to put in writing any agreement they reached so that they could\nproceed with a divorce on that basis. This is important because the dissent seems to think\nthat because Wife and Husband, through their counsel, negotiated and agreed upon the\nvarious terms of the Agreement in the days and hours leading up to Wife signing the\nAgreement, there was no going back\u2014that those terms were final and binding before either\nparty even signed the Agreement. To the contrary, it is clear from the testimony that neither\nparty intended to be bound until the Agreement was finalized and signed, and neither party\nargued to the contrary in this Court.\n\fformation of a contract, which means that the contract terms are definite and that the parties\n\nintend to be bound by them. Cochran v. Norkunas, 398 Md. 1, 14 (2007). And \u201cthe\n\nacceptance of the other party must correspond with the offer in its entirety.\u201d Peoples Drug\n\nStores v. Fenton Realty Corp., 191 Md. 489, 494 (1948). Here, neither party contends that\n\nthe proposed Agreement\u2019s terms were not certain or definite. And both parties agree that\n\nWife was the offeror. The sole issue is whether there was an offer and acceptance, without\n\nwhich there can be no mutual assent.\n\nAn offer can come with or without conditions. As this Court stated 92 years ago:\n\nSince the offeror was at liberty to make no offer, it was free to determine and\n impose whatever terms it might choose, and among these it might require\n that its offer be accepted within a designated time in a specific manner. If no\n acceptance is made in the manner and within the period fixed by the offer,\n the offer necessarily expires. Williston on Contracts, secs. 53, 61, 76; Van\n Camp Packing Co. v. Smith, 101 Md. 565, 61 A. 284.\n\nAm. Med. Spirits Co. v. Mayor & City Council of Balt., 165 Md. 128, 133 (1933). This\n\ntime-tested rule makes sense: Contracts are voluntary undertakings; thus, it\u2019s not the\n\ncourt\u2019s place to pass judgment on the wisdom, necessity, or fairness of the conditions an\n\nofferor attaches to her offer. Perhaps Wife had her reasons; perhaps not. Legally, it doesn\u2019t\n\nmatter.\n\nNor does it matter what Husband thought the cover letter meant. An offer is\n\ninterpreted based on \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have\n\nthought it meant.\u201d Ray v. Eurice & Bros., Inc., 201 Md. 115, 127 (1952) (quoting 1 Samuel\n\nWilliston & George J. Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 94 (2d ed.)). As\n\nwe explained 73 years ago:\n\f Williston . . . states the rule as follows: \u201cThe only intent of the parties to a\n contract which is essential[] is an intent to say the words and do the acts\n which constitute their manifestation[s] of assent.\u201d\n\nId. at 127 (quoting 1 Williston & Thompson, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 21). 3\n\nHere, there was no ambiguity in the September 25 signature deadline; thus, its\n\ninterpretation is a matter of law that we review without deference. See Adventist\n\nHealthcare, Inc. v. Behram, 488 Md. 410, 432 (2024) (\u201cThe interpretation of a contract,\n\nincluding the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law\n\nreviewed without deference.\u201d). Whether the letter imposed a hard signature deadline does\n\nnot hinge on the credibility of the parties\u2019 respective testimony. What matters is what the\n\ncover letter said and the legal effect of its words.\n\nThe cover letter stated:\n\nThis Agreement is delivered to you in settlement of the parties\u2019\n outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed\n by [Husband] today. I will assume that we will have the final Guaranty signed\n by [Husband] by close of business on Monday.\n\nPlease advise me via text or e-mail when [Husband] has counter-\n executed the Agreement and Note. Thank you.\n\nAlthough the letter was not admitted into evidence, the contents of the entire first\n\nparagraph above were elicited verbatim and confirmed by both Husband and Wife in their\n\ntestimony. The letter expressly distinguishes between the Agreement and Note, which had\n\nto be signed on September 25, and the Guaranty, which could be signed on September 28.\n\nThus, any reasonable person in the parties\u2019 positions would understand that Wife\u2019s offer\n See footnote 4 for an explanation of the legal effect of the words used to express\nan offer.\n\fwas conditioned on Husband signing the Agreement and Note on September 25.\n\nConversely, no reasonable person would perceive any flexibility in that deadline.\n\nC\n\nThat Wife imposed the condition in the cover letter and not within the four corners\n\nof the Agreement is also irrelevant. \u201cIt is hornbook law that an offer of no specified\n\nduration must be accepted within a time reasonable under the circumstances or the offer\n\nwill lapse and a subsequent attempt to accept will be of no effect.\u201d Barnes v. Euster, 240\n\nMd. 603, 607 (1965). It is equally true that \u201can offer that has been extended, but not yet\n\naccepted, generally can be withdrawn by the offeror.\u201d Hall v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty.\n\nDemocratic Cent. Comm., 431 Md. 108, 131 (2013); see also Lemlich v. Bd. of Trs. of\n\nHarford Cmty. Coll., 282 Md. 495, 502 (1978) (\u201cIt is so basic a contract principle that\n\nminimal supporting authority is needed to authorize the statement that there must exist an\n\noffer by one party and an unconditional acceptance of that precise offer by the other, prior\n\nto withdrawal by the offeror, before a binding agreement is born.\u201d); Coleman v.\n\nApplegarth, 68 Md. 21, 29 (1887).\n\nThe withdrawal of a condition can be communicated in various ways, including\n\nthrough written communication. See Pavel Enters., Inc. v. A.S. Johnson Co., Inc., 342 Md.\n\n143, 163 (1996) (finding that the offer was withdrawn by the offeror by a letter to the\n\nofferee expressing an intent to withdraw); James L. Kernan Co. v. Cook, 162 Md. 137, 143\n\n(1932) (finding that an offer had been revoked via a letter from the offeror). Obviously, no\n\nmatter how the offeror communicates a withdrawal, one thing is certain: a withdrawal\n\nwould never be contained in the proposed contract; that is, an offeror cannot\n\fsimultaneously extend and withdraw an offer. So even if Wife had not imposed any\n\ncondition in her cover letter, and so long as Husband had not already accepted it, she could\n\nhave withdrawn the offer in a separate letter at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, September 26, or\n\nat any other time of her choosing. The only difference here is that Wife communicated the\n\nexpiration of the offer in advance, when she conveyed the offer. Basic logic dictates that if\n\nthe withdrawal of an offer can be (and always is) communicated outside of the proposed\n\ncontract after the offer is made, so too can a deadline for accepting an offer when the offer\n\nis made.\n\nD\n\nWe turn now to Husband\u2019s contention that Wife waived compliance with the\n\nSeptember 25 signature deadline. Waiver is \u201cthe intentional relinquishment of a known\n\nright.\u201d Taylor v. Mandel, 402 Md. 109, 135 (2007). Waiver must be clearly communicated\n\nor implied from the circumstances. See Myers v. Kayhoe, 391 Md. 188, 205 (2006) (stating\n\nthat waiver \u201cmust be clearly established and will not be inferred from equivocal acts or\n\nlanguage\u201d); Canaras, 272 Md. at 360-61 (stating that for waiver to be established through\n\nimplication or mutual understanding, there must be evidence of a party\u2019s conduct\n\ndemonstrating relinquishment of a right).\n\nHusband leans heavily on his contention that the circuit court found that Wife knew\n\nHusband could not sign the documents until Monday and that Wife knew Husband\u2019s\n\ncounsel was not at the office to take delivery of the settlement package. Even if those facts\n\nwere true, it would not matter. An offeror\u2019s freedom to impose any conditions on her offer\n\nis not constrained by the offeree\u2019s ability, or lack thereof, to satisfy those conditions.\n\f Wife\u2019s silence after receiving the documents from Husband on September 28\n\nlikewise did not constitute a waiver. When Husband signed the documents on September\n\n28, Wife\u2019s offer had already expired, see Am. Med. Spirits Co., 165 Md. at 133, and thus,\n\nthere was no offer for Husband to accept. As a matter of law, when Husband delivered the\n\nsigned documents to Wife (through counsel) on September 28, Husband made his own\n\noffer\u2014some would call it a counteroffer\u2014to Wife. That counteroffer put the power of\n\nacceptance in Wife\u2019s hands, as the new offeree. Wife had no duty to respond to Husband\u2019s\n\ncounteroffer, and there is no evidence that she did respond, either in words or in deeds,\n\nuntil she timely filed her answer to Husband\u2019s amended complaint, in which she\n\nunambiguously disputed the validity of the Agreement.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that silence can never amount to an acceptance. Acceptance\n\nthrough silence can occur if: (1) the parties agreed to that effect in advance, (2) there was\n\na prior course of dealings that indicated such an understanding, or (3) the offeree accepts\n\nany benefits of the agreement. See id. But there is no evidence to support any of those\n\nexceptions here. Thus, Wife\u2019s mere silence, without more, was not an acceptance of\n\nHusband\u2019s offer. See Cochran, 398 Md. at 23-24.\n\nE\n\nHusband argues that the circuit court improperly excluded evidence of the parties\u2019\n\ncommunications in the days and hours leading up to the hand delivery of the Agreement to\n\nHusband\u2019s counsel\u2019s office. As he did before the Appellate Court, Husband argues that, at\n\na minimum, we should remand the matter for the circuit court to consider those exhibits.\n\nWe have considered all the exhibits in the record, and we determine that, as a matter of\n\flaw, no contract was formed due to Husband\u2019s failure to adhere to Wife\u2019s deadline, and\n\nthat the evidence, including the excluded exhibits, does not support the circuit court\u2019s\n\nwaiver finding.\n\nThose emails, had they been admitted, would have established the following:\n\n\u2022 September 24 at 9:37 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel responded to Husband\u2019s proposals\n regarding personal property and financial responsibility for home repairs. Wife\u2019s\n counsel closed the email saying: \u201cIf this is acceptable, I will include your\n revisions in the Agreement, add the repair language above, and have [Wife] sign\n the Agreement for your client\u2019s counter-signing.\u201d Thus, Husband was on notice\n to expect the signed documents from Wife that same day.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 8:16 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel emailed to Wife\u2019s counsel a draft\n of the Guaranty with both counsel\u2019s and Husband\u2019s corporate counsel\u2019s\n comments and edits. Husband\u2019s counsel advised that \u201c[Husband\u2019s corporate\n counsel] has not addressed some things still.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:17 a.m.: Referring to the Guaranty, Wife\u2019s counsel asked\n Husband\u2019s counsel: \u201cWhen can we expect [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\u2019s final\n comments? If not done this morning, I suppose this will have to be done next\n week sometime.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:40 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cWe can execute the\n other documents today though. I have no problem with that. The Guaranty is\n agreed.\u201d Thus, it was Husband\u2019s counsel, not Wife\u2019s counsel, who planted the\n idea that Husband would sign the Agreement and Note, but not the Guaranty,\n that same day. Husband\u2019s counsel never retracted that suggestion.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 10:52 a.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel proposed revised language\n regarding the repairs to the marital home before it could be sold and told\n Husband\u2019s counsel that Husband\u2019s proposed changes to the Guaranty were\n accepted \u201cexcept for the striking of the attorneys[\u2019] fees provision. My partner\n has included the same 10% attorneys[\u2019] fees provision as is in the Promissory\n Note.\u201d The email closed with: \u201cIf these changes are accepted, we can finish up.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 11:04 a.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI sent this to [Husband].\u201d\n And referring to the proposed changes to the home repair provisions, Husband\u2019s\n counsel said, \u201cI am fine with it as long as it is clear it is an exception to the\n\f general language that [Husband] is solely responsible for upkeep of the house\n and bills.\u201d\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 1:59 p.m.: Wife\u2019s counsel attached a revised Guaranty\n reflecting the change to the attorneys\u2019 fees provision mentioned in the prior\n email, and informed Husband\u2019s counsel that: \u201cthe signed and notarized\n Agreement, the Note and Guaranty will be delivered to your office in the next\n half hour. The [cover] letter is attached to this e-mail as well.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s\n counsel was informed about the signature deadline in the early afternoon of\n September 25. And Husband testified that he saw that email and was aware that\n the signed Agreement and Note would be delivered to his counsel\u2019s office.\n Husband testified that he received the cover letter attached to that email.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:31 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\n is there.\u201d This was when Wife\u2019s counsel first learned that Husband\u2019s counsel\n was not in his office.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 2:39 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel told Wife\u2019s counsel that he asked\n Husband\u2019s corporate counsel to expedite his review of the Guaranty and stated:\n \u201cIf it needs to be edited at all I will let you know.\u201d Husband\u2019s counsel added:\n \u201cFortunately [Husband] was ok with the principle regarding the house repairs as\n you set forth in your earlier email. I do need to review myself and if I have any\n tweak[s] I will let you know.\u201d Thus, Husband was engaged in the settlement\n process on September 25, notwithstanding his illness.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:27 p.m.: Husband\u2019s counsel wrote to Wife\u2019s counsel: \u201cI know\n you are out, and am sorry to bother. But could you have someone send me via\n email the version of the Separation Agreement you had her sing [sic] and sent to\n my office please. I am not there at all today.\u201d Thus, Husband\u2019s counsel\n appreciated the importance of getting the documents to Husband for his\n signature that day, as opposed to waiting for the following Monday.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:57 p.m.: Responding to Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s 1:59 p.m. email,\n Husband\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cThis should be fine. [Husband\u2019s corporate counsel]\n had no more additions.\u201d Again, no mention of any concern with the signature\n deadline.\n\n\u2022 September 25 at 3:51 p.m.: Someone from Wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s office emailed the\n settlement agreement package to Husband\u2019s counsel as requested in the latter\u2019s\n email at 3:27 p.m.\n\f These emails would have provided no support for the circuit court\u2019s finding that\n\nHusband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer or that Wife waived the signature deadline. Thus,\n\nwe agree with the Appellate Court that a remand for that purpose is unnecessary. 4\n\nJUDGMENT OF THE APPELLATE\n COURT OF MARYLAND\n We respectfully disagree with the analysis of our dissenting colleagues. This case\nis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about whether the Agreement constituted a\nbinding contract under basic principles of offer and acceptance. The dissent\u2019s reliance on\nthe terms of the Agreement, including the provisions confirming the voluntariness of the\nparties\u2019 signatures, the effective date of September 25, 2020, the integration clause, and\nothers, are misplaced. For the same reason, so too is the dissent\u2019s reliance on the parol\nevidence rule. Had Husband timely accepted Wife\u2019s offer, all the terms of the Agreement\nwould have been binding, and parol evidence would not have been permitted to vary them.\n The dissent contends that we should attribute no significance to the cover letter\nbecause it was excluded as hearsay. But the dissent overlooks that both parties, in their\ntestimony, testified about and confirmed the cover letter\u2019s contents verbatim, and without\nobjection. So even if the substance of the cover letter constituted hearsay, any objection on\nthat basis was waived, as its contents were in evidence and undisputed. Thus, the existence\nof the September 25th deadline for the execution of the Agreement did not hinge on\nanyone\u2019s credibility.\n The dissent\u2019s focus on the hearsay issue underscores a broader misunderstanding of\nthe legal import of the cover letter and the evidentiary purpose it served. \u201c\u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). The\ncontents of the cover letter were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather\nfor the legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter\nwith such contents constituted an act with independent legal significance. See State v.\nYoung, 462 Md. 159, 175 (2018).\n Such acts include the making and acceptance of an offer. Garner v. State, 414 Md.\n372, 382 (2010). For example, if a person were to say to a car owner \u201cI offer you $200 for\nyour car and the offer expires in 15 minutes,\u201d that statement would be admissible for the\nlegal effect of uttering those words, which are twofold: (1) the person offered to buy the\ncar for $200 and put the power of acceptance in the owner\u2019s hands; and (2) the owner\u2019s\npower of acceptance expires in 15 minutes. If the owner wasn\u2019t listening and did not learn\nabout the offer until after it expired (perhaps when the person later said to the owner that\nthe person was surprised that the owner didn\u2019t accept it), as a matter of law, this would not\nmatter. Nor would it matter that the owner never agreed to the unilateral deadline. As the\nofferor, the person had the unfettered unilateral right to dictate the terms of the offer and\nany acceptance deadline. The same principles apply here.\n\f AFFIRMED.

PATTISON\n\nv.\n\nDEBORAH PATTISON\n\n______________________________________\n\nFader, C.J.,\n Watts,\n Booth,\n Biran,\n Gould,\n Eaves,\n Killough,\n\nJJ.\n ______________________________________\n\nDissenting Opinion by Killough, J., which\n Eaves, J., joins.\n ______________________________________\n\nFiled: July 23, 2025\n\f I respectfully dissent from the Majority\u2019s opinion reversing the trial court\u2019s\n\nenforcement of the marital settlement agreement in this case. In my view, the Majority\u2019s\n\nframing of the case through an \u201coffer and acceptance\u201d construct is misplaced. The parties\n\nhad already negotiated and agreed to all material terms of a settlement, reduced that\n\nagreement to writing, and Respondent (referred to herein as \u201cWife\u201d or \u201cMs. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned, initialed, and notarized the agreement. Her signature reflected her unequivocal\n\nassent to be bound. When Petitioner (referred to herein as \u201cHusband\u201d or \u201cMr. Pattison\u201d)\n\nsigned the agreement on September 28, 2020, there was no open offer left to accept or\n\nreject \u2013 only a binding agreement to be enforced.\n\nThe Majority cites no case \u2013 and I am aware of none \u2013 in which a court has set aside\n\na fully executed, integrated agreement based solely on a purported condition precedent\n\nfound in an extrinsic document. Yet that is precisely the result the Majority reaches.\n\nAccording to the Majority, \u201cany reasonable person\u201d would have understood Wife\u2019s\n\ndirective that Husband sign the agreement on September 25, 2020, as a binding condition\n\nprecedent to contract formation, and \u201c[c]onversely, no reasonable person would perceive\n\nany flexibility in that deadline.\u201d Majority Op. at 9-10. But that is not what the trial court\n\nfound. There is no evidence that this so-called \u201cdirective\u201d was timely conveyed to Husband\n\nor that he acknowledged it. This \u201cdirective\u201d was not contained in the agreement, but rather\n\nappeared only in a cover letter dated September 25, 2020, authored by Wife\u2019s counsel and\n\nenclosing the agreement (the \u201cCover Letter\u201d). Husband did not testify that he read the\n\nCover Letter before the deadline passed or that he understood it to impose any binding\n\ncondition. Neither party\u2019s counsel testified as to what, if any, communications occurred\n\fregarding a deadline. Most notably, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as\n\nhearsay.\n\nIn effect, the Majority invalidates a fully executed, integrated settlement agreement\n\nbased entirely on an excluded hearsay document \u2013 a remarkably thin evidentiary reed on\n\nwhich to overturn not only a signed contract but also the trial court\u2019s supported factual\n\nfindings. In my view, the trial court got it right. Given the deference owed to a trial court\u2019s\n\nfindings, and in light of Maryland\u2019s strong policy favoring settlements and the efficient\n\nadministration of justice, see Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., 251 Md. 544, 550 (1968),\n\ncert. denied, 394 U.S. 974 (1969), I would affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n\nI.\n\nFacts\n\nI agree with the factual background set forth in the Majority opinion and will only\n\nsummarize additional facts in this opinion as needed.\n\nAfter a hearing on the Petitioner\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement, the trial judge\n\nruled on March 17, 2021, that the parties had reached a valid and enforceable settlement\n\nagreement following extensive negotiations. After spending approximately seven hours in\n\nmediation with a former judge of the Supreme Court of Maryland and engaging in nearly\n\nthree weeks of back-and-forth negotiation, the parties agreed on all material terms of a\n\nsettlement and reduced that agreement to writing. The agreement, finalized by Wife\u2019s\n\nattorney, was memorialized in a twelve\u2010page \u201cVoluntary Separation and Property\n\nSettlement Agreement\u201d (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d).\n\f The uncontroverted record shows that Wife signed and initialed each page of the\n\nSettlement Agreement and dated it September 25, 2020. Wife had the Settlement\n\nAgreement notarized, certifying that she personally appeared before the notary to\n\n\u201cexecute[] this Agreement and made oath in due form of law that the matters and facts set\n\nforth in the foregoing Agreement true and correct as stated in the Agreement, and [that she]\n\nacknowledged that the Agreement is in fact her free act and deed and that she has full\n\nunderstanding of its terms.\u201d Husband signed and notarized the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 28, 2020.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms are undisputed: it became effective on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. The Settlement Agreement is fully integrated and prohibits any\n\namendments without mutual written consent. Both parties declared that the terms of the\n\nagreement were \u201cfair, just and reasonable\u201d and that they signed the agreement \u201cfreely and\n\nvoluntarily.\u201d Based on its analysis of the agreement, the trial court held that the parties\u2019\n\n\u201cintent can be determined from the unambiguous language in the [Settlement Agreement].\u201d\n\nConsequently, the trial court found that the Settlement Agreement was valid and\n\nenforceable as of September 25, 2020, and that there was mutual assent by the parties to\n\nbe bound by its terms.\n\nWife argued that there was no mutual assent to contract because Husband did not\n\ncomply with her demand in the Cover Letter that he sign the Settlement Agreement on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. In that letter, Wife\u2019s counsel wrote, \u201c[t]his Agreement is delivered\n\nto you in settlement of the parties\u2019 outstanding disputes on condition that the Agreement\n\nand Note be executed by Mr. Pattison today.\u201d But the Cover Letter was excluded from\n\fevidence as inadmissible hearsay. During the hearing, however, Wife\u2019s counsel read\n\nexcerpts from the Cover Letter to Husband and he was questioned as to whether he was\n\nfamiliar with the letter. The authors and recipients of the hearsay documents did not testify.\n\nHusband testified that he first saw the original copy of the Settlement Agreement\n\nwith Wife\u2019s signature \u201c[o]n the morning of Monday, September 28th, 2020.\u201d Because he\n\nwas quarantined after testing positive for Covid, he made arrangements with his attorney\n\nto have the Settlement Agreement dropped off on the sidewalk outside his home. He then\n\nsigned the Settlement Agreement, had it notarized, and returned it to his counsel. Husband\n\ntestified that he saw an emailed version of the Settlement Agreement at some point after 5\n\np.m. on Friday, September 25. He was not sure if that email version he saw was signed by\n\nMs. Pattison. No exhibit was admitted into evidence that purported to be the emailed\n\nversion of the Settlement Agreement or Cover Letter. The Cover Letter itself does not\n\nindicate that it was emailed to Mr. Pattison or his counsel but indicates that Ms. Pattison\n\nwas copied on the email.\n\nWife testified that she signed the Settlement Agreement \u201caround noon\u201d on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020, and instructed her counsel to deliver it \u201cwith condition that the\n\nAgreement and Note be executed by Mr. Pattison that Friday.\u201d Yet she neither directly\n\ncommunicated that condition to Husband nor did Husband testify specifically that he saw\n\nthe Cover Letter on that date. There is no evidence in the record of whether the attorneys\n\ncommunicated with each other about the deadline contained in the Cover Letter. What we\n\ndo know is that the Settlement Agreement contained no such deadline; Wife never\n\fconveyed one directly; and neither attorney was in the office late Friday afternoon,\n\nSeptember 25, to receive the executed documents.\n\nThe trial court ruled that the language of the Settlement Agreement\n\n\u201cunambiguously[] indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into a[n] . . . agreement\n\non September 25th, 2020 to settle all matters[.]\u201d With respect to the alleged condition\n\nprecedent, all that the trial judge had before her were the parties\u2019 competing testimonies \u2013\n\nHusband\u2019s testimony that he never understood September 25, 2020, to be a firm cutoff, and\n\nWife\u2019s recollections of her instructions to her counsel regarding the alleged condition\n\nprecedent. The trial court relied on neither the Cover Letter nor the emails between counsel\n\nthat it excluded from evidence. On that record, the trial court found the alleged deadline\n\nuncommunicated and unenforceable, holding that \u201c[a]fter consideration of the evidence\n\nand considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The trial court further\n\nreasoned that \u201c[e]ven if for argument sake communication that Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer\n\nincluded a time limit, contract formation still would have occurred through the action of\n\nthe parties.\u201d\n\nII.\n\nStandard of Review\n\nWhen an action is tried without a jury, an appellate court reviews both the law and\n\nthe evidence. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The trial court\u2019s factual findings \u2013 including findings\n\nbased on witness credibility, inferences from conduct, and the surrounding context of an\n\nalleged agreement \u2013 are reviewed for clear error. See Torboli v. Torboli, 127 Md. App.\n\f666, 672 (1999). The appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party, City of Bowie v. MIE Props., Inc., 398 Md. 657, 676 (2007) and resolves\n\nall evidentiary conflicts in the prevailing party\u2019s favor. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Steele\n\nSoftware Sys. Corp., 154 Md. App. 97, 107 n.1 (2003), cert. denied, 380 Md. 619 (2004);\n\nsee also Brault Graham, LLC v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, P.C., 211 Md. App. 638,\n\n659 (2013) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and\n\nreviews the trial court's legal conclusions de novo.\u201d). If there is any competent and material\n\nevidence to support the court\u2019s findings, those findings cannot be held clearly erroneous.\n\nL.W. Wolfe Enters., Inc. v. Md. Nat\u2019l Golf, L.P., 165 Md. App. 339, 343 (2005).\n\nIII.\n\nDiscussion\n\nI disagree with the Majority that Wife imposed a valid condition precedent to the\n\nformation of the Settlement Agreement through the Cover Letter. The parties agreed to\n\nsettle this case effective September 25, 2020, as evidenced by their notarized signatures on\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The terms and conditions of their settlement are reflected in\n\nthat agreement. Nowhere in the Settlement Agreement is there a timing provision on\n\nsigning the agreement or any reference to the Cover Letter. Moreover, the Cover Letter\n\nwas deemed hearsay by the trial court and was not admitted into evidence. At most,\n\nwhether Wife imposed a valid condition precedent presented a disputed factual question \u2013\n\nnamely, whether she clearly and effectively communicated a firm deadline for Husband to\n\nsign the agreement on September 25, 2020. The trial court answered that question in the\n\nnegative and its finding is well supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.\n\f A.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That There Was Mutual Assent\n For the Settlement Agreement Is Entitled to Deference\n\nThe trial court correctly found that the parties reached mutual assent to settle the\n\ncase effective September 25, 2020. After nearly three weeks of back-and-forth\n\nnegotiations and multiple drafts, Wife\u2019s counsel prepared the final agreement, which Wife\n\nsigned in two original copies, initialed on each page, and had notarized. Husband likewise\n\ntestified that he agreed to all the terms and conditions. The trial court found that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was fully integrated and effective under its express terms on\n\nSeptember 25, 2020. There was no allegation of duress, fraud, or mistake. 1 Wife signed\n\nof her own volition, fully represented by counsel, and under no compulsion to execute the\n\ndocument. Husband did the same on Monday, September 28, 2020.\n\nThe trial court concluded that the Settlement Agreement:\n\n[U]nambiguously, indicates a mutual assent by the parties to enter into\n a voluntary separation and property agreement on September 25th, 2020 to\n settle all matters of every kind and character arising from their marital\n relationship.\n\nAs a result, this Court finds that the threshold issue of whether mutual\n assent, the essential prerequisite to the creation or formation of a contract,\n has occurred.\n\nI find that the trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion are well-supported by the\n\nevidentiary record in this case.\n Wife alleged duress in her motion to set aside the Settlement Agreement, but did\nnot introduce any evidence of duress at the hearing, and ultimately withdrew the motion.\n\f The trial court further determined that because the parties\u2019 intent to form a contract\n\ncould be gleaned from the unambiguous language contained in the Settlement Agreement,\n\nconsideration of the Cover Letter was not appropriate because it was barred by the parol\n\nevidence rule. I agree with this ruling as well. See Calomiris v. Wood, 353 Md. 425, 361-\n\n62 (1999) (\u201cUnder the parol evidence rule, a written agreement \u2018discharges prior\n\nagreements,\u2019 thereby rendering legally inoperative communications and negotiations\n\nleading up to the written contract.\u201d) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\n\n213 (1979)).\n\nThere is ample competent evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding of a binding\n\ncontract: the fully executed, integrated, and notarized Settlement Agreement itself, Wife\u2019s\n\ndelivery of the signed originals, and Husband\u2019s express acceptance of its terms. The trial\n\ncourt credited this direct evidence in finding mutual assent \u2013 a finding we review only for\n\nclear error. See Md. Rule 8-131(c). The Majority ignores the trial court\u2019s finding of mutual\n\nassent and its interpretation of the express terms of the Settlement Agreement. Instead, the\n\nMajority relies on an excluded post hoc hearsay document to conclude that Wife\u2019s\n\npurported \u201coffer\u201d had not been \u201caccepted\u201d and expired at midnight on September 25. As\n\ndiscussed below, I disagree with this approach because it rewrites the factual record,\n\ndisregards the trial court\u2019s firsthand credibility determinations, and relies on excluded\n\nhearsay to reach its conclusion.\n\f B.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Wife Did Not Impose\n A Valid Condition Precedent Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\nHaving determined that the fully executed, integrated Settlement Agreement was\n\nbinding and enforceable as of September 25, 2020, the trial court also evaluated whether\n\nWife\u2019s testimony \u2013 that she conditioned her offer on Husband\u2019s signing by that date \u2013 was\n\nsupported by the evidence. The trial court found that it was not, explaining: \u201cAfter\n\nconsideration of the evidence and considering the credibility of the witnesses, I do not find\n\nthat Mrs. Pattison\u2019s offer included a definite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d\n\nBecause that factual finding is entitled to deference under Maryland Rule 8-131(c) unless\n\n\u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d see Mercy Medical Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare of the Mid-Atl.,\n\nInc., 149 Md. App. 336, 355 (2003), and because the record amply supports that finding,\n\nthe trial court ruling should be affirmed.\n\nThe reasons offered by the Majority to overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling are\n\nunpersuasive.\n\nFirst, the Cover Letter could not impose a valid condition precedent to formation of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement. The letter was drafted after Wife had already executed the\n\nSettlement Agreement, contains no reference to any signature deadline, and cannot\n\nretroactively alter a contract already formed as of September 25. A condition precedent by\n\ndefinition must exist at the moment of contract formation; it cannot be grafted on by a\n\nunilateral post-execution communication.\n\f Second, there is no evidence that any deadline was directly conveyed to Mr. Pattison\n\nprior to midnight on September 25, much less that he acknowledged or ratified such a\n\ndeadline. No one \u2013 neither Mr. Pattison, the attorneys, nor Ms. Pattison \u2013 testified that a\n\nSeptember 25, 2020 deadline was expressly conveyed to Mr. Pattison. Mr. Pattison\n\nacknowledged receiving and being familiar with the Cover Letter; but that does not\n\nestablish that he read or understood the letter as of the evening of September 25, or that he\n\nregarded it as imposing a binding deadline.\n\nMr. Pattison was asked directly whether he understood there to be \u201ca condition that\n\nyou sign the agreement and the note on September 25.\u201d He responded: \u201cThat\u2019s not\n\ncorrect.\u201d He elaborated:\n\nBecause the next sentence [of the Cover Letter] says, \u2018I will assume that we\n will have a final guaranty signed by Mr. Pattison by close of business on\n Monday.\u2019 My interpretation was [Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney] needed all the\n executed documents by Monday, because without the personal guaranty and\n the promissory note, the settlement agreement is unenforceable.\n\nMr. Pattison further testified that he understood there to be no deadline or expiration\n\ndate for his signature on the Settlement Agreement. He believed, based on his attorney\u2019s\n\ncommunications with Ms. Pattison\u2019s attorney, that the parties had reached agreement on\n\nall terms as of Friday, September 25, 2020, and that he was obligated to sign the personal\n\nguaranty and promissory note in the days that followed. When asked if it was his position\n\nthat he could sign the settlement documents on Monday, September 28, when he provided\n\nthe final guaranty, Mr. Pattison answered: \u201cMy position has always been that.\u201d\n\nI disagree with the Majority opinion that Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was\n\nirrelevant. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Mr. Pattison\u2019s understanding was informed, at least\n\fin part, on his understanding that he and Wife had agreed to all outstanding issues effective\n\nSeptember 25 as evidenced by Wife\u2019s execution of the Settlement Agreement. With respect\n\nto the timing of his signature, Mr. Pattison understood that he could execute all of the\n\nsettlement documents on Monday, September 28. The trial court credited that testimony,\n\nand it provided a reasonable basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that there was no clear\n\ncondition precedent tied to the September 25 date.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s citation to Ray v. Eurice & Bros, Inc., 201 Md. 115 (1952) is\n\nmisplaced. See Majority Op. at 8-9. Ray and its progeny stand for the principle that a\n\nparty\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant when interpreting the terms of a contract that both\n\nparties signed. Here, it is undisputed that the Cover Letter was not incorporated into the\n\nSettlement Agreement, was not signed or agreed to by Husband (or perhaps timely seen),\n\nand, importantly, never admitted into evidence. Since the Cover Letter was not part of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Ray does not resolve whether that letter\u2019s terms \u2013 standing alone \u2013\n\ncreate a legally enforceable condition precedent. As the trial court correctly recognized,\n\nthey did not.\n\nThird, the Cover Letter was excluded from evidence as inadmissible hearsay and its\n\ncontents cannot be considered on appellate review as a basis for overturning the trial court\u2019s\n\nfactual findings. 2 Wife did not challenge that exclusion on appeal, so we should not\n The Majority\u2019s analytical variability on the trial court\u2019s findings below is\nunderscored by its effort to recast the Cover Letter as non-hearsay. See Majority Op. at 15\nn.4. The Majority argues that the Cover Letter was not offered for its truth, but rather \u201cfor\nthe legal effect of Wife\u2019s expression of the deadline. That is, the delivery of the letter with\nsuch contents constituted an act with independent legal significance.\u201d But that effect\n\freconsider its exclusion now. See Md. Rule 8-131(a); Robinson v. State, 404 Md. 208, 217\n\n(2008). The fact that Wife\u2019s counsel read the contents of the Cover Letter to Husband and\n\nWife during questioning does not transform inadmissible material into admissible\n\nevidence. See cf. Clermont v. State, 348 Md. 419, 429 (1998) (defense counsel\u2019s statement\n\ndid not constitute as evidence and was properly struck from the record). It is manifestly\n\nunfair to strike down a contract based on a document the trial court neither admitted into\n\nevidence nor relied upon in its ruling. The Majority cites no case to the contrary.\n\nFourth, the Majority overlooks the fact that the Cover Letter was both legally and\n\npractically incapable of imposing a same-day deadline. Because the Settlement Agreement\n\ndid not include a counterpart clause, Mr. Pattison was not authorized to simply signed an\n\nemail copy of the agreement as the Majority suggests. Such a clause typically allows\n\ncontracts to be executed in \u201ccounterparts, and each counterpart will have the same force\n\nand effect as an original and will constitute an effective, binding agreement on the part of\n\neach of the undersigneds.\u201d See Alan S. Gutterman, Business Transactions Solutions \u00a7\n\nhinges on the recipient\u2019s timely awareness of \u201cWife\u2019s expression of the deadline\u201d \u2013 a\nfactual dispute the trial court resolved in Husband\u2019s favor. Indeed, the very case the\nMajority cites \u2013 Garner v. State, 414 Md. 372 (2010) \u2013 undermines the notion that it does\nnot matter if the offeree \u201cdid not learn about the offer until after it expired.\u201d Majority Op.\nat 15 n.4. In order to constitute non-hearsay, a \u201cverbal act\u201d must not only have independent\nlegal significance, but also is clearly communicated to the recipient to give it evidentiary\nsignificance. Garner, 414 Md. at 382 (\u201ccan I get a 40\u201d was a verbal act with legal\nsignificance and actually received by the listener). More fundamentally, the time to invoke\nthis argument has long passed. Unlike in Garner, where the hearsay issue was appealed,\nWife did not raise this argument before the trial court. Neither party challenged the\nexclusion of the Cover Letter on appeal, and both structured their proofs at trial\naccordingly. Waiver and failure to preserve preclude this Court from reversing the trial\ncourt\u2019s evidentiary ruling. The Majority cites no authority permitting it to revive and rely\non excluded hearsay at this stage \u2013 and I know of none.\n\f113:130 (Thomson Reuters 2010). These clauses are standard when parties are expected\n\nto sign at different times or locations. Indeed, the Cover Letter acknowledged that Ms.\n\nPattison had already signed both originals and instructed Mr. Pattison to \u201ccounter-execute\u201d\n\nthem \u2013 not sign an email copy. Thus, this instruction contemplated sequential, not\n\nsimultaneous, execution of the Settlement Agreement. 3\n\nSame-day counter-execution of the Settlement Agreement was also impractical. It\n\nis undisputed that Wife\u2019s counsel sent the executed originals late in the day on Friday,\n\nSeptember 25, to a law office he knew would be closed for the weekend. See Majority Op.\n\nat 13-14. Mr. Pattison, who was incapacitated on September 25 as a result of having Covid,\n\ndid not receive the originals until Monday, September 28. How, then, can the Cover Letter\n\nimpose a \u201cdefinite deadline\u201d requiring execution on September 25, when the documents\n\nwere physically inaccessible to Mr. Pattison until three days later? The Majority offers no\n\nanswer \u2013 only speculation that his counsel could have requested an extension. See Majority\n\nOp. at 15.\n\nFifth, the Majority disregards the trial judge\u2019s credibility determinations. After\n\nhearing testimony from both parties, the judge found that Ms. Pattison did not impose \u201ca\n\ndefinite time expiration of September 25th, 2020.\u201d The Majority declares credibility\n This is further evidence that the Cover Letter was merely a timing provision that\nWife sought to impose after the fact. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, any temporal gap\nbetween the parties\u2019 respective signatures would reduce every mutually assented to\nagreement to a mere \u201coffer\u201d until the other party signed \u2013 an outcome squarely at odds with\nestablished principles of contract law.\n\f\u201cirrelevant\u201d and instead relies on counsel\u2019s scheduling emails \u2013 which were also excluded\n\nas hearsay \u2013 to conclude that Husband \u201cwas engaged in the settlement process on\n\nSeptember 25, notwithstanding his illness.\u201d Majority Op. at 14. Not only is this conclusion\n\ninconsistent with Mr. Pattison\u2019s testimony, 4 but it also ignores the trial court\u2019s role in\n\nresolving factual disputes.\n\nFinally, the Majority gives short shrift to the standard of review. The trial court,\n\nsitting as fact-finder, heard the evidence, evaluated credibility, and concluded that Wife\n\nfailed to prove the existence of a valid condition precedent. That conclusion was rooted in\n\nthe plain language of the Settlement Agreement, which established the effective date of the\n\nSettlement Agreement as of September 25 and which contained no deadline for Husband\u2019s\n\nsignature, and no express condition precedent. Viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to Husband as the prevailing party, and resolving all evidentiary conflicts in his\n\nfavor, we should affirm rather than second-guess the trial court\u2019s factual findings or fill\n\nevidentiary gaps with unwarranted inferences against him. See Knowles v. Binford, 268\n\nMd. 2, 11 (1972) (\u201c[T]he trial court is not only the judge of a witness\u2019 credibility, but is\n\nalso the judge of the weight to attach to the evidence[.]\u201d).\n\nIV.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to consider the context in which this dispute arose. On\n\nMarch 16, 2021, the trial court convened a two-day enforcement hearing on Husband\u2019s\n Mr. Pattison testified that he was ill with Covid on September 25, 2020, and slept\nmost of the day.\n\fmotion to enforce the Settlement Agreement he and Wife had negotiated and agreed to\n\nthrough counsel. In evidence before the court was the fully executed Settlement\n\nAgreement \u2013 signed, initialed, and notarized by both parties. The terms of the agreement\n\nwere clear and unambiguous.\n\nMs. Pattison seeks to transform an after-the-fact cover letter \u2013 excluded from\n\nevidence as hearsay \u2013 into a condition precedent to contract formation. She contends that\n\nthe agreement sent to Mr. Pattison on September 25, 2020, constituted a mere offer, subject\n\nto automatic withdrawal at midnight unless signed that same day. But this ignores that the\n\nSettlement Agreement was effective as of September 25 and there is no indication in the\n\nrecord that any such \u201ccondition\u201d was clearly communicated to Mr. Pattison. Notably,\n\nneither Ms. Pattison nor her attorney advised Mr. Pattison that the \u201coffer\u201d was withdrawn\n\nafter the supposed deadline passed. To the contrary, when Ms. Pattison received the\n\nexecuted agreement from Mr. Pattison on Monday, September 28, she raised no objections.\n\nIt was not until October 14 \u2013 seventeen days later, and two weeks after Mr. Pattison had\n\nbegun performing under the agreement \u2013 that Ms. Pattison first asserted that no contract\n\nhad been formed due to an unmet condition precedent. 5\n I agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that even assuming the Cover Letter imposed\na valid condition precedent, the record demonstrates that Wife waived that condition by\nher actions. Where an offeror \u201cwho does not in fact insist upon\u201d a time limit and continues\nnegotiations \u201cmay indicate a continued willingness to stand by the terms of its offer,\u201d\nthereby extending the acceptance period and effectively creating a new offer. Williston on\nContracts \u00a7 5:5.\n\f In reversing the trial court\u2019s enforcement of the Settlement Agreement, the Majority\n\nhas effectively announced a new rule of contract construction: a fully executed, integrated\n\nsettlement agreement \u2013 signed, notarized, and negotiated by counsel \u2013 may be set aside if\n\none party can point to any contemporaneous, extrinsic communication arguably\n\nconditioning its formation. That departs from Maryland\u2019s objective theory of contracts, as\n\narticulated in Ray, which holds that \u201c[t]he only intent of the parties to a contract which is\n\nessential, is an intent to say the words and do the acts which constitute their manifestation\n\nof assent,\u201d judged by what a reasonable person in the parties\u2019 position would have\n\nunderstood. Ray, 201 Md. at 127. Even if one party is mistaken, and even if that mistake\n\ncreates a hardship, a clearly expressed, integrated written contract may not be varied by\n\nparol evidence \u2013 absent fraud, duress, or mutual mistake. Id. at 125.\n\nHere, there are no allegations of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake \u2013 nor even a claim\n\nthat enforcement of the agreement would create any hardship. Ms. Pattison simply changed\n\nher mind \u2013 nineteen days after signing the Settlement Agreement \u2013 presumably because\n\nshe decided she wanted more money than what the agreement provided. She even later\n\ndescribed the Settlement Agreement\u2019s terms as \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nBy supplanting the objective inquiry (what does the contract say?) with a subjective\n\none (what do the extrinsic, unincorporated communications say?), the Majority undermines\n\nthe certainty that integrated contracts are meant to provide. 6 The Majority\u2019s opinion invites\n The Majority insists that this case \u201cis not about what the Agreement says, it\u2019s about\n. . . offer and acceptance.\u201d Majority Op. at 15 n.4. Respectfully, that framing collapses\nunder the weight of the record. The trial court expressly found that the parties had already\n\flitigation over cover letters, emails, text messages, social media posts and other collateral\n\ndocuments or media a party may never have seen or agreed to \u2013 and renders enforcement\n\nof even signed, notarized, and fully integrated agreements uncertain.\n\nThe Majority opinion is even more problematic in the family law context, where\n\nemotions run high. By imposing strict black letter law as to offer and acceptance \u2013\n\nincorrectly, as it turns out here \u2013 the Majority opinion could significantly hamper the ability\n\nof judges to resolve these cases. Under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, a party who develops\n\nbuyer\u2019s remorse, or who for no reason at all wishes to return to the bargaining table without\n\nproviding a basis for doing so, need only append by email, or some separate writing, not\n\nagreed to or considered by the other party, a condition precedent that undercuts a carefully\n\ncrafted agreement that otherwise thoroughly and exclusively states the parties\u2019 mutual\n\nassent. With the Majority\u2019s view, where the record shows no disagreement by Ms. Pattison\n\nas to any term in the actual Settlement Agreement, the trial court\u2019s ability to make\n\ncredibility determinations, and most importantly, to resolve the case, has been effectively\n\nundercut. Ms. Pattison and other family law parties should not benefit from an incorrect\n\nformed a binding contract through mutual assent on September 25th \u2013 offer accepted. A\nmore apt analogy than the one posed by the Majority is where X and Y agree to the $200\ncar sale. Y signs a promissory note for $200, and X signs over title. Two hours later, X\nsends Y a text saying the sale is conditioned on my getting the $200 within the next 15\nminutes. Even where Y actually sees the text message (something that did not happen here\naccording to the trial court), this post hoc condition cannot retroactively alter the binding\nagreement already executed. It is exactly the Majority\u2019s elevation of the unilateral, post-\nexecution Cover Letter over the express and integrated terms of the Settlement Agreement\nthat is problematic, particularly here where the language of the Settlement Agreement\nprecludes precisely the kind of maneuver Wife has now effected with the Majority\u2019s\nendorsement.\n\fconstruct of contract law that prolongs the case by an unexpected condition precedent that\n\nwas wholly unreasonable under the circumstances. Gaming the resolution of family law\n\ncases in this manner benefits no one.\n\nThe trial court made no error in enforcing the Settlement Agreement based on the\n\nevidence before it, and the Majority identifies none \u2013 other than its argument that the\n\ninadmissible post-hoc Cover Letter was a valid condition precedent and is dispositive. The\n\nMajority offers no workable guidance to trial courts facing belated or collateral attacks on\n\nsettlement agreements. When does a \u201ccondition\u201d in a post-execution cover letter become\n\na valid condition precedent? Does mutual assent disappear simply because one party signs\n\nthe contract a few days after the other \u2013 particularly when sequential execution was\n\nanticipated? Does an integration clause preclude the enforcement of extrinsic terms that\n\ncontradict the agreement itself? And what role should trial courts play in enforcing written\n\nagreements when alleged conditions appear nowhere in the agreement and were never\n\nagreed to by the other party? I do not know the answers to these questions after reading\n\nthe Majority opinion. Instead, the Majority provides a roadmap for undoing signed\n\nsettlement agreements, undermining Maryland\u2019s strong public policy in favor of finality\n\nand resolution.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Majority opinion. Justice\n\nEaves has authorized me to state that she joins this dissent.\n\n18"

Answering only the question of liability, a jury found that Open\n\nfraudulently induced the City to enter the contract. The City elected to rescind\n\nthe contract, so the district court held a bench trial on restitution and ordered a\n\njudgment of almost $20 million against Open.\n\nOpen appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denials of its\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law. Because we find no error with the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s rulings or the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm. 2\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nIn February 2018, the City published a request for proposal (RFP) for a\n\nbilling software system for municipal utilities, including a new broadband\n\nutility called Connexion. On March 12, 2018, Open submitted a proposal for\n\nthe project based on its forthcoming software, Open SmartFlex Version 8. Open\n Except where the distinction matters, we refer to Open International and\nOpen Investments collectively as \u201cOpen.\u201d\n On February 19, 2025, Open moved for leave to file a supplemental\nappendix. We deny that motion.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 3\n\nclaimed that its product \u201ccomplie[d] with the vast majority of functional and\n\ntechnical requirements of th[e] RFP with one single and uniform product[.]\u201d\n\nSupp. App. vol. 4, at 1011 (emphasis omitted).\n\nThe RFP included a functional matrix that listed all the functional\n\nrequirements needed for the product and that directed bidders to complete the\n\nmatrix \u201caccurately and factually\u201d according to the provided grading rubric.\n\nSupp. App. vol. 8, at 2143. In its RFP response, Open graded about 90% of its\n\nhomegrown software\u2019s functionalities with \u201cA\u2019s,\u201d representing that the\n\nfunctionality was \u201cpart of [its software\u2019s] base system\u201d and that \u201c[n]o\n\n[m]odification [was] required.\u201d App. vol. 2, at 3.\n\nThe City selected Open International to be its vendor. And the parties\n\nformalized their contract with a Master Professional Services Agreement, in\n\nwhich Open Investments guaranteed Open International\u2019s performance under\n\nthe contract but made no contractual representations of its own. The contract\u2019s\n\nintroduction incorporates by reference the RFP and Open\u2019s proposal, which\n\nincludes the detailed functionality matrix for the services that Open\n\nInternational was to provide.\n\nThe project kicked off in late 2018 and suffered problems from the\n\nbeginning. One of the main sources of conflict was the customer self-service\n\nportal for the City\u2019s broadband-billing services. The service went live in\n\nAugust 2019 and had \u201ccritical functionality missing.\u201d App. vol. 7, at 68\u201369. In\n\nNovember 2019, the City cited the portal as one of its primary concerns, stating\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 4\n\nthat the \u201cportal testing hours [have been] extensive\u201d and that the \u201cpresented\n\nportal was different than what got delivered[.]\u201d App. vol. 9, at 26\u201327.\n\nDespite these problems, the City continued its contractual relationship\n\nwith Open International. Throughout the project, the parties negotiated and\n\nexecuted twenty-nine project change requests (PCRs), including PCR 19, which\n\naddressed issues relating to the customer portal. In a March 2020 memorandum,\n\nthe City\u2019s external project manager documented her concerns over problems\n\nwith Open International\u2019s product, but still recommended that the City preserve\n\nits relationship with Open International. And in June 2020, both parties agreed\n\nto a formal amendment that extended project milestones into 2021 and assigned\n\nmost of the added project costs to the City. The parties again agreed to extend\n\nthe project in December 2020.\n\nPrompted by this second amendment, the City hired a third-party\n\nconsultant to assess the project. In an April 2021 report, the consultant advised\n\nthe City to continue the project with Open International despite the project\n\ndelays and frustrations. Completing the project with Open International\n\nremained \u201cPlan A\u201d for the City. App. vol. 7, at 120\u201321. The parties jointly\n\nreviewed the functional matrix to evaluate whether the program was performing\n\nas Open had represented it would. But during the review in April and May\n\n2021, the City determined that Open\u2019s precontractual assertions about its\n\nsoftware\u2019s capabilities were false.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 5\n\nAlso during the review, Open International sent the City a notice of\n\ndefault stating that it could not proceed with its work unless and until the City\n\ncured certain deficiencies. From the City\u2019s view, that default notice \u201cwas a\n\nsignificant breach of trust.\u201d Id. at 123. Then on May 28, 2021, the City served\n\nits own notices\u2014a notice of dispute and notice of termination. In June, Open\n\nInternational provided a \u201cReset Proposal\u201d that acknowledged the results of the\n\nfunctional matrix audit\u2014which showed that only 17.3% of the \u201c[i]n scope\u201d\n\nrequirements had been accepted\u2014and sought additional funds to complete the\n\nproject. Supp. App. vol. 9, at 2473. But the proposal would not cure the issues\n\nwithin the thirty days required by the contract, so the City initiated this lawsuit\n\non July 2, 2021. The City also promptly retained a second vendor and began\n\nimplementing that product, and it stopped all use of Open International\u2019s\n\nproduct as soon as the new platform was available in December 2021.\n\nII. Procedural Background\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the City sued Open for breach of contract, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, and fraud-in-the-inducement. The City based its tort claims\n\non misrepresentations about (1) the timing for executing the project and the\n\nlevel of support Open International would provide, (2) Open International\u2019s\n\nsoftware being \u201cready for implementation,\u201d and (3) the fitness of Open\n\nInternational\u2019s software for the City\u2019s needs. App. vol. 3, at 60\u201361 \u00b6\u00b6 70\u201373.\n\nOpen pleaded affirmative defenses and asserted a counterclaim for breach of\n\ncontract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 6\n\nDuring discovery, the City learned that despite Open grading almost 90%\n\nof the required functionalities as an \u201cA\u201d in its March 2018 RFP response, Open\n\nhad internally assessed its software as meeting only 59.4% of the required\n\nfunctionalities. Open\u2019s internal assessment was dated in March 2018, before it\n\nresponded to the RFP. Also, the City learned that Open had not graded the\n\nprovided software\u2014a third-party portal called \u201cMilestone\u201d\u2014in the\n\nfunctionality matrix but had instead graded its \u201chomegrown\u201d software. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 254\u201355.\n\nOpen moved for summary judgment on the City\u2019s tort claims, arguing\n\nthat the claims were barred by the contract\u2019s merger clause and Colorado\u2019s\n\neconomic-loss rule, and that the City had waived the claims by repeatedly\n\naffirming the contract. The district court denied the motion. See City of Fort\n\nCollins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-MEH, 2023 WL 3585214,\n\nat *1, *13 (D. Colo. May 22, 2023). Open then asked the court to require the\n\nCity to elect a remedy before trial\u2014either affirming the contract and receiving\n\ndamages or rescinding the contract and receiving restitution. But the court\n\ndecided that the City would not have to select a remedy until the jury returned a\n\nverdict on the tort claims. City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-\n\nCV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2023 WL 11868279, at *2, *4 (D. Colo. Sept. 27, 2023).\n\nIf the City elected damages, the jury would be instructed on the breach-of-\n\ncontract claims and counterclaims; if the City elected rescission, the jury would\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 7\n\nbe dismissed, and the court would hold a bench trial on rescission and\n\nrestitution.\n\nThe trial started on October 23, 2023, and lasted ten days. At the close of\n\nevidence, Open moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the breach-of-contract claim and the tort claims.\n\nThe court denied the motion. Then the court gave the jury \u201call of the general\n\nclosing instructions,\u201d but only the fraud and negligent-misrepresentation\n\n\u201cclaim-specific instructions.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 58\u201359. For each of the tort claims,\n\nthe verdict form asked whether the City had proved the claim against \u201cOpen\u201d\n\nand whether \u201cOpen\u201d had proved waiver or expiration of the statute of\n\nlimitations. App. vol. 6, at 4\u20136. The district court instructed the jury to find\n\nwaiver if:\n\n1. The City learned the actual or true facts after it began the project\n with Open, but before it ceased the project with Open; and\n 2. The City continued the project with Open with full knowledge of\n the actual facts when a reasonable person under the same or similar\n circumstances would not have done so.\nApp. vol. 5, at 165. Open objected to the City\u2019s request that the instruction\n\nspecify, \u201cfull knowledge of all the actual facts,\u201d but it did not otherwise object\n\nto the waiver instruction. App. vol. 15, at 7 (emphasis added).\n\nThe jury determined that the City had proved fraudulent inducement and\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, but that the City had waived the negligent-\n\nmisrepresentation claim. The City elected to rescind the contract, so the court\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 8\n\ndismissed the jury. And because the City elected to rescind the contract, Open\u2019s\n\ncounterclaim for breach of contract disappeared.\n\nOpen timely renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nRule 50(b). And as part of its rescission brief, it also moved under Rule 52(c)\n\nfor partial judgment, arguing (1) that the City\u2019s evidence did not support a\n\nrestitution award and (2) that the City had waived rescission as a remedy. 3 The\n\ncourt denied the Rule 52(c) motion, City of Fort Collins v. Open Int\u2019l, LLC, No.\n\n1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *11\u201312 (D. Colo. Mar. 21,\n\n2024), and entered judgment against \u201cOpen\u201d for just under $20 million. Open\n\nagain moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and moved\n\nunder Rule 52(b) for amended or additional findings and Rules 59(a) and (e) for\n\namendment of the judgment or a new trial. The court orally denied those\n\nmotions and the earlier Rule 50(b) motion. Open timely appealed, and we have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 4\n The district court correctly noted that Rule 52 is reserved for nonjury\ntrials, but nonetheless addressed Open\u2019s arguments \u201cin the hopes of obviating\nthe need to address the[] matters in the future[.]\u201d City of Fort Collins v. Open\nInt\u2019l, LLC, No. 1:21-CV-02063-CNS-SBP, 2024 WL 1239934, at *2\u20133 (D.\nColo. Mar. 21, 2024).\n The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\nOpen International and Open Investments are both Florida limited liability\ncompanies and their members are all Florida citizens. And Fort Collins is a city\nin Colorado, so it is a Colorado citizen. See App. vol. 3, at 47 \u00b6\u00b6 3\u20135.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 9\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOpen presents four arguments on appeal: (1) that Colorado\u2019s economic-\n\nloss rule and the parties\u2019 contract bar the City\u2019s tort claims; (2) that insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of fraud; (3) that the City waived its\n\nability to rescind the contract; and (4) that Open Investments cannot be held\n\nliable for the rescission award.\n\nI. Tort Claims Not Barred\n\nFirst, Open asserts that the district court erred by denying its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, which argued that the City\u2019s tort claims were\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule and the parties\u2019 contract.\n\n\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law, applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d Fresquez v.\n\nBNSF Ry. Co., 52 F.4th 1280, 1295 (10th Cir. 2022). In reviewing the denial of\n\nsuch a motion, \u201cwe draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty,\u201d and we reverse \u201conly if the evidence points but one way and is\n\nsusceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the nonmovant.\u201d Id.\n\nA. Colorado\u2019s Economic-Loss Rule\n\n\u201cUnder the economic loss rule, a party suffering only economic loss from\n\nthe breach of an express or implied contractual duty may not assert a tort claim\n\nfor such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.\u201d Mid-\n\nCentury Ins. Co. v. HIVE Constr., Inc., 567 P.3d 153, 158 (Colo. 2025)\n\n(citation modified). Though it is termed the \u201ceconomic loss rule,\u201d a \u201cmore\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 10\n\naccurate designation . . . would be the \u2018independent duty rule\u2019\u201d because the\n\n\u201ckey to determining the availability of a contract or tort action lies in\n\ndetermining the source of the duty that forms the basis of the action.\u201d Town of\n\nAlma v. AZCO Constr., Inc., 10 P.3d 1256, 1262 & n.8 (Colo. 2000).\n\nTo determine whether a tort duty arises independent of a contract,\n\nColorado courts ask: \u201c(1) whether the relief sought in [tort] is the same as the\n\ncontractual relief; (2) whether there is a recognized common law duty of care in\n\n[tort]; and (3) whether the [tort] duty differs in any way from the contractual\n\nduty.\u201d 5 BRW, Inc. v. Dufficy & Sons, Inc., 99 P.3d 66, 74 (Colo. 2004). After\n\nexamining each factor, we conclude that the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by\n\nthe economic-loss rule.\n\nFirst, the City is seeking the same relief in tort that it is seeking under\n\nthe contract. In its complaint, the City sought rescission for both the tort and\n\ncontract claims, and alternatively sought damages for its contract claim. App.\n Though the Colorado Supreme Court has never held as much, dicta in\nColorado cases suggest that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not apply\nto intentional tort claims.\u201d Mid-Century Ins. Co., 567 P.3d at 156\u201357; see, e.g.,\nUnited Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1226 (10th\nCir. 2000) (\u201cIt is settled in Colorado that the economic loss rule applies only to\ntort claims based on negligence[.]\u201d); Bermel v. BlueRadios, Inc., 440 P.3d\n1150, 1153, 1154 n.6 (Colo. 2019) (observing that previous cases had applied\nthe economic-loss rule \u201cto bar only certain common law negligence claims\u201d and\nstating that \u201cthe economic loss rule generally should not be available to shield\nintentional tortfeasors from liability for misconduct that happens also to breach\na contractual obligation\u201d); Town of Alma, 10 P.3d at 1263 (citing Brody v.\nBock, 897 P.2d 769, 776 (Colo. 1995), a case that involved a common-law\nfraud claim, as an example of a common-law tort that is independent of a\nbreach-of-contract claim).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 11\n\nvol. 3, at 62 \u00b6 79 (rescission for tort claim), 64 \u00b6 89 (rescission for contract\n\nclaim, alternatively damages); see also id. at 47 \u00b6 2. So this factor supports\n\nOpen\u2019s view that the economic-loss rule bars the City\u2019s tort claims. See Dream\n\nFinders Homes LLC v. Weyerhaeuser NR Co., 506 P.3d 108, 121 (Colo. App.\n\n2021).\n\nSecond, because fraudulent inducement is a common-law tort claim,\n\n\u201cthere is a recognized common law duty of care in [tort.]\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74;\n\nsee also Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., 373 P.3d 603, 607 (Colo. 2016).\n\nSo this factor supports the City.\n\nThird, and most critically, \u201cthe [tort] duty differs . . . from the\n\ncontractual duty.\u201d BRW, 99 P.3d at 74. Open claims that the parties\u2019 contract\n\n\u201cset[s] out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is based\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cthe grades Open assigned to thousands of software functionalities in its\n\nresponse to the City\u2019s RFP, and the City\u2019s claim that some of the delivered\n\nfunctionalities were inferior to those representations.\u201d Op. Br. at 25\u201326. So\n\nbecause the contract incorporated those grades and provided the requirements\n\nfor Open\u2019s software service, Open concludes that the contract subsumes the\n\nCity\u2019s fraud claim. We disagree.\n\nTorts based on precontractual conduct are often found to be independent\n\nof the contract. In re Bloom, 622 B.R. 366, 429 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2020)\n\n(collecting cases). For example, in Van Rees v. Unleaded Software, Inc., the\n\nColorado Supreme Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 12\n\nhad \u201cwrongfully induced him into entering a contractual relationship knowing\n\nthat it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised [services]\u201d\n\nestablished \u201ca violation of a tort duty that is independent of the contract.\u201d 373\n\nP.3d at 607. The court explained that \u201c[t]here is an important distinction\n\nbetween failure to perform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party\n\nto enter a contract in the first place.\u201d Id. It said that the \u201ccritical question\u201d was\n\nnot whether the tort claims were \u201crelated to the promises that eventually formed\n\nthe basis of the contract,\u201d but \u201cwhether the tort claims flow[ed] from an\n\nindependent duty under tort law.\u201d Id.; cf. Keller v. A.O. Smith Harvestore\n\nProds., Inc., 819 P.2d 69, 73 (Colo. 1991) (\u201c[C]laims of negligent\n\nmisrepresentation are based not on principles of contractual obligation but on\n\nprinciples of duty and reasonable conduct.\u201d).\n\nVan Rees is on point with our case. There, the parties contracted for web-\n\nrelated services and the development of new websites. 373 P.3d at 605. The\n\ncontract specified what services were to be provided and when. Id. Like our\n\ncase, the defendant \u201cmissed deadlines and failed to deliver the promised\n\nservices.\u201d Id. That was the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. Id.\n\nBut during contract negotiations, the defendant allegedly \u201cknew that it lacked\n\nsufficient staff to complete the website on time, and did not intend to provide\n\nthe [full services],\u201d so it induced the plaintiff into a contractual relationship\n\n\u201cknowing that it did not have the capability to perform any of the promised\n\nweb-related services.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. Like our case, the defendant\u2019s\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 13\n\nmisrepresentation about its capabilities formed the basis for the tort claim. Id.\n\nat 607. And that claim was \u201can independent duty that did not arise from the\n\ncontracts,\u201d so it was \u201cnot barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id. at 606\u201307. The\n\nsame is true here. 6\n\nNotwithstanding Van Rees, Open asserts that the City\u2019s claims are still\n\nbarred because the contract memorialized all precontractual representations,\n\nwhich means that the contract subsumed any tort duty. See BRW, 99 P.3d at 74\n\n(\u201cIf we conclude that the duty of care owed by [the defendants] was\n\nmemorialized in the contracts, it follows that the plaintiff has not shown any\n\nduty independent of the interrelated contracts[.]\u201d). But none of Open\u2019s cited\n\ncases involve precontractual representations. See id. at 75 (distinguishing its\n\nfacts\u2014a misrepresentation \u201cduring performance\u201d of the contract\u2014from cases\n\ninvolving misrepresentations \u201cprior to the execution of an agreement\u201d (citation\n\nmodified)); Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 123 (finding no independent duty\n Open criticizes Van Rees\u2019s distinction between a failure to perform the\ncontract and promises that induce a party to enter a contract. Reply Br. at 15\u2013\n16. It relies on HealthBanc Int\u2019l, LLC v. Synergy Worldwide, Inc., a Utah\nSupreme Court decision in which the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to\nadopt a blanket rule that fraudulent inducement is \u201cnecessarily independent of\nthe contract\u201d and instead held that a fraudulent-inducement claim that \u201coverlaps\ncompletely\u201d with a breach-of-contract claim is barred by the economic-loss\nrule. 435 P.3d 193, 196\u201397 (Utah 2018). The court criticized the Colorado\nSupreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Van Rees, calling its distinction between\nperformance and inducement \u201cillusory\u201d when \u201cthe subject matter of the\ninducing promises [is] later negotiated for and included in the contract.\u201d Id. at\n197. But whatever the merits of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning,\nHealthBanc is not binding here because the parties\u2019 contract is governed by\nColorado law, not Utah law. So Van Rees still controls.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 14\n\nbecause the relevant \u201cconduct occurred after the parties entered into the\n\ncontract\u201d). The closest Open gets is Smart v. Stropas, which involved a seller\u2019s\n\nprecontractual nondisclosure of latent defects in the home. No. 24CA0614,\n\n2025 WL 274726, at *2\u20133 (Colo. App. Jan. 23, 2025) (unpublished). There,\n\nthough the intermediate-appellate court found that the economic-loss rule\n\nbarred the home-buyer\u2019s fraudulent-nondisclosure claim, the contract\n\nprovisions exactly tracked the alleged tort duty. Id. at *3. The parties\u2019 contract\n\nboth (1) required the sellers to disclose any knowledge of methamphetamine\n\nbeing \u201cmanufactured, processed, cooked, disposed of, used or stored at the\n\nProperty\u201d and (2) represented that the sellers had no knowledge of such\n\nmethamphetamine use. Id. at *1. So the tort duty to disclose latent defects\n\n(here, the methamphetamine use) did not \u201cdiffer[] in any way from the\n\ncontractual duty\u201d to disclose methamphetamine use. Id. at *4 (citation\n\nmodified). \u201cBecause the contract explicitly addressed the sellers\u2019 obligation to\n\ndisclose methamphetamine,\u201d the tort duty was subsumed by the contract and\n\nbarred by the economic-loss rule. Id. at *3.\n\nThe same is not true for our case; the parties\u2019 contract warranted only the\n\nquality of Open International\u2019s performance, not the accuracy of Open\u2019s\n\nrepresentations about its capabilities. Though Open claims that the parties\u2019\n\ncontract \u201cset out precisely the same duty on which the City\u2019s fraud claim is\n\nbased\u201d\u2014to deliver software functionalities consistent with the representations\n\nin the contract, Op. Br. at 25\u2014we agree with the City that Open conflates \u201cits\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 15\n\nultimate failures to provide and deliver the software functionalities in breach of\n\nits contractual obligations\u201d with its \u201cfraudulent representations about its\n\nsoftware which induced the City into\u201d the contract, Resp. Br. at 29\u201330. See Van\n\nRees, 373 P.3d at 607 (\u201cThere is an important distinction between failure to\n\nperform the contract itself, and promises that induce a party to enter into a\n\ncontract in the first place.\u201d); see also Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 120 (\u201cThe\n\neconomic loss rule does not apply to claims arising from a defendant\u2019s pre-\n\ncontractual conduct because, at that time, there was no contract that could have\n\nsubsumed identical tort duties.\u201d). Like the plaintiff in Van Rees, the City\u2019s \u201ctort\n\nclaims are based on misrepresentations made prior to the formation of the\n\ncontracts,\u201d which fraudulently induced it to enter the contract \u201cand therefore\n\nviolated an independent duty in tort to refrain from such conduct.\u201d 373 P.3d at\n\n607. So applying Van Rees, the third factor supports the City and finding that\n\n\u201cthe claims are not barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d Id.\n\nAs a final argument, Open claims that the economic-loss rule bars the\n\nCity\u2019s claims because the City is recovering a remedy that is expressly\n\nexcluded under the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at 125\n\n(\u201cSophisticated commercial entities . . . may not circumvent the exclusion of\n\ndamages in their contracts by cloaking their claims in tort theories.\u201d). The\n\ncontract states that \u201cOpen\u2019s entire liability\u201d for breaching any of the warranties\n\n\u201cwill be for Open to correct or reperform any nonconforming [s]ervices[.]\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 7 \u00b6 2.1. And though the limitations-of-liability provision\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 16\n\ncontemplates damages and limits the type and amount of damages that can be\n\nrecovered, recovery of damages is limited to (1) indemnification claims,\n\n(2) intentional breaches of the confidentiality and personally-identifiable-\n\ninformation provisions, and (3) unauthorized use of Open\u2019s intellectual\n\nproperty. See id. at 12\u201313 \u00b6\u00b6 12.1\u201312.2. Yet the City sought rescission and\n\nalternatively damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.\n\nBut Open doesn\u2019t cite any Colorado Supreme Court case that supports\n\nthat this is a relevant consideration for determining whether a tort duty is\n\nindependent of a contract. And the cases that Open does cite all involve tort\n\nduties that were subsumed by the contract. See Dream Finders, 506 P.3d at\n\n123\u201325 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cduty to not make misrepresentations\n\nor engage in fraud after they entered into the contract\u201d was \u201csubsumed within\n\nthe contract through the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d and then\n\nobserving that the claimants sought to recover \u201cthe very category of damages\u201d\n\nthat was barred by the contract); RE/MAX, LLC v. Quicken Loans Inc., 295 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 1163, 1170 (D. Colo. 2018) (\u201c[T]o the extent that Quicken Loans\n\nalleges misrepresentations by RE/MAX that are memorialized in the [contract],\n\nthe parties allocated risk with respect to those obligations by contract, and tort\n\nclaims based on those obligations are barred by the economic loss rule.\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)). So though the City seeks to recover a type of relief that the\n\ncontract prohibits, the conduct warranting the relief is independent of, and\n\ntherefore not governed by, the contract.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 17\n\nThus, under Colorado law, the City\u2019s tort claims are not barred by the\n\neconomic-loss rule.\n\nB. Merger Clause and Other Provisions\n\nOpen also contends that the contract\u2019s merger clause and limited-\n\nwarranty provisions bar the City\u2019s tort claims.\n\nThough a merger clause \u201climit[s] future contractual disputes to issues . . .\n\nexpressly set forth in the executed document,\u201d misrepresentation claims \u201care\n\nbased not on principles of contractual obligation but on principles of duty and\n\nreasonable conduct.\u201d Keller, 819 P.2d at 72\u201373. So the \u201cmere presence of a\n\ngeneral integration clause in an agreement does not bar a claim for negligent or\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Id. at 73. Instead, to \u201ceffect a waiver of a claim\n\nof negligent [or fraudulent] misrepresentation,\u201d the merger clause must\n\n\u201cspecifically prohibit[]\u201d the claim. Id.\n\nOpen asserts that the contract\u2019s merger clause bars the City\u2019s tort claims\n\nbecause it \u201cwas quite specific with its integration of Open\u2019s RFP response into\n\nthe contract and the parties\u2019 disclaimer of extracontractual representations and\n\npromises.\u201d Op. Br. at 23. But the merger clause says nothing about precluding\n\nclaims for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation. See App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15. Though Open is correct that the clause covers the SOW and\n\nfunctionality matrix, the inclusion of those documents \u201cdoes not specifically\n\npreclude\u201d a fraud claim. Keller, 819 P.2d at 73. So the mere fact of a merger\n\nclause \u201cdoes not effect a waiver of [the tort] claim.\u201d Id. And unlike Steak n\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 18\n\nShake Enterprises, Inc. v. Globex Co., LLC, in which the court found that a\n\nmerger clause precluded a fraudulent-inducement claim because it disproved\n\nreliance \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d 110 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1083 (D. Colo. 2015), the\n\nmerger clause here says nothing about reliance. Compare App. vol. 19, at 19\n\n\u00b6 18.15, with Steak n Shake, 110 F. Supp. 3d at 1083 (merger clause stating that\n\nthe \u201cFranchisees were entering into the agreement as a result of their own\n\ninvestigation and not as a result of any representation by Plaintiffs\u201d); see also\n\nApp. vol. 19, at 6 (contract introduction stating that \u201cthe City has proceeded\n\nwith reasonable reliance on Open\u2019s representations\u201d). So the merger clause\n\ndoes not bar the City\u2019s tort claim.\n\nOpen also asserts that the contract\u2019s limited-warranty provisions bar a\n\ntort claim because they \u201cexpressly disclaim[] reliance on precontractual\n\nrepresentations[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 24. Even if that were true (it\u2019s not), Open has\n\nwaived this argument by presenting it for the first time on appeal. 7 See\n Open claims it preserved this argument by \u201cma[king] a cogent and\ncomplete argument . . . discussing the complete and specific integration of the\nfunctionality matrix [and the] specific merger clause\u201d in its post-trial and\nsummary judgment motions, and that circuit precedent does not \u201crequire a\nlisting of every piece of evidence supporting an argument.\u201d Reply Br. at 17\u201318\n(citing Perez v. El Tequila, LLC, 847 F.3d 1247, 1256 (10th Cir. 2017)). But\nOpen misreads Perez. In Perez, we determined that the appellant had preserved\nits issues on appeal because the \u201cRule 50(a) motions contained identical\narguments\u201d as the Rule 50(b) motion. 847 F.3d at 1255\u201356 (emphasis added).\nThough the Rule 50(b) motion \u201cdid not rely upon the exact same facts\u201d as the\nearlier motions, we noted that such \u201ctechnical precision [was] unnecessary.\u201d Id.\n(emphasis added) (citation modified). But here, Open didn\u2019t simply fail to\ninclude certain facts\u2014it failed to include the argument itself.

Sufficient Evidence of Fraud\n\nSecond, Open asserts that we should reverse the jury\u2019s verdict because\n\n\u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence of an actual and actionable material\n\nmisrepresentation.\u201d Op. Br. at 21 (emphasis omitted).\n\n\u201cWhen a jury verdict is challenged on appeal, our review is limited to\n\ndetermining whether the record\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nprevailing party\u2014contains substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nBangert Bros.

Co., 310 F.3d 1278, 1292 (10th\n\nCir. 2002) (citation modified). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something less than the\n\nweight of the evidence, and is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable\n\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if different\n\nconclusions also might be supported by the evidence.\u201d Id. (citation modified).\n\nand (b) motions, Open argued only that \u201cthe economic loss rule and integration\nclause bar the City\u2019s fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims[.]\u201d App. vol.\n5, at 126 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (citation modified); see also App. vol. 6, at 151\n(Rule 50(b) Motion).

Because the parties and the district court focus on mainly the third\n\nmisrepresentation, and because we conclude that there is sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting that the third misrepresentation was fraudulent, we do not discuss\n\nthe other alleged misrepresentations.\n\nA. The Functionality Matrix\n\nThe City contends that \u201c[t]he most striking example of Open\u2019s false\n\nrepresentation was its fraudulent grading of its software in response to the\n\nCity\u2019s RFP in March 2018.\u201d Resp. Br. at 15. In Open\u2019s RFP response, Open\n\ngraded 89.7% of the required functionalities as \u201cA,\u201d or as already existing in\n\nthe current software system. But trial evidence showed that Open had internally\n\ngraded only 59.4% of its functionalities as the equivalent of an \u201cA.\u201d And\n\nbecause the internal grading was never disclosed to the City, the City claims\n\nthat Open\u2019s RFP response fraudulently represented its functionalities.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 21\n\nOpen claims that it accurately graded its functionalities based on the\n\nRFP\u2019s requirements. Below are the RFP\u2019s requirements for an \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d\n\ngrade:\n\nApp. vol. 2, at 3. Open asserts (1) that \u201cunrefuted trial testimony\u201d showed that\n\nOpen\u2019s grading was consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions and (2) that its\n\ninternal assessment cannot sustain the City\u2019s fraud claim because it \u201csorted the\n\nfunctionalities using different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a\n\ndifferent type of internal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39.\n\nAt trial, Open International\u2019s president explained that Open\u2019s grading\n\nwas consistent with the RFP\u2019s instructions because the instructions asked about\n\nfunctionalities in Open International\u2019s base code, not functionalities in a\n\nreleased version of the software. App. vol. 12, at 184\u201385, 189\u201395. And because\n\nan \u201cA\u201d grade meant that the \u201c[d]esired functionality is achieved through\n\nconfiguration,\u201d even an \u201cA\u201d grade required some level of additional work. App.\n\nvol. 2, at 3; App. vol. 12, at 192\u201393; see also App. vol. 11, at 42 (the City\u2019s\n\nthird-party consultant testifying that \u201cconfiguration\u201d involves \u201cfive-plus\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 22\n\nthings\u201d). Open claims that the City\u2019s expert witness corroborated this testimony\n\nby agreeing that Open could grade a functionality as an \u201cA\u201d if that\n\nfunctionality was present in an earlier version of the software (but not the\n\nunreleased Version 8) so long as Open stated that the functionality was in an\n\nearlier version. See App. vol. 11, at 133\u201334. So Open concludes that the\n\nrepresentations were true and cannot support a finding of fraud.\n\nOpen also contends that its internal assessment \u201csorted the functionalities\n\nusing different criteria [than the functional matrix] for a different type of\n\ninternal analysis.\u201d Op. Br. at 39. Below is a summary table of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment:\n\nApp. vol. 22, at 16. At trial, the City argued that the internal assessment\n\nshowed that only 59.4% of the functionalities (the \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d\n\ncategory) should have been given an \u201cA\u201d grade. But Open contends that its\n\ninternal assessment \u201cmerely broke down the RFP\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 grade into two\n\nsubcategories\u201d: \u201c[c]urrent functionalities\u201d and \u201c[p]lanned for 2018.\u201d Reply Br.\n\nat 10. Open International\u2019s president testified that both categories had the\n\nrequired existing base code, but that the functionalities in the \u201c[c]urrent\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 23\n\nfunctionalities\u201d category were already integrated into Version 8 while the\n\nfunctionalities in the \u201c[p]lanned for 2018\u201d category would be integrated later in\n\n2018. App. vol. 12, at 191; see also id. at 194\u201395 (testifying that three of the\n\nfive categories corresponded with an \u201cA\u201d grade, one of the categories\n\ncorresponded with a \u201cB\u201d grade, and one of the categories corresponded with\n\nmultiple grades). Open acknowledges that the City \u201ctried to impeach\u201d its\n\nwitness on this subject but claims that \u201cnothing contradicted his testimony.\u201d\n\nOp. Br. at 40.\n\nBut Open\u2019s testimony was not unrefuted. On cross-examination, the City\n\nshowed the president\u2019s lack of knowledge about the internal document. See\n\nApp. vol. 13, at 29, 31. The president\u2019s deposition testimony differed from his\n\ntrial testimony, and the district court instructed the jury on inconsistent\n\nstatements after the jury asked for guidance. See id. at 261 (\u201cI heard a lot of in-\n\nperson testimony today that was inconsistent with recorded deposition. What\n\nare your instructions for us, the jury, how to deal with that?\u201d). It was the jury\u2019s\n\nrole to \u201cgive [the testimony] such credibility as [it] may think it deserves.\u201d\n\nApp. vol. 14, at 5. Also, the City presented evidence that \u201c[i]ndustry standard is\n\nto provide factual and accurate responses of [the vendor\u2019s] product or solution .\n\n. . at the time of response.\u201d App. vol. 11, at 84 (emphasis added). So we agree\n\nwith the district court that there was a \u201cdispute about what is A [grade] versus\n\nwhat [is] B [grade]\u201d and that it was \u201ccompletely a jury decision to conclude\n\nwhether [Open] was making those representations as to a current fact or a fact\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 24\n\nin effect at the time the product went live[.]\u201d Resp\u2019t Add. at 13. The jury made\n\nits decision and \u201c[w]e do not retry issues, second guess the jury\u2019s decision-\n\nmaking, or assess the credibility of witnesses and determine the weight to be\n\ngiven their testimony.\u201d Stroup v. United Airlines Inc., 26 F.4th 1147, 1157\n\n(10th Cir. 2022) (citation modified).\n\nOpen also asserts that the grades given to the various functionalities in\n\nthe functionality matrix are not actionable misrepresentations because the\n\nparties\u2019 contract stated that the criteria for the matrix and RFP response were\n\n\u201copen to interpretation\u201d and fraud claims cannot \u201crest on articulations of\n\nopinion or belief.\u201d Op. Br. at 38, 41. But Open did not present this argument in\n\nthe district court. See App. vol. 5, at 122\u201324 (Rule 50(a) Motion) (asserting\n\nthat the City had not proven a misrepresentation because \u201cthe functional matrix\n\ninstructions required those functionalities to be delivered at go-live,\u201d not at the\n\ntime Open submitted its RFP response); App. vol. 6, at 147\u201348 (Rule 50(b)\n\nMotion) (\u201cNothing in the RFP requested a vendor to grade its then-existing\n\nsoftware[.]\u201d). So it is waived. See Knowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183.\n\nGiven the conflicting testimony about Open\u2019s internal assessment and its\n\nRFP response, the jury had sufficient evidence to find that Open fraudulently\n\nrepresented its functionalities.\n\nB. Grading a Different Portal\n\nThe City also asserts that the jury could have found fraudulent\n\ninducement because of what Open graded. Despite allegedly knowing on March\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 25\n\n1, 2018, that it planned to stop developing its homegrown portal and instead\n\nuse the Milestone portal, Open still graded its homegrown portal for the RFP\n\nresponse. Open argues that this cannot support a fraud claim because the City\n\nadmitted at trial that it knew before signing the contract that Open International\n\nplanned to use the Milestone portal and because the City had described an early\n\ndemonstration of the portal as being \u201cexactly as expected when we selected\n\nOpen Smartflex.\u201d App. vol. 18, at 177; see also App. vol. 9, at 88\u201389; App. vol.\n\n12, at 196\u201397. Though the City knew that Open International was using the\n\nMilestone portal for the contract, Open International\u2019s president agreed at trial\n\nthat \u201c[n]o one at Open told the City [that Open] did not grade the Milestone\n\nportal in the RFP response[.]\u201d App. vol. 13, at 254\u201355. Again, because there\n\nwas conflicting testimony on this issue, we defer to the jury\u2019s finding. See\n\nKnowlton, 189 F.3d at 1183\u201384 (\u201c[T]he jury has the exclusive function of . . .\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, and reaching ultimate conclusions of\n\nfact[.]\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict finding Open liable\n\nfor fraudulent inducement.\n\nIII. Ability to Rescind\n\nThird, Open asserts that because the City knew of multiple problems with\n\nthe software and its implementation by spring 2020, yet continued to affirm the\n\ncontract, the City waived its right to rescind the contract.\n\n\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable time, but what\n\nconstitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a particular case and\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 26\n\nmust be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d Ralston Oil & Gas Co. v. July Corp.,\n\n719 P.2d 334, 340 (Colo. App. 1985). We review \u201cfindings of fact for clear\n\nerror.\u201d Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 826 (10th Cir. 1993).\n\nA \u201cfinding of fact is not clearly erroneous unless it is without factual support in\n\nthe record, or if the appellate court, after reviewing all the evidence, is left with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Mile High\n\nIndus. v. Cohen, 222 F.3d 845, 854 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation modified).\n\nA. The Waiver Rule\n\nThe district court instructed the jury to find that Open proved \u201cthe\n\naffirmative defense of waiver\u201d if the City \u201ccontinued the project with Open\n\nwith full knowledge of the actual facts when a reasonable person under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances would not have done so.\u201d App. vol. 5, at 166.\n\nThat instruction is based on Elk River Associates v. Huskin, in which a\n\nColorado appellate court explained that \u201c[t]o sustain the defense of ratification\n\nand waiver, it must appear that the defrauded party, with full knowledge of the\n\ntruth respecting the false representations, elected to continue to carry out the\n\nagreement.\u201d 691 P.2d 1148, 1153 (Colo. App. 1984).\n\nBut Open contends that \u201cthe \u2018full knowledge\u2019 requirement comes into\n\nplay only if one elects to affirm the agreement and thereafter continues to carry\n\nit out and receive its benefits, which would then result in a remedy of damages,\n\nnot rescission.\u201d Op. Br. at 36 (citation modified). Open asserts that to waive\n\nrescission, \u201c[i]t is not requisite that the defrauded party shall be acquainted\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 27\n\nwith all the evidence constituting the fraud[.]\u201d Id. at 35 (quoting Gladden v.\n\nGuyer, 426 P.2d 953, 955 (Colo. 1967)). Instead, rescission is waived once a\n\nparty \u201chas evidence sufficient to reasonably actuate him to rescind the\n\ncontract[.]\u201d Id. (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955). So Open concludes that the\n\njury decided only whether the City had waived its ability to recover damages\n\nfor Open\u2019s fraud, not whether the City had waived its ability to rescind the\n\ncontract. 8\n\nWe disagree. As the district court correctly stated, \u201cColorado courts do\n\nnot treat fraudulent inducement waiver and recission waiver as separate claims,\n\ngoverned by different tests[.]\u201d Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *4;\n\naccord Gerbaz v. Hulsey, 288 P.2d 357, 363 (Colo. 1955) (\u201cIf [it] was actually\n\nthe fact [that the plaintiff misrepresented the contract] then defendant was in a\n\nposition to elect, when he discovered the fact, either to rescind the contract, or\n\nto sue for damages[.]\u201d (emphasis added)); Bankers Tr. Co. v. Int\u2019l Tr. Co., 113\n\nP.2d 656, 664 (Colo. 1941) (\u201c[T]he right to rescind and sue [is] waived\u201d if \u201cthe\n\ndefrauded party, with full knowledge, intentionally condoned the fraud,\n\naffirmed the contract and abandoned all right to recover damages.\u201d). A party\n\nwaives the right to rescind when it has full knowledge of the material fact of\n Open\u2019s argument in the district court was a little different. Rather than\nseparating the waiver rules based on two types of remedies (damages and\nrescission), it separated the waiver rules based on whether the plaintiff was\npursuing a claim or seeking a remedy. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934,\nat *3.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 28\n\nthe fraud, even if it does not know all the underlying details of the fraud. See\n\nTisdel v. Cent. Sav. Bank & Tr. Co., 6 P.2d 912, 917 (Colo. 1931) (finding\n\nwaiver because the defendant had \u201cfull knowledge of the falsity of the\n\nrepresentations, and [] all the material facts respecting the same well in mind\u201d\n\n(emphasis added)); Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955 (\u201cThe duty of rescinding arises\n\nimmediately upon acquiring knowledge of the substantial and material facts\n\nconstituting the fraud\u201d and \u201cno subsequent discovery of cumulative evidence\n\ncan operate to execute waiver of the fraud if one has in the meantime occurred,\n\nor to revise a once lost right of rescission.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation\n\nmodified)); see also In re Mascio, 454 B.R. 146, 151 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2011)\n\n(defining \u201cfull knowledge\u201d as \u201cthe substantial and material facts constituting\n\nthe fraud\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Gladden, 426 P.2d at 955)). So a party\n\nneed not elect rescission until \u201che becomes aware of facts or circumstances that\n\nentitle him to a rescission.\u201d Young v. Leech, 240 P. 692, 693 (Colo. 1925); see\n\nGerbaz, 288 P.2d at 363 (\u201c[T]he[] defendant was in a position to elect[] when\n\nhe discovered the fact[.]\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\nOpen claims that it makes sense to have separate waiver rules for\n\nrescission and claims for damages because it \u201cprevent[s] a party from waiting\n\nto see how their contract plays out before deciding whether to rescind or sue for\n\ndamages.\u201d Reply Br. at 19\u201320. But Open never explains why \u201cwaiting to see\n\nhow the[] contract plays out\u201d before suing for damages should be treated\n\ndifferently than \u201cwaiting to see how the[] contract plays out\u201d before rescinding.\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 29\n\nId. Indeed, the point of waiver is to prevent the \u201cwaiting to see how the[]\n\ncontract plays out\u201d part. See Stoner v. Marshall, 358 P.2d 1021, 1023 (Colo.\n\n1961) (\u201c[The] election [of rescission or damages] must be promptly made . . .\n\notherwise one might, with knowledge of fraud, speculate upon the advantages\n\nor disadvantages of an agreement, receive its benefits, and thereafter repudiate\n\nall its obligations.\u201d (citation modified)). Though Open is correct that many\n\ncases the City and the district court cite involve claims for damages instead of\n\nrescission, it has not persuasively explained why that matters. Regardless of the\n\nremedy, the question is whether the party waived its right to recovery by acting\n\nlike everything was okay under the contract and then turning around and\n\nseeking recovery for the very conduct it chose to ignore.\n\nSo the district court properly instructed the jury on waiver, and we now\n\nconsider whether the finding that the City did not waive its right to rescind the\n\ncontract was clearly erroneous.\n\nB. No Waiver\n\nThe jury found that the City did not waive its right to recover for Open\u2019s\n\nfraudulent inducement. And the district court accepted that factual finding. See\n\nOpen Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *3\u20134. Because this finding has factual\n\nsupport in the record, it was not clearly erroneous. See Cohen, 222 F.3d at 854;\n\ncf. Ralston Oil & Gas Co., 719 P.2d at 340 (holding that the trial court\u2019s\n\nconclusion \u201cthat plaintiff did not unreasonably delay seeking rescission of the\n\ncontract\u201d was \u201camply supported by the record\u201d).\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 30\n\nOpen contends that the City knew these facts by spring 2020: (1) that the\n\nsoftware was untested and had not been installed for any other customer,\n\n(2) that the customer portal was not satisfactory and was not the portal\n\nrepresented during the vendor-selection process, (3) that the software\u2019s\n\nfunctionalities were only 58% of the required functionalities, and (4) that there\n\nwere significant issues with Open International\u2019s product. And Open asserts\n\nthat despite this knowledge, the City agreed to PCR 19, which was meant to\n\naddress the issues with the software and deliver complete functionality, and\n\nthus affirmed the contract and waived rescission.\n\nBut Open continues to conflate the problems with its software with its\n\nfraudulent precontractual representations; knowledge of these problems is not\n\nthe same as knowledge of fraud. Though the jury could have inferred\n\nknowledge of fraud based on knowledge of the above facts, it was not required\n\nto do so. The City\u2019s CFO testified that realizing Open\u2019s misrepresentations\n\n\u201cwas a gradual process\u201d and that the \u201cfunctional matrix work was the point in\n\ntime where [the CFO] said I think we may have gotten swindled.\u201d App. vol. 7,\n\nat 108. And there was evidence that the City did not learn of Open\u2019s internal\n\nassessment of the functionality matrix until discovery. See App. vol. 13, at\n\n254\u201355. So there was at least conflicting evidence about when the City\n\ndiscovered the fraud.\n\nOpen criticizes the City\u2019s CFO\u2019s testimony as \u201cconclusory, self-serving,\n\nand self-contradictory[.]\u201d Reply Br. at 21. But it was the jury\u2019s role to assess\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 31\n\nthe witnesses\u2019 credibility and weigh the evidence. See Bankers Trust Co., 113\n\nP.2d at 664 (\u201c[Q]uestions as to the time when plaintiff first discovered the\n\nfraud . . . are questions of fact for resolution by a jury.\u201d); Ralston Oil & Gas\n\nCo., 719 P.2d at 340 (\u201cA party must rescind a contract within a reasonable\n\ntime, but what constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts of a\n\nparticular case and must be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d).

Open Investments\u2019 Liability\n\nFinally, Open challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion that argued that Open Investments could not be liable for rescission (a\n\ntort remedy) because it was only a guarantor of the contract and thus liable only\n\nfor contract damages. Alternatively, it argued that even if Open Investments\n\ncould be liable for rescission, there was insufficient evidence that Open\n\nInvestments made a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. 9 But we agree\n Open complains that the City \u201ceschewed\u201d its burden to prove each\ndefendant\u2019s liability \u201cby sleight-of-hand, using \u2018Open\u2019 as a trial shorthand to\nrefer to both defendants collectively.\u201d Op. Br. at 42. But in the district court,\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 32\n\nwith the district court that Open has long waived this argument. See Open Int\u2019l,\n\nLLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *5 (\u201c[T]his argument disclaiming any liability of\n\nOpen Investments comes far too late.\u201d).\n\nOpen argued for the first time in its Rule 50(b) motion, one month after\n\nthe jury had been dismissed, that Open Investments could not be held liable for\n\nthe rescission remedy. See App. vol. 17, at 176 (Q: \u201cPrior to your Rule 50[b]\n\nmotion, had this issue ever been brought up?\u201d A: \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t think it\n\nwas brought up until the election of remedies[.]\u201d). Because Open failed to make\n\nthis argument in its Rule 50(a) motion, and because the City objected to this\n\nnew argument, the issue is waived and we will not consider it on appeal. 10 See\n\nall parties consistently referred to Open International and Open Investments\ncollectively as \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cDefendants.\u201d See e.g., Supp. App. vol. 1, at 50\u201385\n(Open\u2019s Partial Motion for Summ. J.); App. vol. 2, at 184\u2013224 (Final Pretrial\nOrder); App. vol. 4, at 1\u20132 (Open\u2019s Motion to Compel Election of Remedies);\nApp. vol. 5, at 118\u201340 (Open\u2019s Rule 50(a) Motion); App. vol. 7, at 25 (Open\u2019s\nOpening Statement) (\u201cNow, who is Open? Open is not just one company, as the\njudge mentioned.\u201d). And Open never objected to the jury instructions or to the\nverdict form that referred to \u201cOpen\u201d collectively.\n Open asserts three reasons why its argument would not be waived.\nFirst, it repeats its earlier argument that \u201ctechnical precision [between Rule\n50(a) and Rule 50(b) motions] is unnecessary[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 43 (quoting Perez,\n847 F.3d at 1256). We reject that argument for the same reason we rejected it\nabove\u2014Open failed to make the argument in its motion. See Perez, 847 F.3d at\n1255\u201356. Second, Open claims that its argument is not waived under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 46, which provides that \u201c[f]ailing to object does not\nprejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was\nmade.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 46. But Open doesn\u2019t assert that it had no opportunity to\nobject; it asserts that \u201cthere was no reason for Open Investments to object[.]\u201d\nOp. Br. at 47 (emphasis added). So Rule 46 does not save Open\u2019s argument.\nThird, Open contends that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(5) preserves\n (footnote continued)\n\f Appellate Case: 24-1152 Document: 79-1 Date Filed: 07/23/2025 Page: 33\n\nTherrien v. Target Corp., 617 F.3d 1242, 1250 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010)\n\n(\u201cOrdinarily a party cannot raise in a Rule 50(b) motion an argument not\n\nalready raised in its Rule 50(a) motion. But on appeal we can consider such an\n\nargument when the opposing party failed to object to the Rule 50(b) motion for\n\nraising new arguments.\u201d (citation modified)). So we affirm the district court\u2019s\n\ndenial of Open\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion on this issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s denial of Open\u2019s\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nits claim. But Rule 52(a)(5)\u2019s directive that \u201c[a] party may later question the\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the [court\u2019s] findings, whether or not the\nparty . . . objected to them\u201d is reserved for nonjury trials. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a)(1) (\u201cIn General. In an action tried on the facts without a jury . . . the\ncourt must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law\nseparately.\u201d); see also Johnson v. Raemisch, 779 F. App\u2019x 507, 518 n.10 (10th\nCir. 2019) (\u201cRule 52 governs bench trials[.]\u201d). Though the restitution amount\nwas decided by the court, the issue Open challenges here\u2014its liability\u2014was\ntried before a jury. See Open Int\u2019l, LLC, 2024 WL 1239934, at *1\u20132. So Rule\n52 offers Open no help either. Open waived its argument.\n\n33"

The Older Americans\nAct (OAA) establishes funding mechanisms and an adminis-\ntrative framework to help states provide healthcare, housing,\nand community services for older persons. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001 et\nseq. States must jump through several hoops before securing\nOAA funding, including submitting a state plan, designating\n\f2 No. 23-2788\n\na state agency, and geographically dividing the state into dis-\ntinct planning and service areas. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027; 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(1). Then, for each service area, states must designate\na \u201cpublic or private nonprofit \u2026 as the area agency.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3025(a)(2). At the heart of this case is whether those \u201carea\nagencies\u201d can sue to enforce OAA provisions and related Illi-\nnois state laws.\n One such area agency, the Northwestern Illinois Area\nAgency on Aging (NIAAA), filed state and federal suits\nagainst Paula Basta, the former Director of the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA). NIAAA\u2019s lawsuits alleged that Basta,\nin her personal and official capacities, deprived it and others\nof rights guaranteed by Illinois law and the OAA. Specifically,\nthe lawsuits alleged that Basta unlawfully refused to hold\nhearings on three administrative petitions that NIAAA filed.\n Ultimately, NIAAA lost both suits. The Illinois Supreme\nCourt first ruled in Basta\u2019s favor. Then, the federal district\ncourt dismissed NIAAA\u2019s suit on the grounds that it was\ntime-barred and failed to state a claim. After requesting entry\nof a final judgment, NIAAA brought this appeal raising a host\nof issues.\n We find no error and affirm across the board.\n\nI\n\nWe begin with the facts. At the pleadings stage, we accept\nall well-pled facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw\nall reasonable inferences in NIAAA's favor. Gociman v. Loyola\nUniv. of Chicago, 41 F.4th 873, 878 (7th Cir. 2022).\n\fNo. 23-2788 3\n\nA. Administrative Background\n\nAs noted above, the Older Americans Act (OAA) requires\nstates to take certain steps to designate area agencies respon-\nsible for providing services to senior citizens. Should states\nfail to comply with those requirements, the federal govern-\nment can take remedial measures, such as terminating fund-\ning. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3027(d). Area agencies, in turn, serve\nas the \u201cpublic advocate[s] for the development or enhance-\nment of comprehensive and coordinated community-based\nsystems of services in each community throughout and spe-\ncific to each planning and service area.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1321.61(a);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3025(b)(5). Area agencies must develop a\nplan to provide services within their designated area and then\nsubmit that plan to state authorities. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3026(a).\n The Illinois Act on Aging designates the Illinois Depart-\nment on Aging (IDA) as the \u201csingle State agency for receiving\nand disbursing federal funds made available under the \u2018Older\nAmericans Act.\u2019\u201d 20 ILCS 105/4. The IDA is responsible for\ncomplying with the OAA\u2019s provisions and \u201c[a]ssisting area\nagencies on aging in the development of comprehensive and\ncoordinated service delivery systems throughout the State.\u201d\n89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.10(a)(4). NIAAA is one such agency,\nwhich the IDA assigned to cover the state\u2019s nine northwest-\nernmost counties. Although an independent nonprofit,\nNIAAA receives more than ninety percent of its funding from\nthe IDA.\n Previously, Illinois regulations required the IDA to pro-\nvide agencies like NIAAA an opportunity for a hearing when\nthe IDA \u201cpropose[d] to disapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan \u2026 or withdraw from the agency\n\f4 No. 23-2788\n\ndesignation as an [area agency],\u201d when \u201cany eligible appli-\ncant for designation as a planning and service area under the\nprovisions of [the Act]\u201d has been denied, or for \u201cany nutrition\nproject that an area agency proposes to defund.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 215 N.E.3d 935, 948 (Ill. 2022) (citing 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n\u00a7 230.410 amended at 5 Ill. Reg. 3722 (eff. Mar. 31, 1981), re-\nnumbered at 7 Ill. Reg. 5178 (eff. July 27, 1983)). That regula-\ntion was amended effective August 2021. Under the amend-\nment, a hearing is to be provided to an area agency when the\nIDA proposes to: \u201c(A) [d]isapprove the area plan or any\namendment to the area plan that has been submitted to the\n[IDA] by the [area agency]; or (B) [r]eject the [area agency\u2019s]\nrecommendation to designate a service provider.\u201d 89 Ill. Ad-\nmin. Code \u00a7 230.450(a)(1) (\u201c2021 Hearing Rule\u201d). The IDA\nalso has the right to \u201cconduct administrative hearings for\nother appeal requests concerning the health, safety and wel-\nfare of older individuals.\u201d 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 230.450(b).\n\nB. The Underlying Disputes\n\nIn June 2019, NIAAA requested an administrative hearing\n(\u201cInitial Petition\u201d) with the IDA. The petition presented two\ngrievances and requested findings that the IDA violated the\nIllinois Administrative Procedure Act, 5 ILCS 100/1\u20131 et seq.,\nby withholding funds from it, and that the Department also\nviolated Illinois law.\n The first grievance NIAAA aired in its Initial Petition\nstemmed from the fallout that occurred when NIAAA de-\ncided that the IDA\u2019s Adult Protective Services (APS) Manual\nwas invalid and ought to be recalled. In July 2013, NIAAA\nreached out to the IDA\u2019s then-director, John Holton, raising\nconcerns about the manual. Months later, Holton sent\n\fNo. 23-2788 5\n\nNIAAA a letter advising that the IDA was terminating\nNIAAA\u2019s FY2014 Adult Protective Services (APS) Grant, ef-\nfective January 2014. Fast forward to 2019. In April of that\nyear, the petition alleged, NIAAA\u2019s director and general\ncounsel, Grant Nyhammer, was told by an IDA employee that\nthe employee had been \u201cgiven an order [to] withhold funding\nfrom [NIAAA] to retaliate for [its] advocacy.\u201d Later that\nmonth, as outlined in the petition, Nyhammer asked Basta via\nemail to \u201cinvestigate funding being withheld\u201d from NIAAA.\nBasta responded that she could not speak to practices preced-\ning her tenure as director.\n From this emerged the second grievance NIAAA pre-\nsented in the Initial Petition\u2014that the IDA had refused\nNIAAA\u2019s administrative hearing request. The IDA denied the\nInitial Petition because it did not present a \u201ccontested case\u201d as\ndefined in the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act and\ntherefore did not require a hearing.\n Two months after submitting the Initial Petition, NIAAA\nsubmitted a second petition (\u201cAPS Petition\u201d) in August 2019.\nThe APS Petition raised grievances about events after the fil-\ning of the Initial Petition. This second petition requested a\nhearing and alleged that the IDA had improperly rejected\nNIAAA\u2019s designation of APS providers. As background, two\nmonths earlier, in June, NIAAA had designated APS provid-\ners for its service agency. The next month, the IDA responded\nthat the IDA was \u201cexercising its right to reject the [provider]\nrecommendations\u201d because of \u201cvarious deficiencies in the un-\nderlying [r]equest.\u201d NIAAA\u2019s APS Petition followed, which\nthe IDA denied by letter in September 2019. The letter in-\nformed NIAAA that the IDA \u201cis unable to provide a hearing\n\f6 No. 23-2788\n\nbecause the [APS Petition] fails to present a contested case\nthat would support the right to an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d\n Two years after its first two petitions were denied, NIAAA\nsubmitted a third petition (\u201cState Plan Appeal\u201d). This peti-\ntion, sent in September 2021, alleged that the IDA\u2019s state plan\nfor 2022\u20132024 did not comply with the OAA\u2019s regulations.\nLike the first two petitions, the third petition requested an ad-\nministrative hearing. In December 2021, the IDA responded\nwith a letter dismissing the petition because 89 Ill. Adm. Code\n230.420(d) only permitted area agency appeals in two limited\nand inapplicable circumstances.\n\nC. Court Proceedings\n\nOn November 5, 2019, NIAAA filed a complaint for man-\ndamus in Winnebago County Circuit Court. The state trial\ncourt denied relief, but the state appellate court reversed with\ninstructions for the IDA to conduct hearings on both the Ini-\ntial Petition and APS Petition. In its order remanding the mat-\nter, the appellate court concluded that the IDA\u2019s \u201csummary\ndismissals of [NIAAA\u2019s] petitions and its conclusory state-\nments that the petitions failed to present contested cases were\ninsufficient for meaningful judicial review.\u201d Nyhammer v.\nBasta, 188 N.E.3d 1283, 1290 (Ill. App. Ct. 2022). The appellate\ncourt also held that the IDA was \u201crequired to give [NIAAA]\nadjudicatory hearings and determine the merits of its peti-\ntions.\u201d Id. at 1292. The case then made its way to the Illinois\nSupreme Court which disagreed with the state appellate court\nand, instead, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing\nthe mandamus complaint. Nyhammer v. Basta, 215 N.E.3d 935\n(Ill. 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 2497 (2023).\n\fNo. 23-2788 7\n\nHaving lost its administrative and state court challenges,\nNIAAA proceeded to federal court. On February 28, 2022,\nNIAAA filed a complaint against Paula Basta in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois. NIAAA pleaded ten causes of action\nagainst Basta in its First Amended Complaint: five in her per-\nsonal capacity (Counts I\u2013V) and five in her official capacity\n(Counts VI\u2013X). The allegations at issue in this appeal are as\nfollows:\n Count I: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s hearing rights under the\n OAA;\n Count II: the dismissal of the State Plan Appeal\n violated NIAAA\u2019s right to function as a public\n advocate as defined by the OAA;\n Count III: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n Initial Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count IV: the refusal to provide a hearing on the\n APS Petition violated the Fourteenth Amend-\n ment\u2019s due process guarantees;\n Count V: the IDA\u2019s regulation on hearings (as\n amended and codified under 89 Ill. Admin.\n Code \u00a7 230.410, which the parties refer to as the\n \u201cHearing Rule\u201d) denies NIAAA its right to a\n hearing under the OAA and thereby deprives\n NIAAA of due process.\nCounts I\u2013V were brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Counts VI\u2013\nX involved pendant state law claims. NIAAA sought dam-\nages in excess of $75,000, attorneys\u2019 fees, and declaratory\njudgments that (1) Basta unlawfully failed to provide\n\f8 No. 23-2788\n\nhearings on NIAAA\u2019s three petitions, (2) Basta violated due\nprocess, OAA, and state law rights, and (3) the Hearing Rule\nis invalid under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.\n In response, Basta filed a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). That motion\nalleged that NIAAA had not shown: (A) \u201cany property right\nin an administrative hearing pursuant to due process [or] the\nOlder Americans Act\u201d; (B) a clearly established right that had\nbeen violated to defeat qualified immunity to bar Counts I\u2013V;\n(C) why sovereign immunity would not bar Counts VI\u2013X; (D)\nwhy the statute of limitations would not bar Counts III and\nIV; (E) what standing NIAAA has to bring Counts VII\u2013VIII on\nbehalf of older adults and organizations. After full briefing on\nthat motion, the district court entered an order dismissing\nNIAAA\u2019s complaint without prejudice. The order invited\nNIAAA to file an amended complaint, but NIAAA instead\nfiled a motion for entry of a final judgment. The district court\ngranted that motion, and this appeal followed.\n\nII\n\nWith those facts established, we turn to NIAAA\u2019s chal-\nlenge to the district court order granting the motion to dis-\nmiss. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim. Gociman, 41 F.4th at 881. And we may affirm a dismis-\nsal on any basis supported by the record. Thomas v. Dart, 39\nF.4th 835, 840 (7th Cir. 2022).\n Recall, the district court dismissed all of NIAAA\u2019s federal\nclaims (Counts I\u2013V) for three reasons: (1) the statute of limita-\ntions barred claims arising from the IDA\u2019s denials of\nNIAAA\u2019s Initial Petition and APS Petition; (2) NIAAA lacked\n\fNo. 23-2788 9\n\nany property interest deprived by the IDA without due pro-\ncess; and (3) the OAA provisions at issue did not clearly man-\nifest an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights en-\nforceable by NIAAA via \u00a7 1983. On appeal, NIAAA chal-\nlenges all three reasons. We review each in turn.\n\nA. Statute of Limitations\n\nAs a threshold matter, NIAAA argues that the district\ncourt improperly considered the statute of limitations when\nruling on Basta\u2019s motion to dismiss. Specifically, NIAAA\nclaims that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense\nand therefore must be raised in an answer, not a motion to\ndismiss. That is incorrect. In Talevski ex rel. Talevski, our court\ndid indeed caution that \u201cthe proper way to raise a limitations\ndefense is in the answer, as an affirmative defense.\u201d Talevski\nex rel. Talevski v. Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty., 6 F.4th\n713, 721 (7th Cir. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Health & Hosp. Corp. of\nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023) (emphasis added)\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). But in that very case, we also\nacknowledged two other ways that the defense can be raised:\n(1) in a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(c); or (2) in a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in the rare circumstance where \u201cthe\ncomplaint alone alleges enough facts to eliminate all doubt\nabout timeliness.\u201d Id. Here, there was no factual dispute as to\ntimeliness, only a legal one. The parties do not dispute when\nthe underlying facts occurred, and the timing of those events\nwas adequately alleged in the complaint. Instead, they dis-\npute whether the timing of those events meant that related\nclaims were barred as a matter of law. Thus, the district court\n\f10 No. 23-2788\n\nwas right to consider Basta\u2019s statute of limitations argument\nwhen ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n With this threshold matter settled, we consider whether\nthe statute of limitations legally barred the claims at issue\nhere. We have previously held that \u201csection 1983 claims aris-\ning in Illinois are governed by a two-year statute of limita-\ntions.\u201d Kelly v. City of Chicago, 4 F.3d 509, 511 (7th Cir. 1993).\nIn Kelly, we made three important observations: (1) courts\nlook to the personal injury laws of the state where the injury\noccurred to determine the statute of limitations in a \u00a7 1983\ncase; (2) federal law governs the accrual of claims for these\npurposes; and (3) courts apply the tolling laws of the state\nwhere the injury occurred. Id. These rules and principles\nguide us in answering two questions. We first ask when the\nclaims accrued. We then ask whether the limitations period\nwas tolled.\n As we observed in Kelly, the general standard for the ac-\ncrual question is that \u00a7 1983 claims \u201caccrue when the plaintiff\nknows or should know that his or her constitutional rights\nhave been violated.\u201d Id. (quoting Wilson v. Giesen, 956 F.2d\n738, 740 (7th Cir. 1992)). In this case, the two relevant petition\ndenials were discrete events that both occurred by September\n2019. It is difficult to imagine how NIAAA would not or\nshould not have known of the injuries it suffered as a result of\nthose denials in September 2019. And NIAAA does not pre-\nsent any support for an alternative conclusion. In its appellate\nbriefing, NIAAA does not directly challenge Basta\u2019s argu-\nment about when NIAAA\u2019s claims accrued. Thus, NIAAA\nhas waived any argument that the claims accrued after Sep-\ntember 2019. See Cent. States, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v.\nMidwest Motor Express, Inc., 181 F.3d 799, 808 (7th Cir. 1999)\n\fNo. 23-2788 11\n\n(\u201cArguments not developed in any meaningful way are\nwaived.\u201d).\n NIAAA does argue, however, that its state court litigation\ntolled the limitations period. Illinois law does not support this\nargument. NIAAA points us to the Illinois continuing tort\ndoctrine, under which the limitations period is \u201ctolled\u201d for\ncontinuing violations. Despite courts occasionally using the\nword \u201ctoll\u201d when applying the doctrine, the Illinois continu-\ning tort doctrine governs only the point at which a claim ac-\ncrues. See Pitts v. City of Kankakee, Ill., 267 F.3d 592, 595 (7th\nCir. 2001) (\u201cThe continuing violation doctrine is \u2026 best char-\nacterized as a doctrine governing the accrual of a claim.\u201d); see\nalso Heard v. Sheahan, 253 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he\ncorrect characterization of the [Illinois] doctrine of continuing\nviolation is that it is a doctrine governing accrual, \u2026 not a toll-\ning doctrine[.]\u201d (citations omitted)); Powell v. City of Danville,\n625 N.E.2d 830, 831 (Ill. 1993) (\u201cThere are situations where the\ntortious conduct is continuing, and the limitations period be-\ngins on the date of the last injury (the date the tortious acts\ncease).\u201d). Thus, NIAAA has not offered, nor have we found,\nany authority to support NIAAA\u2019s position that its state court\nlitigation tolled the statute of limitations for its federal claims.\n For these reasons, we find that the relevant claims accrued\nby September 2019\u2014more than two years before NIAAA filed\nits complaint in federal court in February 2022\u2014and were not\ntolled for any period. Accordingly, we affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s ruling that NIAAA\u2019s claims \u201carising from the denials\nof the Initial Petition and the APS Petition are barred by the\nstatute of limitations.\u201d Nw. Ill. Area Agency on Aging v. Basta,\n3:22-cv-50070, 2023 WL 6057263, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 16, 2023).\n\f12 No. 23-2788\n\nB. Deprivation of Property Rights Without Due Process\n\nAlthough the statute of limitations problem is sufficient to\naffirm the dismissal of NIAAA\u2019s claims about the denial of\nthe Initial and APS Petitions, it does not support dismissal of\nthe State Plan Appeal claims. Therefore, we next consider\nwhether those claims implicate NIAAA\u2019s due process rights.\n NIAAA argues that Illinois state law establishes property\nrights enforceable under \u00a7 1983. But this is hard to square with\nthe fact that Illinois\u2019 highest court determined that Illinois\nstate law does not create such rights, at least regarding the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion. In Nyhammer, the Illinois Supreme Court considered the\nIDA\u2019s denial of hearings on the Initial Petition and APS Peti-\ntion and held:\n Here, NIAAA makes no argument that it has a\n life or liberty interest in the subjects of its peti-\n tions for hearing. Thus, the only potentially ap-\n plicable interest NIAAA could have in the fund-\n ing or service provider designation for which it\n seeks a hearing from the Department is a prop-\n erty interest. However, to have a property inter-\n est, there must be more than a unilateral expec-\n tation of the funding or approval of its service\n provider designations. Rather, NIAAA must\n show a legitimate claim of entitlement to the\n funding or service provider designation for\n which it seeks a hearing.\n Applying these principles to the case at bar, we\n cannot say that NIAAA has a constitutionally\n protected property interest because NIAAA has\n\fNo. 23-2788 13\n\nnot alleged facts explaining how, under objec-\n tively ascertainable criteria set forth in the law\n that limits the Department's discretion in some\n way, it is entitled to the \u201cother funding\u201d or ser-\n vice provider designation approval that it seeks.\n215 N.E.3d at 950 (citations omitted).\n We see no reason why the denial of the hearing requested\nin NIAAA\u2019s State Plan Appeal\u2014which was not before the Il-\nlinois Supreme Court\u2014would have involved property rights\ncreated by state law where the first two denials did not. In its\nbriefing, the NIAAA notes that the third petition cited two\nagency regulations, but those would have also applied to the\nfirst two petitions, as would the Illinois Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. Thus, in accordance with the Illinois Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Nyhammer, we affirm the district court\u2019s\nholding that NIAAA has failed to plausibly allege a due pro-\ncess violation. See Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Miscevic, 880 F.3d\n927, 934 (7th Cir. 2018) (\u201cWe must defer to a state court\u2019s in-\nterpretation of the state\u2019s statute.\u201d) (cleaned).\n C. The OAA & Section 1983\n\nOn the question of whether the OAA creates rights en-\nforceable under \u00a7 1983, NIAAA asks us to reach the same re-\nsult that the Supreme Court did in Health & Hospital Corp. of\nMarion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023). As we recently\nobserved, the Supreme Court in Talevski provided a twofold\ntest to analyze whether a Spending Clause statute creates a\nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983. Saint Anthony Hosp. v. White-\nhorn, 132 F.4th 962, 970\u201371 (7th Cir. 2025) (citing Talevski, 599\nU.S. at 180\u2013183); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl.,\n145 S. Ct. 2219, 2229\u201334 (2025) (clarifying the analysis). The\n\f14 No. 23-2788\n\nfirst part of that analysis asks whether Congress \u201cunambigu-\nously conferred individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries\nto which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183\n(cleaned). If we answer that question in the affirmative, then\nthe second part of the Talevski analysis asks whether Congress\nintended to preclude the enforcement of those individual\nrights via \u00a7 1983. Id. at 186.\n Applying that two-part approach in Talevski, the Court\nconcluded that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act\u2019s\n(FNHRA) unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice pro-\nvisions \u201cunambiguously\u201d conferred such rights to nursing\nhome residents. Id. at 184 (citing Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S.\n273, 284 (2002)). The nursing home residents cleared the first\nhurdle because the provisions at issue spoke specifically in\nterms of individual rights. Id. at 184\u201386. And the defendants\ncould not rebut the resulting presumption\u2014that is, that the\nindividual rights Congress created in the FNHRA could be\nenforced via \u00a7 1983\u2014because enforcement under \u00a7 1983 was\ncompatible with the enforcement scheme provided for in the\nFNHRA. Id. at 187\u201391.\n Here, the district court determined that the OAA differs\nfrom the FNHRA in both relevant respects. At the first step of\nthe Talevski analysis, we \u201cemploy traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Here, those tools leave\nus without the necessary conviction that the OAA provisions\nat issue in this case create individual rights enforceable by\nNIAAA. So, we need not reach the second part of the analysis.\n Starting with \u00a7 3027 of the OAA, we conclude that this pro-\nvision does not create an individual right enforceable under\n\u00a7 1983 for three reasons.\n\fNo. 23-2788 15\n\nFirst, the context of \u00a7 3027 militates against this determi-\nnation. Although the OAA speaks to older Americans\u2019 \u201centi-\ntlements\u201d generally, \u00a7 3027 was not enacted to secure those\nentitlements per se, but to regulate federal funding related to\nthose entitlements. An indicator of that purpose, for example,\nis the remedy the section provides for noncompliance. See\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981)\n(\u201c[T]he typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally\nimposed conditions is not a private cause of action for non-\ncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to\nterminate funds to the State.\u201d). Here, that remedy is the ter-\nmination of funds to non-compliant states. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3027(d) (\u201cDiscontinuance of Payments\u201d).\n Second, \u00a7 3027 does not identify area agencies specifically\nor older persons more generally as the benefited class.\nWhereas the FNHRA\u2019s relevant provisions spoke directly to\nnursing home residents\u2019 needs and welfare, \u00a7 3027 speaks\nonly in terms of the states. It deals with giving funds to states,\nwithholding those funds from states, allowing states to appeal\nfindings made by the federal government, the notice afforded\nto states, and the limitations of states\u2019 power.\n Third, no provision of \u00a7 3027 specifically confers rights to\nresidents. Although it requires detailed state plans targeted at\nspecific services, \u00a7 3027 governs neither how those services\nare to be administered nor what individual rights (if any) the\nservices are intended to secure. This differs from the FNHRA\nprovisions at issue in Talevski which required nursing homes\nto protect \u201ctransfer and discharge rights\u201d and \u201cprotect and\npromote the right to be free from any physical or chemical re-\nstraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience\nand not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\u201d\n\f16 No. 23-2788\n\nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (emphasis in original) (cleaned)\n(citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1369r(c)(2)); see also\nMedina, 145 S. Ct. at 2234 (\u201c[T]he statutes at issue in Talevski\nsupply the only reliable yardstick against which to measure\nwhether spending-power legislation confers a privately en-\nforceable right.\u201d). Indeed, there is no mention of individual\n\u201crights,\u201d \u201cprivileges,\u201d \u201cimmunities,\u201d or any similar language,\nin \u00a7 3027.\n As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, \u00a7 1983 per-\nmits plaintiffs \u201cto sue for violations of federal spending-\npower statutes only in \u2018atypical\u2019 situations \u2026.\u201d Medina, 145 S.\nCt. at 2239 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). For the three rea-\nsons discussed above, we are left unconvinced that \u00a7 3027 is\nthe sort of \u201catypical\u201d provision contemplated in Talevski.\n Turning to \u00a7 3026(f)(2) of the OAA, we see no reason to\nengage in the Talevski analysis. This is because, even if the pro-\nvision could be enforced via \u00a7 1983, NIAAA failed to state a\nclaim against Basta. Recall, NIAAA claimed that \u00a7 3026(f)(2)\nrequired the IDA to hold a hearing on the withheld funding\nat issue in the Initial Petition. Yet the defendant, Basta, played\nno role in that affair. As the district court noted, \u201cthere are no\nallegations from which it can plausibly be inferred that [Basta]\never made any decision to withhold OAA funding.\u201d Basta,\n2023 WL 6057263 at *5. In the Initial Petition, NIAAA alleged\nonly that Basta\u2019s predecessor withheld funds without first\ngranting a hearing. So, even if \u00a7 3026(f)(2) does create rights\nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u2014a question that we do not consider\ntoday\u2014NIAAA fails to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.\n\fNo. 23-2788 17\n\nHaving followed the approach set forth in Talevski, we af-\nfirm the district court\u2019s ruling that none of the relevant OAA\nprovisions create a right enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\n\nIII\n\nIn conclusion, we find that the district court correctly de-\ncided the due process, \u00a7 1983, and statute of limitations issues\nNIAAA raises, and properly granted the motion to dismiss.\nBecause we affirm on those grounds, we do not reach the\nquestion of qualified immunity. See Hicks v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corr.,\n109 F.4th 895, 900 (7th Cir. 2024).\n The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED."

In the present case, the plaintiff broker contends that it had an exclusive agreement to secure certain financing on behalf of the defendant and that it was entitled to a commission even though it was not the procuring cause of a loan the defendant ultimately obtained. For the reasons that follow, we determine that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the transaction at issue and, therefore, we affirm the order appealed from.</p><p><i>Factual and Procedural Background</i></p>\n<p>In June 2020, the defendant, Aurora Properties, LLC, entered into an agreement with the plaintiff, Angelic Real Estate, LLC, a licensed real estate broker specializing in obtaining financing for commercial properties, for the plaintiff to secure certain financing on the defendant's behalf. The two-page letter agreement dated June 8, 2020 (hereinafter the agreement), stated that the defendant was engaging the plaintiff \"exclusively\" to obtain debt financing for multiple office buildings located in Tennessee. Under the \"scope\" provision of the agreement, the plaintiff was to \"assist [the defendant] in identifying, soliciting proposals from, and negotiating with financing providers for debt for the Properties.\" The scope provision set forth the terms of the defendant's desired loan and further provided, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p>\"[I]f under this Agreement [the plaintiff] does not secure, on or before June 20, 2020, one or more written quotes or terms sheets from lenders [with the desired terms], this Agreement shall remain in place but shall become non-exclusive with regards to any lenders not already approached and engaged by [the plaintiff]. In such instance, [the plaintiff] shall provide [the defendant] a list of its protected lenders it has gone to for the Properties . . . by the end of the next business day. Should [the plaintiff] subsequent to that date secure such terms with a lender on the [list], or with another [*2]lender who has not already provided a terms sheet to [the defendant], either directly or via another intermediary, the exclusivity clause of this Agreement shall be reinstated.\"</p>\n<p>The term of the agreement was 120 days from June 8, 2020. Pursuant to the agreement, if the defendant came to an agreement on terms for financing, the plaintiff was to be paid a fee at the closing of each funding pursuant to a specified fee scale. The agreement also contained an \"Exclusion\" provision, which stated that the above-referenced fee would not apply to a loan with three specified lenders, including Mountain Commerce Bank (hereinafter MCB), \"provided a terms sheet is signed with one of them on or before June 30, 2020.\"</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2020, the defendant obtained a $16,750,000 loan commitment from MCB. The plaintiff allegedly informed the defendant that if MCB entered into a terms sheet before the expiration of the agreement and after the exclusion period, i.e., June 30, 2020, the plaintiff would be entitled to a fee under the agreement. The defendant subsequently closed on the loan with MCB and did not tender a fee to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>In November 2020, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover the fee allegedly due under the agreement. The plaintiff subsequently moved for summary judgment on the complaint. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that the terms of the agreement were clear and unambiguous and granted the plaintiff the exclusive right to secure debt financing on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff argued that since the agreement was exclusive, it was entitled to a fee as long as the defendant obtained financing during the life of the agreement, regardless of whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the financing. The plaintiff further argued that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB outlined in the agreement, that exclusion period expired on June 30, 2020, nearly two months before the defendant entered into a terms sheet with MCB.</p>\n<p>The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendant contended, among other things, that the agreement contained no clear and express language that a fee was owed regardless of the defendant independently negotiating its own terms. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff therefore was not entitled to a fee in connection with the defendant's loan from MCB, as there was no dispute the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of that loan.</p>\n<p>In an order dated October 11, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's motion and granted the defendant's cross-motion. The court determined, inter alia, that notwithstanding the fact the agreement's exclusion provision expired on June 30, 2020, given the lack of clear exclusivity in the agreement, the plaintiff was not entitled to receive a fee for a loan negotiated and secured solely by the defendant.</p>\n<p>This appeal by the plaintiff ensued.</p><p><i>Legal Analysis</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues on appeal, as it did before the Supreme Court, that it is entitled to a fee in connection with the MCB transaction because the agreement with the defendant was exclusive, and a broker is entitled to a commission under an exclusive agreement if a sales transaction occurs during the life of an agreement, whether or not the broker was the procuring cause of the transaction. The plaintiff further argues that, although there was an exclusion period applicable to MCB, the plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to a fee because the loan commitment was obtained from MCB after the end of the exclusion period and before the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement, i.e., October 6, 2020.</p>\n<p>Generally, \"[t]o prevail on a cause of action to recover a commission, the broker must establish (1) that it is duly licensed, (2) that it had a contract, express or implied, with the party to be charged with paying the commission, and (3) that it was the procuring cause of the sale\" (<i>All Is. Estates Realty Corp. v Singh</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">219 AD3d 1392</span>, 1392 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <i>see Blooming Home Realty, LLC v Infinity Holdings Northeast, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">228 AD3d 815</span>, 816). Thus, a broker seeking to recover a commission is normally required to make a showing that it was the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">216 AD3d 793</span>, 797 [involving a real estate brokerage agreement]; <i>Saunders Ventures, Inc. v Catcove Group, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\">209 AD3d 893</span>, 896 [same]; <i>Multiloan Mtge.

However, there is a distinction between brokerage agreements granting an exclusive agency and those conferring an exclusive right to sell, the latter of which permits a broker to recover a commission even if it was not the procuring cause of the transaction (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#534\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

In general, pursuant to an exclusive agency agreement, if the owner finds its own buyer, then no commission is due to the broker (<i>see U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v Hanna</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5989996\"><a href=\"/opinion/6124908/us-no-1-laffey-real-estate-v-hann/#553\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: U.S. No. 1 Laffey Real Estate v.

In other words, \"[w]here a broker has been granted an 'exclusive agency,' the seller cannot 'employ another broker,' but 'would not be precluded from itself making the sale without becoming liable to [the broker] for a commission'\" (<i>New York Commercial Realty Group, LLC v Beau Pere Real Estate, LLC</i>, 216 AD3d at 798, quoting <i>Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v Servinational, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5797685\"><a href=\"/opinion/5939275/hammond-kennedy-co-v-servinational-inc/#397\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hammond, Kennedy &amp; Co. v.

UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 535</a></span> [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]), the Court of Appeals held that \"a contract giving rise to an exclusive right of sale must clearly and expressly provide that a commission is due upon sale by the owner or exclude the owner from independently negotiating a sale.\" The Court of Appeals explained that \"[r]equiring an affirmative and unequivocal statement to establish a broker's exclusive right to sell is consistent with the general principle that an owner's freedom to dispose of her own property should not be infringed upon by mere implication\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). In that case, the plaintiff broker had entered into a financial brokerage agreement with the defendant, which the plaintiff conceded lacked a provision expressly conferring an exclusive right of sale (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The plaintiff argued that, despite the absence of such provision, the court should \"examine the contract as a whole to deduce the parties' intent to create an exclusive right to sell or, if the agreement is ambiguous, to examine parol evidence\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>). The Court of Appeals rejected that approach \"in favor of a rule that, '[w]ithout an unequivocal expression of intent by its own terms or by necessary implication from its terms, the . . . contract is at most considered to create an exclusive agency, not excluding the owner's inherent right to sell his or her own property'\" (<i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">id.</a></span></i>, quoting 11 NY Jur 2d, Brokers \u00a7 169).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i> also made clear that the rule requiring a clear statement to confer an exclusive right of sale is not limited to real estate [*4]brokerage agreements. In rejecting the plaintiff's argument seeking to apply such a limitation, the Court of Appeals stated that it saw \"no reason to apply a different rule to brokerage contracts concerning the sale of financial instruments in the investment banking context,\" noting that, \"[i]n both cases, the governing principles arise from the law of agency and contract, not from the law of real property\" (<i>id.</i> at 536).</p>\n<p>The same reasoning has been applied in the context of brokerage agreements to secure financing. For example, in <i>Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i> (<span class=\"citation no-link\">197 AD3d 1057</span>, 1058), the defendant Crosswing Holdings, LLC (hereinafter Crosswing), retained the plaintiff Silvergrove Advisors, LLC (hereinafter Silvergrove), to assist it in obtaining financing. Crosswing obtained an interim bridge loan during the life of the agreement, and Silvergrove contended that it was entitled to a success fee for the bridge loan even though it had not been involved in that transaction (<i>see <span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>). The Appellate Division, First Department, in pertinent part, upheld the determination denying that branch of Silvergrove's motion which was for summary judgment in connection with recovering that success fee, noting that \"the contractual language plainly states that Silvergrove was not given an exclusive right of sale, but was simply made defendants' exclusive broker\" (<i><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span></i>, citing <i>Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">23 NY3d 528</a></span>).</p>\n<p>In contrast, in <i>Matusik v Ward</i> (<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/#1215\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v. Ward\">68 AD3d 1213, 1215</a></span>), certain defendants had entered into an agreement to obtain financing for a hotel project with a licensed real estate salesperson associated with the plaintiff, which set forth a period of exclusivity during which time the salesperson was entitled to a commission, regardless of whether he or another party procured the financing commitment. Given this language, the Appellate Division, Third Department, held that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of liability on his cause of action to recover a commission pursuant to that agreement even though the parties disputed the extent to which the salesperson was involved in the negotiation of the loan (<i>see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5788655\"><a href=\"/opinion/5930571/matusik-v-ward/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Matusik v. Ward\">id.</a></span></i>).</p>\n<p>Applying these principles here, the defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the complaint. Initially, it is undisputed that the plaintiff did not secure a lender or loan with conforming terms on behalf of the defendant before June 20, 2020. Further, the defendant demonstrated that the plaintiff was not entitled to a commission for the loan the defendant independently obtained from MCB in August 2020. The agreement did not clearly and expressly provide the plaintiff with the exclusive right to deal or negotiate on the defendant's behalf (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v.

Hayt, Hayt &amp; Landau\">264 AD2d at 815</a></span>; <i>see also Silvergrove Advisors, LLC v Crosswing Holdings LLC</i>, 197 AD3d at 1058). The defendant also demonstrated that the plaintiff was not the procuring cause of the loan from MCB (<i>see Alta Capital Partners Intl. LLC v Parsons Cap. LLC</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4222525\"><a href=\"/opinion/4445272/alta-capital-partners-international-llc-v-parsons-capital-llc/#493\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Alta Capital Partners International LLC v.

Hayt, Hayt &amp; Landau\">264 AD2d at 815</a></span>).</p>\n<p>In opposition to the defendant's prima facie showing, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The plaintiff does not contend that the exclusion provision or any other part of the agreement is ambiguous, but rather, that the clear and unambiguous terms of the agreement entitled the plaintiff to a fee if a terms sheet was issued by MCB after June 30, 2020, but prior to the expiration of the 120-day term of the agreement. However, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, nothing in the agreement, either expressly or by necessary implication, obligated the defendant to pay a fee to the plaintiff upon the expiration of the exclusion provision on June 30, 2020 (<i>see Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v UBS AG</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5489114\"><a href=\"/opinion/5643147/morpheus-capital-advisors-llc-v-ubs-ag/#535\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Morpheus Capital Advisors LLC v. UBS AG\">23 NY3d at 535</a></span>).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the complaint and granted the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p>DILLON, J.P., VENTURA and GOLIA, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\nENTER:<p></p>\n<p>Darrell M.
